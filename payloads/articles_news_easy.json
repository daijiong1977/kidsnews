      "summary": "Government data was stolen in a hack, but officials say the risk to people is low. The data was on systems run by the Foreign Office for the Home Office. A group linked to China is suspected of doing the hack. The government is still investigating and closed the security gap quickly. They think it's unlikely that individuals were affected. The Information Commissioner's Office has been told about it. This hack could be awkward because the UK prime minister plans to visit China next year. The government says it's important to talk to China about trade and climate change, even though there are security concerns.",

      "summary": "Today is a very busy day for Christmas travel in Britain. Millions of people are driving cars, taking trains, or flying on planes to go home for the holidays. Experts say it might be the busiest Christmas ever on the roads, with over 24 million car trips expected. Airports are also crowded, with many passengers flying. Drivers are told to be patient, plan their trips ahead, and allow extra time because there could be traffic jams in places like near London, Birmingham, and other cities. Some roads are even closed for repairs, so people need to find different routes. The advice is to check traffic updates before leaving to have a safe and happy journey.",

      "title": "EU Leaders Help Ukraine with Money",
      "summary": "EU leaders had a long meeting and agreed to give Ukraine a big loan of 90 billion euros to help it fight against Russia. Ukraine needs this money to pay its soldiers and buy weapons because the US is not giving as much help now. All EU countries had to agree, but Hungary, Slovakia, and the Czech Republic only said yes if they did not have to pay. This shows that some countries in Europe are closer to Russia and do not want to help Ukraine as much. Other countries like Poland and the Baltic States think helping Ukraine is very important for keeping Europe safe. They believe if Ukraine loses, Russia might become more dangerous. The loan is a new plan instead of using frozen Russian money. The meeting was tense, but they found a way to help Ukraine.",

      "title": "Contactless Card Limits Can Change Soon",
      "summary": "Starting in March, banks and card companies can let people set their own limits for contactless card payments or even have no limit at all. This means you might be able to pay more than £100 with just a tap of your card, without needing to type a PIN. The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), a group that makes rules for money, says banks should allow customers to choose their own limits or turn off contactless if they want. Some banks already do this. Contactless cards have had different limits over the years, starting at £10 in 2007 and going up to £100 in 2021. People like using contactless because it's fast, but there are worries about thieves stealing cards. The FCA says banks will still protect customers from fraud, so if someone steals your money, you can get it back. They want to give banks more flexibility to set limits based on how safe they think it is.",

      "summary": "The economy is giving mixed signals right now. Prices are going up more slowly than expected, which is good news because it means inflation is cooling. But at the same time, job growth is weak and unemployment is high, which is bad news for people looking for work. These numbers might lead the Federal Reserve, a group that helps control the economy, to cut interest rates in 2026 to help boost jobs. Austan Goolsbee from the Chicago Fed talked about this on PBS NewsHour. He said the inflation report has a lot to like, but data collection was affected by a government shutdown, so we need to be careful. The Fed has already cut rates three times recently because they are worried about jobs.",

      "summary": "President Trump gave a speech on TV to talk about the economy. He said he has done a great job and blamed others for problems like high prices. A reporter named Liz Landers checked if what he said was true. She looked at a poll that asked people what they think about the economy. The poll showed that many people do not like how President Trump is handling the economy. This article helps us understand how to check facts in speeches to know what is real.",
