      "summary": "Lionel Messi, a famous soccer player, visited India for a special tour. Thousands of fans went to a big stadium in Kolkata to see him. They paid a lot of money for tickets, hoping to watch him play or get close to him. But Messi only walked around the field for a short time, and many people could not see him well because officials and celebrities blocked the view. He left early, which made some fans very upset. They started throwing chairs and bottles and damaged things in the stadium. The leader of West Bengal said she was shocked by what happened.

      "summary": "Sir Keir Starmer, the prime minister, says it is very risky for doctors to go on strike next week because many people are sick with the flu. The flu is spreading fast in the UK, with more people in hospitals than usual for this time of year. Doctors are planning a five-day strike to ask for better pay and working conditions. Sir Keir wants them to cancel the strike to keep patients safe. The doctors' union is asking its members if they will stop the strike after the government made a new offer. If they vote no, the strike will start on Wednesday. The flu is not more severe this year, but it is affecting many children and young people.",

      "title": "U.S. Seizes Oil Tanker to Stop Illegal Smuggling",
      "summary": "The U.S. government recently seized a big oil tanker called the Skipper near Venezuela. This ship was part of a secret group of old tankers that smuggle oil for countries like Venezuela, Russia, and Iran, which are under U.S. sanctions. These ships hide their locations by turning off or faking their tracking systems, making it hard to know where they are. The seizure is part of President Trump's plan to pressure Venezuela's leader, Nicolás Maduro, by cutting off money from oil sales. Experts say this action might scare other smugglers and make it riskier to break the rules. The tanker was carrying millions of dollars worth of illegal crude oil, and U.S. commandos used helicopters to take control of it. This shows the U.S. is getting tougher on stopping illegal oil trade.",

      "summary": "In Wisconsin, there are two court cases about changing the maps that decide who gets elected to Congress. These maps currently help Republicans win more seats. Some people want new maps ready for the 2026 elections, but others say it's too fast. Lawyers for Democrats asked judges to make a decision by March 1, 2026, so new maps can be used. However, judges and lawyers for Republicans think the cases should wait until after 2026, with a trial maybe in 2027. The judges will decide next year if they should dismiss the cases or rule without more arguments. This is the first time special three-judge panels are handling such cases in Wisconsin. The hearings happened in the same courthouse near the state Capitol.",

      "summary": "The Trump administration says that having American Sign Language interpreters at White House events, like press briefings, would make it hard for the President to control how he looks to the public. They are in a lawsuit with the National Association for the Deaf, which wants interpreters so deaf people can understand important news. The government argues that other ways, like online transcripts, are enough. A judge ordered the White House to provide interpreters, but they appealed and are still arguing about it. This is part of a bigger effort to stop diversity programs in the government.",

      "summary": "Some men give their sperm to help women have babies when they can't on their own, like if they don't have a partner or their partner can't have kids. This is called sperm donation. The BBC found one man who had 197 children from his sperm, which was sent to 14 countries. This shows how big the sperm donor business is. Sperm donation is a big industry, especially in Denmark, where it's very popular. Not all men can be donors because their sperm needs to be very healthy. Doctors check if the sperm can swim well and survive freezing. Only a few men pass these tests, so there aren't many donors. Because of this, some donors have lots of children to meet the demand. This can be a problem if the sperm has genetic issues, like raising cancer risk, as seen in one case.",
