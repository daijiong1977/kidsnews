      "summary": "The UK government is thinking about letting China build a very large new embassy in London. An embassy is like a special office where people from one country work in another country. This plan is controversial, which means some people are worried about it. For example, they might be concerned about safety or how big the building will be. Even though a final decision hasn't been made, many experts think it will probably be approved. This could affect how the UK and China work together in the future. It's important to understand that embassies help countries talk to each other and solve problems. This news is based on reports from BBC News, which is a trusted source for information.",

      "summary": "At a big meeting called COP30, countries are having a big argument about fossil fuels like coal, oil, and gas.

      "summary": "The U.S. Coast Guard is a group that helps keep people safe on the water. They made a new rule about hate symbols like swastikas and nooses. At first, they planned to call these symbols 'potentially divisive,' which means they might cause arguments. But many people, including leaders and supporters, got upset and said this was not strong enough. So, the Coast Guard quickly changed the rule to be firmer against hate symbols. This shows that when people speak up, organizations can listen and make things better. It's important to stand against hate to keep everyone safe and respected.",
