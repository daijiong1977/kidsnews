      "summary": "Donald Trump and Volodymyr Zelensky met in Florida to talk about ending the war in Ukraine. They said they made some progress, especially on security guarantees for Ukraine, which means the US might help protect Ukraine for 15 years. But they still have big problems to solve, like what will happen to the Donbas region. Russia wants to control all of Donbas, but Ukraine wants to keep some control. Both leaders think they are close to a peace deal, but they need to work more on the hard parts. They hope to stop the fighting soon.",

      "summary": "Hospitals in Sussex, England, are having a hard time helping patients who are very sick and near the end of their lives. A doctor told other health leaders that there are too many end-of-life patients in hospital beds, which might stop other sick people from getting treatment this winter. Sometimes, these patients have to be cared for in emergency room corridors because there are not enough beds or places in hospices. The doctor said this is a crisis that is getting worse. Hospitals are trying to find better ways to care for these patients, like in community settings or hospices, so they don't have to stay in the hospital. This problem could happen in other areas too as winter brings more sick people to hospitals.",

His partner had health problems after their baby was born, so Ryan had to take care of her and their son Leo all by himself.

      "summary": "Guinea, a country in Africa, held an election on Sunday to choose a new president. This was the first election since a coup in 2021, when the military took over. The junta leader, General Mamadi Doumbouya, is likely to win because the opposition is weak. Guinea has many minerals like bauxite, but many people are poor and hungry. Young people hope the election will bring better jobs and life. Voting was mostly smooth, but some people boycotted it. The results will come soon, and if no one gets most votes, there will be another round. This election is part of a new rule that lets military leaders run and makes the president's term longer.",

      "summary": "In Kosovo, a country in Europe, Prime Minister Albin Kurti's party won a big victory in an early election. The election happened on Sunday, and his party, called Vetevendosje, got almost half of all votes. This means he will likely stay as prime minister. The election was called early because his party could not form a government after another election in February, which caused a long delay. Kurti said they have a lot of work to do now. Supporters celebrated in the capital city, Pristina. Kosovo is a young country that became independent from Serbia in 2008 after a war. The country has not approved a budget for next year, which worries people about the economy. About 44% of voters turned out to vote.",
