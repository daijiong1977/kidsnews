      "title": "Ukraine's allies voice concerns over US plan to end war",
      "summary": "Ukraine's allies have voiced concerns over a US plan to end the Russia-Ukraine war, saying draft proposals are \"a basis which will require additional work\".\n\nIn a joint statement at the G20 summit in South Africa, they said the plan \"includes important elements that will be essential for a just and lasting peace\", but cited concerns over borders and limitations on Ukraine's armed forces.\n\nIt comes a day after Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky warned Kyiv faced \"one of the most difficult moments in our history\" over pressure to accept the plan - leaked details of which have been seen as favourable to Moscow.\n\nUS President Donald Trump has given Ukraine until 27 November to accept the 28-point plan, while Russia's President Vladimir Putin said it could be the \"basis\" for a settlement.\n\nSaturday's joint statement was signed by the leaders of Canada, Finland, France, Ireland, Italy, Japan, the Netherlands, Spain, the UK, Germany and Norway. Two top EU officials also signed it.\n\nThe statement said: \"We are ready to engage in order to ensure that a future peace is sustainable. We are clear on the principle that borders must not be changed by force.\n\n\"We are also concerned by the proposed limitations on Ukraine's armed forces, which would leave Ukraine vulnerable to future attack.\"\n\nIt added: \"The implementation of elements relating to the European Union and relating to Nato would need the consent of EU and Nato members respectively\".\n\nThe widely leaked US peace plan proposes Ukrainian troops withdraw from the part of the eastern Donetsk region that they currently control, and de facto Russian control of Donetsk, as well as the neighbouring Luhansk region and the southern Crimea peninsula annexed by Russia in 2014.\n\nThe plan also includes freezing the borders of Ukraine's southern Kherson and Zaporizhzhia regions along the current battle lines. Both regions are partially occupied by Russia.\n\nThe US draft would also limit Ukraine's military to 600,000 personnel, with European fighter jets stationed in neighbouring Poland.\n\nKyiv would receive \"reliable security guarantees\", the plan says, although no details have been given. The document says \"it is expected\" that Russia will not invade its neighbours and Nato will not expand further.\n\nThe plan also suggests Russia will be \"reintegrated into the global economy\", through the lifting of sanctions and by inviting Russia to rejoin the G7 group of the world's most powerful countries - making it the G8 again.\n\nOn Friday, Trump said Zelensky would \"have to like\" the US proposals, adding otherwise Ukraine and Russia would continue fighting.\n\nEarlier in the day, the Ukrainian leader addressed the nation with a stark warning that the country \"might face a very difficult choice: either losing dignity, or risk losing a key partner\".",

      "summary": "A company called Daily Mail and General Trust, which publishes the Daily Mail newspaper, has agreed to buy the Daily Telegraph and Sunday Telegraph for £500 million. This means they will own these famous newspapers. The deal needs to be approved by the Culture Secretary in the UK to make sure it is good for the public. The chairman of DMGT said he really likes the Telegraph and wants to help it grow into a global brand, while keeping it independent from their other papers. Some people are worried that having too few companies own many newspapers might not be fair for competition. The companies hope the deal will be done quickly.",

      "title": "New Study on Medicine for Kids Who Question Their Gender",
      "summary": "In the UK, a new study is starting to learn about puberty blockers, which are medicines that can delay puberty in children. This study will look at how these drugs affect kids' bodies, feelings, and social lives. It involves about 220 children under 16 who are going through puberty and feel their gender doesn't match their body. Last year, the UK banned these drugs for regular use because there wasn't enough proof they are safe. Now, doctors can only give them as part of research. Some people worry if this study is right or fair. The researchers say they want to help families make better choices by understanding the benefits and risks. Puberty blockers have been used to help kids with gender distress, but the Cass review showed we need more information. This trial will check physical health and even brain development for the first time.",

      "summary": "Texas is asking the Supreme Court to let them use a new map for elections that helps Republicans win more seats. A group of judges said this map might be unfair to Black and Hispanic voters because it could be based on race. Texas wants to use the map quickly because primary elections are coming in March. If the Supreme Court says no, Texas might have to use an older map from 2021. This is part of a bigger fight across the country where states are changing their election maps, and courts are deciding if they are fair. It's important because it affects who gets to vote and who wins in elections.",
