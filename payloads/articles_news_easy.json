      "title": "A Ski Bar Fire in Switzerland",
      "summary": "A fire happened at a ski bar in Switzerland on New Year's Eve, and many people were hurt or died. Families are sad and surprised because the bar had not been checked for safety in five years. Officials said the bar should have been checked every year to make sure it was safe. The fire started when sparklers on champagne bottles lit up foam on the ceiling. The bar managers are being investigated, and they said they are very sorry. The mayor promised to ban sparklers in bars to prevent more fires. Most of the people who were hurt or died were young, and some are still in the hospital. This story shows why safety checks are important to keep people safe.",

      "summary": "The US government, led by President Donald Trump, is talking about getting Greenland, which is part of Denmark. They say it's important for safety. The White House mentioned they might use the military to do this. Denmark and Greenland don't want this and say Greenland belongs to its people. Other European countries like the UK and France support Denmark. They all agree that only Denmark and Greenland can decide about Greenland. The US also talked about buying Greenland instead of using force. This is causing a big argument between the US and its friends in NATO, a group of countries that help each other in war. Everyone is worried about keeping peace in the Arctic, a cold area near the North Pole.",

      "summary": "World leaders met in Paris to talk about peace in Ukraine. They wanted to keep the United States involved. But there was a big problem: Greenland. Greenland is a huge island that belongs to Denmark. U.S. President Donald Trump says he wants Greenland for U.S. safety. Denmark's leader was at the meeting. She is friends with many European countries and the UK. These countries do not want to make Trump angry. They said that security in the Arctic should be a team effort with NATO, including the U.S., and that Denmark and Greenland should decide about themselves. But the White House quickly said no. They are thinking about ways to get Greenland, like buying it or using the military. This scared European leaders because Trump had just sent troops to Venezuela. Now, they are taking Trump's Greenland idea seriously and are very worried.",

      "summary": "President Trump wants American companies to go to Venezuela and fix its oil industry. Venezuela has a lot of oil, but it is not producing much because of problems inside the country and U.S. rules called sanctions. Only one American company, Chevron, is allowed to work there right now. The president says the U.S. government could pay some money to help the companies rebuild the oil equipment. He hopes this will let more companies invest and make money. Venezuela took control of its oil from other countries many years ago, which makes it hard for outsiders to help now. A professor named Francisco Monaldi explains these issues in the article.",

      "title": "What is the Trump Doctrine?",
      "summary": "This article talks about a new idea called the Trump Doctrine. It is about how President Trump wants to use strong actions, like pressure and military power, in foreign policy. This means the U.S. might use force not only against enemies but also against friends. The article includes views from two experts: Todd Robinson, who was a U.S. ambassador in Venezuela, and Andrés Martínez-Fernández from The Heritage Foundation. They discuss how this doctrine changes America's role in the world, especially in Latin America. The focus is on being more aggressive and less restrained, which is different from past policies. The article helps us understand what the Trump Doctrine is and why it matters.",

      "summary": "Tailyr Irvine is a photographer from the Flathead Reservation in Montana. She takes pictures of Native American communities to show their everyday lives and strength, not just traditional clothes or sad stories. She wants people to see that Native Americans are just like everyone else. Her project is about a rule called blood quantum, which is a fraction that tells how much Native someone is. This rule can affect who Native Americans marry and have families with. Tailyr believes photography can connect people and show we are all similar. She was inspired by photos from 9/11 and now tells stories from her home to help others understand.",
