      "title": "Artists' Campaign for Regulatory Reform in Ticket Resale Markets",
      "summary": "In a significant move within the entertainment sector, Dua Lipa and Coldplay have endorsed a formal appeal to governmental bodies, advocating for stringent measures against ticket touts through the implementation of resale price caps.

This initiative is situated within broader discourses on market regulation, consumer protection, and the ethical responsibilities of public figures. By leveraging their influential platforms, Lipa and Coldplay aim to catalyze policy changes that could reshape ticketing infrastructures, emphasizing transparency and fairness. The article illuminates the interplay between celebrity advocacy and regulatory frameworks, suggesting potential impacts on industry practices and fan engagement. Ultimately, this case study reflects evolving norms in how entertainment industries address systemic challenges, highlighting the role of collective action in driving socio-economic reforms.",
