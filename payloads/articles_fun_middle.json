      "title": "Comparing Historical and Modern 'Battle of the Sexes' Tennis Matches",
      "summary": "Tennis legend Billie Jean King reflects on the differences between her iconic 1973 'Battle of the Sexes' match against Bobby Riggs and a contemporary exhibition between Aryna Sabalenka and Nick Kyrgios, also labeled under the same banner. King's match, watched by an estimated 90 million people, was a pivotal moment in the women's rights movement, symbolizing the fight for gender equality in sports. In contrast, she views the upcoming Sabalenka-Kyrgios match as mere entertainment, lacking the social significance of her era. King emphasizes that her victory over Riggs, played under standard rules without modifications, contributed to cultural change, whereas the new match includes altered conditions such as a smaller court for Sabalenka based on data about female players' speed. While she supports Sabalenka, King asserts that the matches share only the basic gender dynamic, with hers driven by activism and the current one by spectacle. This highlights ongoing debates about the representation of women in sports and the evolution of such events from social statements to commercialized exhibitions.",

      "title": "Iceland Joins Eurovision Boycott Over Israel's Participation",
      "summary": "Iceland has become the fifth country to announce a boycott of the 2026 Eurovision Song Contest, following Spain, Ireland, Slovenia, and the Netherlands. This decision stems from Israel's confirmed participation in the competition, which has sparked tension due to the ongoing war in Gaza and concerns about voting integrity. Stefan Eiriksson, director-general of Icelandic broadcaster RÚV, stated that there is currently no peace or joy associated with the contest, leading Iceland to withdraw. RÚV highlighted that Israel's involvement has created disunity within the European Broadcasting Union (EBU) and among the public. The boycott was finalized just before the participation deadline for the 70th anniversary edition. Eurovision director Martin Green expressed respect for the decision while hoping for a future return. Additionally, new voting measures were approved by the EBU to address integrity issues, but Iceland remains skeptical about their effectiveness. Previously, Iceland had advocated for banning Israel from the contest, but this request was denied, linking Israel's participation to new rules instead.",
