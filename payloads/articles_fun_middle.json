      "summary": "Dua Lipa and Coldplay, prominent musicians, have taken a stand against ticket touts by signing a formal letter urging government intervention. Ticket touts, or scalpers, purchase large quantities of event tickets and resell them at inflated prices, exploiting fans and undermining fair access to concerts. The artists have committed to capping resale prices, which involves setting maximum limits on how much tickets can be resold for, aiming to prevent excessive profiteering. This action highlights growing concerns in the entertainment industry about the ethics of ticket sales and the need for regulatory measures. By involving the government, they seek to enforce policies that protect consumers and promote transparency in the ticketing market. The move reflects a broader trend where celebrities use their influence to address social issues, emphasizing the importance of affordability and equity in live events. Ultimately, this effort could lead to more sustainable and fan-friendly practices in the music world.",
