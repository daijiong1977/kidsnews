      "summary": "Pop icon Britney Spears has sold the rights to her entire music catalogue to the independent publisher Primary Wave for approximately $200 million. This sale, which occurred on December 30, includes hits such as '...Baby One More Time', 'Oops!... I Did It Again', 'Toxic', and 'Gimme More', spanning nine studio albums since her 1999 debut. Spears, who has sold over 150 million records globally, made this move after ending a 13-year conservatorship in 2021, a legal arrangement that gave her father control over her finances and personal life. In January 2024, she stated she would 'never return to the music industry', with her last release being a 2022 duet with Elton John. The sale aligns with a trend among high-profile artists like Bruce Springsteen and Justin Bieber, who have also sold their catalogues for substantial sums. Primary Wave, founded by Lawrence Mestel, has previously acquired rights to estates of artists like Notorious BIG and Prince. Details of the transaction remain private, highlighting Spears' ongoing efforts to reclaim autonomy post-conservatorship.",

      "summary": "A Disney advertisement for the sci-fi film Predator Badlands has been banned by the Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) after complaints from parents. The digital poster, displayed in Giffnock, Glasgow, featured a large alien character holding a severed body, which parents argued was inappropriate and disturbing for young children. Disney defended the ad, stating that the severed figure was a robot, or 'synth', and its non-human nature was emphasized by the severing. The company noted the ad was brief, with the scene lasting less than two seconds, and had been reviewed by third parties. However, the ASA ruled that the ad breached rules by being menacing and likely to cause distress to a general audience, including children, emphasizing Disney's responsibility to ensure ad content is suitable for all viewers. The incident highlights ongoing debates about advertising standards and the protection of young audiences from potentially frightening media.",

      "title": "Ford's Financial Challenges: Tariff Surprises and EV Strategy Shift",
      "summary": "Ford Motor Company reported an unexpected $900 million increase in tariff costs for last year, totaling around $2 billion, due to a last-minute change by the Trump administration to a tariff relief program. This program was designed to help automakers offset tariffs on imported parts by providing credits, but a delayed effective date reduced Ford's anticipated benefits. Additionally, Ford faced significant financial losses from shifting its electric vehicle (EV) strategy. The company abandoned plans for large EVs, citing weak consumer demand and regulatory changes, which contributed to a $19.5 billion charge and a fourth-quarter net loss of $11.1 billion. In response, Ford is now investing in hybrid vehicles, gas-powered models, and smaller, more affordable EVs to improve profitability. Despite these setbacks, Ford's quarterly revenue exceeded analysts' expectations, and executives forecast higher profits and reduced EV losses for the coming year, leading to a slight rise in its stock price. The article also notes similar challenges at General Motors, which took a $1.6 billion hit from scaling back EV ambitions.",

      "title": "US Consumer Spending Slows in December: Economic Implications",
      "summary": "In December 2025, US retail sales remained unchanged from November, marking an unexpected slowdown during the holiday season and raising concerns about a potential economic downturn. This break from robust spending in previous months was influenced by factors such as a faltering labor market, persistent inflation, and cooling wage growth. The Commerce Department report highlighted declines in specific consumer categories, including furniture stores (down 0.9%) and clothing retailers (down 0.7%), though overall sales increased 2.4% year-over-year. Economists caution that this weakness might be temporary, noting that consumer spending accounts for over two-thirds of US economic activity. They point to possible rebounds driven by tax refunds, Federal Reserve interest rate cuts from the previous year, and stabilization in labor market conditions. The data, delayed due to a government shutdown, is part of broader economic releases that will help assess the economy's strength amid underlying weaknesses.",
