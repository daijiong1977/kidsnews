      "summary": "Stranger Things has concluded its 10-year run with an epic two-hour finale titled 'Chapter Eight: The Rightside Up,' which briefly overwhelmed Netflix's servers due to high viewer demand. Released at 01:00 GMT, the finale attracted fans globally, with some attending special cinema screenings in the US and Canada, often featuring appearances by the show's stars. Set in Hawkins, Indiana, the series debuted in 2016 and stars actors like Millie Bobby Brown. The episode included intense battle scenes and emotional tributes that tied together all five seasons, providing closure for beloved characters. However, the finale also faced scrutiny from fans who pointed out narrative gaps and anachronisms, such as a jacket with a logo from a brand that didn't exist in the show's timeline. Throughout the season, fans engaged in extensive theorizing on social media, predicting elements like time travel or character deaths, with some theories proving accurate while others did not. The Duffer Brothers, the creators, faced pressure to deliver a satisfying end to this 1980s-inspired, monster-filled series, balancing anticipation and criticism.",

      "title": "UK Implements Stricter Crypto Tax Reporting Rules",
      "summary": "Starting January 1st, the UK has introduced new regulations requiring cryptocurrency users to share their account details with HMRC, the country's tax authority. This change aims to ensure compliance with tax obligations, particularly capital gains tax on profits from buying and selling cryptocurrencies. HMRC will automatically collect data from cryptocurrency exchanges, which function as banks for the industry, to address high levels of non-compliance and recover tens of millions in unpaid taxes. The move is part of broader efforts by financial regulators to tighten oversight of the crypto market, including preventing insider trading. Bitcoin's volatile price fluctuations in 2025 highlighted potential taxable gains, but authorities have historically struggled to track these transactions. Under the Cryptoasset Reporting Framework (CARF), exchanges must provide accurate and up-to-date user earnings information, facilitating international cooperation among tax bodies. HMRC estimates thousands of crypto owners owe unpaid taxes and projects collecting at least £300 million over five years. Taxpayers with gains from the 2024-25 financial year must file returns by January 31st, and a disclosure facility allows voluntary correction for earlier years.",

      "summary": "Maggie O'Farrell, the author of the award-winning novel Hamnet, has revealed her long-standing desire for actor Paul Mescal to portray William Shakespeare in the film adaptation. She first noticed Mescal's talent years ago when he performed as Stephen Dedalus in a Dublin production of James Joyce's work, prior to his rise to fame in Normal People. The film, based on O'Farrell's fictional exploration of Shakespeare's life, centers on the impact of the death of his son Hamnet and its potential influence on the creation of Hamlet. O'Farrell, who has Irish roots and grew up in Britain, emphasized the Irish essence of the movie, with Jessie Buckley cast as Agnes, Shakespeare's wife. She humorously questioned director Chloé Zhao's casting process, suggesting it resembled a holiday in Ireland rather than traditional auditions. O'Farrell supported Zhao's choice of Buckley, praising her performance. In discussing her research, O'Farrell noted the abundance of literature on Shakespeare, highlighting the enduring fascination with his life and works.",
