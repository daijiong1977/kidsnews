      "summary": "The Centre for Contemporary Arts (CCA) in Glasgow is permanently closing due to severe financial instability, despite receiving £3.4 million in multi-year funding from Creative Scotland just last year. All staff have been made redundant with minimal notice, and upcoming events are cancelled. The venue, which opened in 1992, faced ongoing controversies, including recent demands from pro-Palestine artists for an official boycott of Israel, which sparked protests and criticism of the board's ethical policies. Financial irregularities, such as unexplained expenses and payment issues, were highlighted by a whistleblower, leading Creative Scotland to halt further payments because the CCA could not demonstrate viability. The board attempted restructuring with new appointments, but ultimately failed to achieve sustainability, entering liquidation. Staff expressed devastation, citing prolonged uncertainty and governance failures, while Creative Scotland aims to explore reopening options. This closure impacts the local and international arts community, highlighting challenges in arts funding and management.",

      "summary": "The Pokémon Company cancelled a planned card game event at Tokyo's Yasukuni Shrine after facing significant backlash from China. The event, advertised on Pokémon's official website, was organized by a third party but sparked controversy due to the shrine's history. Yasukuni Shrine commemorates Japanese war dead, including over 1,000 convicted war criminals, making it a sensitive site for nations like China that suffered under Japanese occupation. Pokémon apologized for the lack of due diligence in approving the event and stated it should not have been held. This incident occurred during heightened tensions between China and Japan, partly over Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi's comments on Taiwan. Chinese state media, such as the People's Daily and Global Times, criticized the event as disrespectful to history and an affront to victims, urging brands to take social responsibility. Pokémon responded by cancelling the event promptly and promising to strengthen its approval processes to prevent future issues.",
