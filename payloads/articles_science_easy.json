      "summary": "AIOps harnesses AI to enhance enterprise security and operations\n\nWhen you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works.\n\nArtificial intelligence (AI) isn't just another trend – it's a powerful force reshaping the very foundation of business operations.\n\nMuch like the internet catalyzed a global transformation decades ago, AI is now leading a new digital revolution. This wave of innovation is compelling organizations to reconsider, re-envision, and reinvent every aspect of their operational strategy.\n\nAt the forefront of this transformation within the technology sector is AI for IT operations (AIOps). It represents a seismic shift in how complex technology ecosystems are managed and maintained.\n\nAIOps isn't merely about adding AI to an existing IT infrastructure management framework; it's a sophisticated practice that integrates human expertise with the analytical power of AI, machine learning (ML), and advanced operational methodologies.\n\nAVP, global strategic alliances at NETSCOUT.\n\nThe goal is to fundamentally enhance how businesses manage their operational data, support critical human decision-making, and automate tasks that were once labor-intensive.\n\nIn years gone by, every facet of IT operations – from monitoring server health to scheduling workloads – required constant human oversight.\n\nNow, with the advent of sophisticated AIOps solutions, businesses can automate a vast range of these critical functions, freeing up human talent to focus on more strategic initiatives.\n\nSign up to the TechRadar Pro newsletter to get all the top news, opinion, features and guidance your business needs to succeed!\n\nThe primary driver for AIOps adoption is its ability to directly address the shortcomings associated with conventional IT management tools. While human expertise is invaluable in interpreting complex data, it can also lead to inaccuracies and inefficiencies, particularly when handling large-scale datasets.\n\nAIOps platforms are designed to overcome these challenges. When fed with high-quality, relevant data, an AIOps system can quickly identify opportunities to improve decision-making and automate processes across IT operations, cybersecurity, and other network domains.\n\nOne of the most significant benefits is the enhancement of application performance and security. AIOps tools sift through the noise of immense data streams to pull out the crucial insights teams need to understand precisely what is occurring across their network and in their applications.\n\nThis provides a clear, comprehensive understanding of issues like performance degradation or system outages, enabling teams to make faster and more confident decisions.",

      "title": "Rapid fault healing could rewrite earthquake physics",
      "summary": "Earthquake faults located deep within the planet can reconnect after a seismic disturbance, according to new research from the University of California, Davis. The study, published Nov. 19 in Science Advances and supported by National Science Foundation grants, introduces a new factor that could reshape how scientists interpret fault behavior linked to major earthquakes.\n\n\"We discovered that deep faults can heal themselves within hours,\" said Amanda Thomas, professor of earth and planetary sciences at UC Davis and corresponding author on the paper. \"This prompts us to reevaluate fault rheological behavior, and if we have been neglecting something very important.\"\n\nSlow Slip Events and Shifting Stress\n\nThomas, UC Davis colleague Professor James Watkins and their team investigated slow slip events, or SSEs, which resemble extremely slow earthquakes.\n\nRegular earthquakes happen when stresses that accumulate as tectonic plates grind together over centuries or millennia are suddenly released, creating intense shaking that lasts only seconds.\n\nAround 2002, Thomas said, researchers identified a different kind of seismic activity. In a slow slip event, stresses that build for months to years are relieved in movements of only a few centimeters that occur gradually over days, weeks or months.\n\nRepeating Slip in the Cascadia Subduction Zone\n\nTo better understand these deep events, the team examined seismic data from the Cascadia Subduction Zone in the Pacific Northwest, where the Juan de Fuca plate is sliding beneath the North American plate. Slow slip events here do not behave like typical earthquakes. The same fault segment can slip again within hours or days, which indicates the fault has partially regained strength and that stress has returned very quickly.\n\nThomas noted that even small tidal forces reveal how rapidly stress can rebuild. The gravitational pull of the Sun and Moon affects the Earth's crust just as it influences ocean tides. In addition, the shifting weight of seawater also applies pressure to the rocks below.\n\nThe remaining question is how the fault manages to recover so quickly.\n\nHigh-Pressure Experiments Reveal Rapid Healing\n\nWatkins, a geochemist who specializes in the behavior of minerals at high temperature and pressure, used laboratory equipment capable of simulating the conditions found deep in the crust or beneath a volcano.\n\nTo recreate the aftermath of a slow slip event, Watkins and Thomas packed powdered quartz into a silver cylinder, sealed it, and placed it under 1 Gigapascal of pressure (10,000 times atmospheric pressure) at 500 degrees Celsius.\n\n\"We're simulating what happens in the aftermath of a slow slip event,\" Watkins said. \"We cook it and look at it.\"\n\nThe researchers measured the speed of soundwaves traveling through the treated quartz, then opened the cylinders and examined the samples using electron microscopy.",

      "title": "Why Some Volcanoes Don't Explode",
      "summary": "Volcanoes can erupt in different ways. Some explode with a big bang, while others just let lava flow out slowly. Scientists used to think that gas bubbles in magma only form when the pressure drops, like when you open a soda bottle and bubbles appear. But now, they found another reason: shear forces. Shear forces happen when magma moves at different speeds inside the volcano, kind of like stirring honey. This can make bubbles form deep down and let gas escape early, so the volcano doesn't explode. For example, Mount St. Helens and Quizapu volcano sometimes have gentle eruptions even with lots of gas. This new discovery helps us understand volcanoes better and keep people safe.",

      "summary": "This article explains that smoking even a small number of cigarettes each day can be very harmful to your heart and health. Scientists looked at many studies and found that people who smoke just two to five cigarettes a day have a much higher chance of getting heart disease or dying early compared to those who never smoke. The good news is that if you quit smoking, your risk goes down over time, but it can take many years to get back to the same level as non-smokers. This is important because some people think smoking a little is okay, but it's not. The research shows that quitting completely is the best way to protect your heart and live a longer, healthier life.",

      "title": "How Hormones Help Us Learn",
      "summary": "Scientists have discovered that hormones, like estrogen, can change how our brains learn and make decisions. In a study with rats, they found that when estrogen levels change, it affects dopamine, a brain chemical that helps us feel rewarded and learn new things. This means that hormones can make learning easier or harder at different times. The researchers did experiments where rats learned to get water by listening to sounds. By watching the rats' brains, they saw that estrogen and dopamine work together to help with learning. This discovery could help us understand why some people have trouble learning or have mental health issues. It shows that hormones are important for how our brains work every day.",

      "summary": "In October 2025, four men stole valuable jewels from the Louvre Museum in Paris. They wore bright vests like construction workers and used a furniture lift, so no one noticed them. This happened because people often ignore things that look normal. The article explains that this idea also applies to AI, which is a type of smart computer. AI can make similar mistakes by not seeing things that don't fit its learned patterns. Understanding this helps us see how both humans and AI can be tricked by appearances.",
