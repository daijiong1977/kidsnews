      "title": "Solving a 700-Year-Old Royal Murder Mystery",
      "summary": "Scientists have used new tools to solve a very old mystery about a duke who was killed long ago. Duke Béla of Macsó was a young nobleman who lived 700 years ago. He had family roots from Scandinavia and the Rurik dynasty. In 1272, he was attacked and killed in a planned and emotional way. Researchers studied his bones and other clues to find out how he died and who he was. This discovery helps us learn more about history and how science can answer big questions from the past. It shows that even after many years, we can uncover secrets using genetics and forensics.",

      "summary": "Hypersonic flight could one day make long-haul travel as quick as a short movie. Researchers are testing how turbulence behaves at extreme speeds, a critical hurdle for designing these aircraft. Their laser-based krypton experiments suggest turbulence at Mach 6 behaves more like slower airflow than expected. The results could simplify hypersonic vehicle design and accelerate progress toward ultra-fast travel.",

      "title": "Big Hole Found in China That Tells a New Story About Earth",
      "summary": "Scientists have found a huge hole in China that was made when a big rock from space hit Earth a long time ago. This hole is in Guangdong, and it is 900 meters wide, which is much bigger than other holes from the same time. The rock that hit Earth was a meteorite, and it made the ground shake and break. Scientists found special rocks called quartz that show signs of being hit very hard. This hole is special because it did not wear away over time, even though the area usually has a lot of rain and wind that can destroy things. This discovery helps us learn more about what happened to Earth in the past and how meteorites can change our planet. It is exciting because it shows that big events like this can happen and leave marks that last for thousands of years.",

      "title": "Stone Age Dogs: How They Changed Long Ago",
      "summary": "Scientists have discovered that dogs started to look different a very long time ago, during the Stone Age. This means that the way dogs look today, with all their shapes and sizes, began much earlier than we used to think. By studying old bones and fossils, researchers found that early dogs were already changing in size and shape. This helps us understand how dogs evolved from wolves and became our best friends. It's exciting because it shows that dogs have been diverse for thousands of years, not just recently. This study used science to look back in time and learn about our furry companions.",

      "title": "Building Small Nuclear Power in Wales",
      "summary": "In north Wales, the UK is building its first small nuclear power station. This station will use small modular reactors, which are like tiny, safe nuclear machines that make electricity. At first, three reactors will be built, but there could be up to eight in the future. This project is important because it helps create clean energy without pollution, which is better for our planet. It will also provide jobs for people in the area and make sure we have enough power for homes and schools. Nuclear power is a way to get energy without burning fossil fuels like coal or oil, which can harm the environment. The government and companies are working together to make this happen safely. This is a big step for the UK in using new technology to fight climate change and keep the lights on.",

      "title": "A New Planet That Might Have Aliens",
      "summary": "Scientists have found a new planet called a super-Earth that is not too far away from us. It is 20 light-years away, which is very far, but it is one of the closest planets we know that could have life. This planet is in the habitable zone, which means it is not too hot or too cold, so water could be there. Water is important for life as we know it. The discovery was made using special tools called spectrographs and by watching the sky for many years with telescopes. This is exciting because it gives us a great chance to look for signs of aliens, like tiny living things. Scientists are hopeful and will keep studying this planet to learn more.",
