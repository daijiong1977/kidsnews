      "title": "Ants Choose More Friends Over Strong Armor",
      "summary": "This article is about ants and how they evolved to have many workers instead of strong armor. Scientists studied ants from all over the world using special 3D scans to see their exoskeletons, which is like their armor. They found that ants with big colonies, meaning lots of ants living together, have thinner armor. This is because if a colony has thousands of ants, losing a few to predators is not a big problem, so they don't need to spend energy making each ant super strong. Instead, they use that energy to make more ants. This trade-off helps ants survive and spread to new places faster. The research shows how teamwork in nature can lead to success by focusing on numbers over individual strength.",

      "title": "A Coal Plant Stays Open: A Story About Energy and Decisions",
      "summary": "In Washington state, a coal power plant was supposed to close and switch to natural gas to reduce pollution, as planned for 15 years. But the Trump administration's Energy Secretary, Chris Wright, said there is an electricity emergency and ordered the plant to keep burning coal for 90 more days. State leaders like Governor Bob Ferguson disagree, saying there is no real emergency and the plant is almost shut down. Meanwhile, Washington is dealing with a real emergency from heavy rain and floods. The article also talks about how the region uses a lot of electricity for things like data centers and electric cars, which might cause future power shortages. People are arguing about whether keeping the coal plant open is the right choice.",

      "title": "Scientists Find Hidden Switches in Our DNA That Help Fight Alzheimer's Disease",
      "summary": "Our DNA is like a big instruction book for our bodies, but only a tiny part of it, about 2%, contains genes that tell our cells what to do. The rest, called 'junk DNA,' was thought to be useless, but scientists have discovered it has important switches that control genes. Researchers from UNSW Sydney studied brain cells called astrocytes, which help neurons and are linked to Alzheimer's disease. They tested nearly 1000 DNA switches, called enhancers, in lab-grown astrocytes and found about 150 that work. These enhancers turn genes on or off, and many of them control genes related to Alzheimer's. This discovery helps scientists understand how Alzheimer's develops and could lead to new treatments by focusing on these hidden switches in our DNA.",

      "title": "A Girl Gets a New Heart and Liver to Save Her Life",
      "summary": "Doctors at Children's Hospital Colorado did something amazing for the first time: they gave an 11-year-old girl named Gracie both a new heart and a new liver in one big surgery. Gracie was born with a heart problem called hypoplastic left heart syndrome, which means her heart had only one working part. She had surgeries when she was little to help her heart work better, but over time, it hurt her liver too. The doctors watched her closely for years and decided she needed two new organs to live a healthy life. Many specialists worked together for 16 hours to do the transplants. First, they put in the new heart, then they used a special machine to keep the new liver safe while they finished. This surgery is very rare—only 38 kids in the whole country have had it before. Thanks to the doctors' hard work and another family donating organs, Gracie now has a chance to be happy and active again.",

      "summary": "This article talks about exciting space news from around the world. In 2025, new rockets like Blue Origin's New Glenn and China's Zhuque-3 flew for the first time, with some trying to land back on Earth. Rocket Lab launched small satellites for NASA and the Space Force to test a new flat-shaped satellite called DiskSat, which is like a pizza and can be stacked. SpaceX warned about a close call between a Chinese satellite and a Starlink satellite in space, saying they need better coordination. A South Korean company, Innospace, is getting ready to launch its small rocket from Brazil to send tiny satellites into space. The article shares updates on rockets, satellites, and safety in space.",

      "title": "How Brain Cells Help Mice See Again After Injury",
      "summary": "Scientists used to think that brain cells, called neurons, cannot grow back after they are hurt. But a new study with mice shows something amazing. When mice had a brain injury that affected their vision, some cells in their eyes and brains did not die. Instead, these surviving cells grew extra tiny branches, like tree branches, to connect with more brain cells. This helped the mice see better again, even though some cells were lost. The study also found that male mice recovered their vision faster than female mice. This research helps scientists understand how the brain can heal itself after injuries, which might lead to better treatments for people with brain problems in the future.",
