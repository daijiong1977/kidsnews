      "title": "Scientists Find New Rule for Tiny Engines",
      "summary": "Scientists at the University of Stuttgart discovered that an old rule about how engines work does not apply to very tiny engines at the atomic scale. This rule, called the Carnot principle, was made 200 years ago for big engines like steam turbines. The scientists found that when particles are linked together in tiny systems, quantum effects allow these small engines to be more efficient than larger ones. This means they can convert heat into movement better than expected. Their work, published in Science Advances, could help create super-small and energy-efficient quantum motors in the future, which might be used in medical nanobots or other tiny machines.",

      "title": "Shining Light to Make New Materials",
      "summary": "Scientists have found a cool new way to change materials by using light and tiny particles called excitons. Normally, when you shine very strong light on a material like a semiconductor, it can get new abilities for a short time, but the light might damage it. This is part of something called Floquet engineering. Now, researchers from places like Okinawa and Stanford discovered that excitons, which are like pairs of electrons and holes in materials, can do this job better. Excitons connect more strongly to the material than light does, so they can create big changes without hurting the material. This could help make future quantum devices that are super fast and smart. The idea is like pushing a swing at the right time to make it go higher—here, the repeating push comes from excitons or light to tweak how electrons behave. This breakthrough might lead to new types of computers and materials we haven't seen before.",

      "title": "How Tiny Spins Change a Big Quantum Effect",
      "summary": "Scientists study tiny spins, which are like little magnets inside materials. When many spins work together, they create special effects. One important effect is called the Kondo effect, which happens when spins interact with moving electrons. It is hard to study because electrons do many things at once. Researchers made a simple model with only spins to understand it better. They wondered if changing the size of the spins changes the effect. A team from Osaka Metropolitan University built a material with spins of size 1/2 and then size 1. They found that for spin-1/2, the Kondo effect stops magnetism, but for spin-1, it makes magnetism stronger. This shows that spin size can flip the effect, helping us learn about quantum materials.",

      "title": "A Blood Test Difference Can Warn About Kidney Problems",
      "summary": "Doctors use blood tests to check how well kidneys work. Two common tests measure creatinine and cystatin C. A new study found that when these tests give very different results, it can be an early warning sign. People with big differences are more likely to have kidney failure, heart disease, or even die. The study looked at over 860,000 adults from different countries and followed them for 11 years. Researchers say using both tests together gives a better picture of kidney health than using just one. This helps doctors find problems earlier, so patients can get treatment sooner and avoid serious issues like dialysis. Kidney disease is a big problem worldwide, so better testing is important.",

      "title": "Ancient Hand Painting Shows Early Human Creativity",
      "summary": "Scientists found a very old painting of a hand in a cave on an island called Sulawesi in Indonesia. This painting is special because it is the oldest known cave art in the world, made at least 67,800 years ago. It shows a red outline of a hand that looks like a claw, which means people long ago were starting to think in creative ways. This discovery helps us learn that humans were making art and telling stories much earlier than we thought, not just in Europe but in other places too. It shows that creativity is a natural part of being human, going back to our origins in Africa. The painting was made by someone pressing their hand against a cave wall and blowing red pigment around it to leave a hand shape. This find changes what we know about when humans began to use symbols and imagination.",

      "summary": "A new report says that when nature gets sick, it can make the UK less safe and prosperous. The report was made by a group that looks at security risks. It warns that if important places like rainforests and coral reefs collapse, it could cause problems like fights over resources, people moving to new places, and higher food prices. The UK gets a lot of food from other countries, so if those places have trouble, we might not have enough food or it could cost more. The report lists six key areas around the world that are very important for the UK's safety. The government says this report will help them plan for the future to keep people safe and healthy.",
