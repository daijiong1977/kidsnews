      "title": "A New Gruffalo Book is Coming!",
      "summary": "Julia Donaldson, a famous children's author, has announced a new Gruffalo book called Gruffalo Granny. This is the third book in the series about the Gruffalo monster and his friends. The book will be released on September 10th in hardback and audio book. It took twenty years to make, and it introduces a new character, the Gruffalo's granny, while bringing back old favorites from the first two books. The author shared this news on BBC Radio 4 and said it was a challenge to write a sequel. She got the idea a long time ago but was busy with other books. Now that she is a granny herself, she felt inspired to finish it. The illustrator, Axel Scheffler, was surprised but excited to work on it. The Gruffalo books are very popular, selling over 18 million copies worldwide in many languages. They tell rhyming stories about adventures in a woodland with animals.",

      "summary": "Artist Andy Goldsworthy is making a big artwork called Gravestones in the Lowther Hills in Scotland. He is working with gravediggers from 108 cemeteries to collect stones from graveyards. The artwork will be 25 metres by 25 metres and have a wall around it. It will be filled with these stones to create a place where people can remember and celebrate loved ones they have lost. Goldsworthy says it will be a stark and simple sea of stones. He got £200,000 from a new art prize called Dent in the Universe to build it. This prize helps artists make public art for everyone to see for free. The money comes from the Hugo Burge Foundation, started by Hugo Burge who loved art.",

      "title": "A Tiny Chip That Changes and Points Light",
      "summary": "Scientists have made a very thin chip that can change invisible light into visible light and point it in different directions. This chip is called a metasurface and has tiny structures on it. When an infrared laser hits the chip, it turns the light into a green beam that can be aimed by changing how the light waves are aligned. This is like having a flat, microscopic spotlight that can shine light where you want without any moving parts. The chip is very efficient and could be used in technologies like LiDAR for self-driving cars or in communication systems. It helps solve a problem where other devices are either good at controlling light or making it strong, but not both. This new chip does both, making it a big step forward for small, powerful light devices.",

      "title": "A Superfluid Freezes and Breaks Physics Rules",
      "summary": "Scientists have discovered something amazing about a special type of matter called a superfluid. Normally, when things get very cold, they turn from a liquid into a solid, like water freezing into ice. But a superfluid, which flows without any resistance and can climb walls, usually stays moving even when it's super cold. In a new experiment, physicists cooled a superfluid made from particles in graphene, a material made of carbon atoms. They saw it suddenly stop moving and become something called a supersolid. This is like a solid that can still flow without friction, which is very strange and breaks the usual rules of physics. The team used graphene sheets and magnetic fields to create excitons, which are tiny particles that act together as a superfluid. By changing the temperature and how many excitons there were, they found that when there were fewer excitons, the superfluid stopped and turned into an insulator, but warming it up made it flow again. This discovery helps us learn more about how matter behaves in the quantum world.",

      "summary": "Jacob Elordi is an actor from Australia who is starring in a new movie called Wuthering Heights. He plays a character named Heathcliffe, and the movie is set in Yorkshire, a place in England. To sound like he is from Yorkshire, Jacob practices a Northern accent in the bath. He says he likes words like 'mek' instead of 'make'. The movie is based on a classic book by Emily Brontë. At the premiere in London, many fans came to see Jacob and his co-star Margot Robbie. The event had decorations to look like Yorkshire, and singer Charli XCX also attended. She wrote music for the film and enjoyed working on it because it was different from her usual style. The film has caused some talk because of its casting and scenes.",

      "summary": "Emma Raducanu, a famous tennis player from Britain, won her match at the Transylvania Open tournament. She beat Maja Chwalinska from Poland with scores of 6-0 and 6-4. This means she is now in the semi-finals, which is a big step toward winning the tournament. Raducanu is happy with how she played and proud of overcoming challenges during the match. She has not been in many semi-finals since she won the US Open in 2021. Next, she will play against Oleksandra Oliynykova from Ukraine, who also won her match to reach the semi-finals. Other players like Katie Boulter also won their matches to get into semi-finals at different tournaments. This article talks about tennis players working hard and trying to win.",
