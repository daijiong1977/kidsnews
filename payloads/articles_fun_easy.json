      "title": "What Happens to UK Companies After US Court Ruling?",
      "summary": "UK companies are unsure what will happen after a US court said no to some taxes called tariffs that President Trump made. The court stopped tariffs from last year, but Trump says he will make new 10% taxes on many countries, including the UK. This means UK businesses might have to pay more money when trading with the US. Experts say it is still unclear for companies. The UK government is trying to talk with the US to lower tariffs, especially on things like steel and cars. Trump is unhappy with the court's decision and promises to bring back the tariffs in another way. This creates confusion for UK firms trying to plan their business.",

      "summary": "Sam Fender and Olivia Dean have made history in the UK music charts. Their song, Rein Me In, reached number one after 35 weeks, which is the longest time any song has spent in the top 40 before becoming number one. The song is a duet about a relationship ending and was first released last June. It had been at number five three times before finally reaching the top. Sam said the song took a long time to become popular because people discovered it online over time. Olivia added a new verse from a female perspective, making the song better. They performed it together at big stadiums in London and Newcastle. This is Sam's first number one single, while Olivia has had other hits. The song replaced Taylor Swift's Opalite at number one.",

      "summary": "President Donald Trump used tariffs, which are taxes on goods from other countries, to change how the world trades. He wanted to make other countries pay more to sell things in America. But the Supreme Court, the highest court in the U.S., said he could not use emergency powers for some of these tariffs. This means some tariffs are now lower, but not all of them. Tariffs can make things more expensive, but importers have found ways to avoid high costs. The president might try other ways to keep tariffs high. This affects trade with countries like China and Europe.",

      "summary": "In 2025, Taylor Swift and KPop stars were the biggest music hits. Taylor Swift's album 'The Life of a Showgirl' sold the most copies worldwide. Rosé from Blackpink had the top song 'APT' with Bruno Mars, which got over two billion streams. This song has some Korean words and is the first non-English song to be number one globally. Another KPop group, Huntr/x, had the second biggest song 'Golden'. The IFPI, a music group, made these charts.
