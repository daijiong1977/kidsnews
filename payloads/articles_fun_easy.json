      "title": "Virgin Media Fined for Not Helping People in Need",
      "summary": "Virgin Media, a big phone company, got a huge fine of £24 million because it did not protect some customers during a change to new phone lines. These customers use special alarms called telecare to call for help in emergencies, like if they fall or feel sick. The alarms work through landlines, and when Virgin Media switched to digital lines, many alarms stopped working. This left elderly and disabled people without a way to get help quickly, which could be very dangerous. The company did not make sure these customers were safe during the change. A group called Ofcom, which watches over phone companies, gave the fine to teach Virgin Media and other companies to be more careful with vulnerable people. Virgin Media said it is now making things better for customers.",

      "summary": "A Japanese singer named Maki Otsuki was performing a song from the popular anime 'One Piece' at a music festival in Shanghai, China, when suddenly the lights and music went off. She was quickly taken off stage by crew members. This happened because there are tensions between China and Japan over political issues, like comments made by Japan's leader about Taiwan. China sees Taiwan as part of its country and doesn't want others to interfere. Other Japanese music events in Shanghai were also canceled, including a concert by pop star Ayumi Hamasaki, which left fans upset and calling the actions rude. The cancellations are linked to these disagreements, affecting cultural exchanges and daily life in both countries.",

      "summary": "A big waste company says vapes are still causing fires in their trucks and places where they handle trash, even though disposable vapes were banned six months ago. Vapes have batteries that can catch fire if they get crushed. The company has seen over 300 fires this year, which is more than one a day. This puts workers in danger and costs a lot of money. People should not throw vapes in regular trash or recycling bins. Instead, they should use special bins at shops or recycling centers. Some people are using reusable vapes like disposable ones and throwing them away too soon. The ban was meant to stop kids from buying vapes and reduce litter, but it hasn't fixed the fire problem completely. Companies want better recycling plans to keep everyone safe.",

He was a journalist who worked at big newspapers like the Financial Times and The Daily Telegraph before creating The Independent in 1986 with friends.

      "summary": "Rage bait is a new word that means online content made to make people angry on purpose. Oxford University Press, which makes dictionaries, chose it as the word of the year for 2025. This word describes tricks used on social media to get more likes, shares, and comments by making users feel mad. It beat other words like aura farming and biohack. Rage bait is like clickbait, which tries to get clicks, but it focuses on making people cross. Experts say it shows how the internet is changing to play with our feelings. Last year's word was brain rot, which talked about how scrolling too much can make your mind tired. This helps us understand how online content can affect us.",
