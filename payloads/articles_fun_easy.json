      "title": "Olivia Dean Helps Fans Get Money Back from Ticket Companies",
      "summary": "Olivia Dean is a famous singer who spoke out against ticket companies like Ticketmaster and AXS. She said it was unfair that some people were selling tickets to her concerts for much more money than the original price. For example, tickets that should have cost around $70 were being sold for over $1,000. Olivia wrote a letter calling this practice disgusting and asked the companies to do better. As a result, Ticketmaster agreed to give some fans a refund for the extra money they paid and promised to limit high prices for future ticket sales. Olivia wants live music to be affordable for everyone, and she is happy that her actions are making a difference. This story shows how artists can stand up for their fans.",

      "title": "How Lasers Break Apart Tiny Football Molecules",
      "summary": "Scientists used special X-ray cameras to make movies of how strong lasers break apart a molecule called Buckminsterfullerene, which looks like a tiny soccer ball. This molecule is made of 60 carbon atoms. By shining intense laser light on it, they watched how the molecule changes and splits into pieces. This helps us learn how to control chemical reactions with light. The research was done by teams from Germany, Switzerland, the USA, and Japan using a big machine called the Linac Coherent Light Source. They found that at low laser power, the molecule expands first, and at high power, it breaks apart quickly. This work is important for understanding how atoms move in molecules.",

      "title": "A Fun Way to Recycle Teflon",
      "summary": "Scientists have found a new way to recycle Teflon, a strong plastic used in non-stick pans and other items. Teflon is hard to break down and often ends up in landfills, which can harm the environment. But researchers from Newcastle University and the University of Birmingham discovered that by shaking Teflon with sodium metal at room temperature, they can turn it into useful materials like sodium fluoride, which is in toothpaste. This method is clean and doesn't use harmful chemicals, helping to reduce waste and protect our planet. It's exciting because it makes recycling easier and turns old Teflon into something new and valuable.",
