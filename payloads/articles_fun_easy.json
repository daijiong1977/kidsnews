      "title": "What Mormons Think About a TV Show",
      "summary": "This article talks about a TV show called The Secret Lives of Mormon Wives. It is a reality show that follows women in Utah who are part of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, also called Mormons. The show has themes like infidelity and divorce, which are not usually linked to Christianity. It is very popular on streaming services like Hulu and Disney+. The BBC asked Mormons in the UK what they think about the show. Some Mormons, like Ben and Olivia, watch and enjoy it. Ben says Mormons are normal people, and while bad things can happen, they try to avoid them. He feels the show does not embarrass them. The article also explains that Mormons believe in the Book of Mormon and send missionaries around the world. In the UK, there are about 185,000 Mormons, and they have a big temple in Preston.",

      "title": "Turning Paper Waste into Clean Energy",
      "summary": "Scientists have found a new way to make clean hydrogen energy using waste from paper mills. They created a special material from a plant waste called lignin, which is often thrown away or burned. This material helps speed up a reaction called oxygen evolution, which is important for splitting water into hydrogen and oxygen. Hydrogen is a clean fuel that doesn't pollute. The new catalyst, made with nickel and iron, works well and lasts a long time, making it cheaper than using expensive metals like platinum. This could help produce more hydrogen for clean energy in the future.",

      "title": "Atoms That Don't Move in Hot Metal",
      "summary": "Scientists have discovered something amazing about liquids like molten metal. When metal gets very hot and turns into a liquid, most atoms move around quickly, but some atoms stay perfectly still. These motionless atoms are stuck to a special material called graphene, which acts like a tiny stove. The scientists used a powerful microscope to watch tiny drops of metal as they cooled and turned solid. They found that the still atoms can change how the metal solidifies. If only a few atoms are stuck, crystals can grow and the metal becomes solid. But if many atoms are stuck, they block the crystals from forming, creating a strange new state of matter called a corralled supercooled liquid. This discovery helps us understand natural processes like ice formation and is important for making better materials in industries like aviation and electronics.",
