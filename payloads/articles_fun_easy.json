      "summary": "Biffy Clyro, a Scottish rock band, had to delay their US tour because of a visa problem. The tour was supposed to start in December to promote their new album Futique, but a mistake in the visa application meant the start date was wrong. Singer Simon Neil explained that the visa doesn't begin until after the tour was planned to end, making them very angry. They tried to fix it with lawyers and government officials, but nothing worked. The tour is now rescheduled for 2026, and fans can keep their tickets or get refunds. Neil apologized to fans who might have spent money on travel. This isn't the first time they've had issues in the US; in 2022, a show was canceled due to Covid. Despite this, the band is still popular and has big plans, like headlining a show in London in 2026.",

      "summary": "A leader in the UK government, Dame Caroline Dinenage, says it is not a good time to change the BBC's chairman, Samir Shah. She thinks the BBC needs stability because it has had some problems recently. For example, two top bosses left after a TV show edited a speech by Donald Trump, who is now threatening to sue the BBC. Dame Caroline believes the BBC should focus on finding new leaders and improving itself instead of making more changes at the top. She also mentioned that there is some chaos in the BBC and the board needs to work better. Shah says he wants to fix the issues and won't leave his job. This story shows how important it is for big organizations to have strong leadership during tough times.",

      "summary": "Chemists have been trying for a long time to make a special chemical reaction work with common molecules called alkyl ketones. These molecules are found in many things, like medicines, but they are hard to change. A team of scientists from Hokkaido University created a smart helper called a catalyst that uses light to make this reaction happen. They used computers to find the best helper from many options. This new method helps chemists make new medicines and other important chemicals more easily. It's like finding a key to unlock a door that was stuck for years.",

      "summary": "Scientists are close to solving a big space mystery that started over 100 years ago: where do cosmic rays come from? Cosmic rays are tiny, fast particles from space that hit Earth. A team at Michigan State University, led by Professor Shuo Zhang, studied these rays using special telescopes. They found clues that cosmic rays might come from powerful places like black holes or exploded stars. These places can make other particles called neutrinos, which pass through our bodies all the time. The research helps us learn about space and could answer questions about how galaxies form. By working together, scientists hope to find all the sources of cosmic rays soon.",
