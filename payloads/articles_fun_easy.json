      "summary": "A US judge has stopped the detention of Imran Ahmed, a British man who lives in America. Imran works to fight hate online and keep children safe on social media. The US government wanted to detain him and maybe send him back to Britain because they didn't like his work. Imran is married to an American woman and has a child, so he didn't want to leave his family. The judge said Imran can stay in the US for now while his case is heard in court. This happened after some US officials accused Imran and others of trying to make social media companies censor free speech. Imran says he won't be bullied and will keep doing his important work.",

      "summary": "Long ago, Earth was very hot and covered in molten rock, making it hard for water to exist. Scientists wondered how water survived to form our oceans today. A new study found that a mineral called bridgmanite, deep inside Earth, acted like a tiny water container. This mineral stored water as Earth cooled down. The researchers used special tools to test how much water bridgmanite could hold under extreme heat and pressure. They discovered it could trap more water than thought, helping Earth become a watery planet. This hidden water might have been key to making Earth a home for life.",

      "summary": "Sydney Sweeney is an actor who wants to make movies that can help and save people's lives. She is in two new films this year: The Housemaid and Christy. Both movies talk about domestic violence, which is when someone hurts their family at home. Sydney says this topic is common and she is careful when acting in these roles. She thinks it's important for big movies to discuss hard topics. In The Housemaid, she plays Millie, a character who works in a house. The movie is based on a popular book that many people like on TikTok. Sydney loves the book and the story. She works with other actors like Amanda Seyfried, who plays Nina. Amanda says they look alike and think similarly, which makes it fun to work together. The movie shows Nina dealing with mental health issues, which can be tough to watch but needs to be realistic. The Housemaid is like old thrillers but has a modern story about abuse.",

      "summary": "A lawmaker named Joyce Beatty is suing to stop a name change at a big arts center in Washington, D.C. The center was originally named after President John F. Kennedy, but recently, its board voted to add President Donald Trump's name to it, making it the Trump-Kennedy Center. Beatty says this change is against the law because only Congress can approve such a renaming. She tried to speak against it in a meeting but was muted. The White House defends the change, saying Trump helped the center by improving its money and building. Some people are upset, like a musician who canceled his yearly Christmas concert there because of the new name. The center has been a famous place since it was built to honor Kennedy.",
