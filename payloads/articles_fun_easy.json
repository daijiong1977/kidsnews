      "summary": "Universal Studios is planning to build a huge new theme park in the UK near Bedford. The government has approved the plan, and it could open by 2031. This park will be very big, with tall rides and lots of visitors expected. Some people are excited because it might bring fun and jobs, but others are worried about traffic and noise. For example, a local named Claudia Pixley thinks it's a bad idea because the roads are small and could get crowded. Universal says most people in the area support the park. The goal is to make it as popular as Disneyland Paris in France, which is a famous theme park. This project is a big opportunity for the UK to have more entertainment options for families.",
