      "summary": "In the UK, people who buy and sell cryptocurrency now have to share their account details with tax officials. This new rule started on January 1st. The tax body, called HMRC, wants to make sure everyone pays taxes on their crypto profits, like when they sell for more money than they bought. Cryptocurrency exchanges, which are like banks for crypto, must automatically give information about users to HMRC. This helps the government collect taxes that might have been missed before. Experts say many people haven't paid their crypto taxes, and these rules will make it harder to hide gains. HMRC hopes to get millions of pounds from this over the next few years. People who made money from crypto in the last year need to file a tax return by January 31st.",

      "summary": "Maggie O'Farrell wrote a book called Hamnet that tells a made-up story about William Shakespeare and his family. She also helped make a movie from her book. Maggie always wanted actor Paul Mescal to play Shakespeare in the movie because she saw him act in a play in Dublin and thought he was great. The movie is about how the death of Shakespeare's son, Hamnet, might have inspired his famous play Hamlet. It has an Irish feel with actress Jessie Buckley playing Shakespeare's wife, Agnes. Maggie joked that the director, Chloé Zhao, picked Irish actors without holding many auditions. Maggie grew up in Britain but visited Ireland often, which is important to her. She says there are many books about Shakespeare that people love to read.",
