      "summary": "The boss of Waterstones, a big bookstore chain, said they might sell books made by artificial intelligence (AI) if customers want them and if the books are clearly labeled as AI-created. However, he personally doesn't think this will happen soon because most AI-generated content isn't good enough to sell. AI is a computer technology that can create things like stories, and it's causing a lot of talk in the book world. Writers are worried that AI could take their jobs, but some writers use AI to help with research or editing. Waterstones uses AI for logistics, like making sure books arrive on time, but they try to keep AI books out of stores for now. The boss believes in letting store managers decide what books to feature based on their local communities. He also mentioned that many authors fear being replaced by AI, and some of their work has been used without permission to train AI tools.",
