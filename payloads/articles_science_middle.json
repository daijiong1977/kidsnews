      "title": "NASA's Renewed Push for Lunar Exploration Under Artemis",
      "summary": "NASA is advancing its space exploration efforts, with a key focus on sending astronauts around the Moon through the Artemis II mission, marking the first such journey in over five decades. This initiative is part of the broader Artemis campaign, which aims to establish a sustained human presence on the lunar surface by 2028. Under President Trump's administration, NASA has seen increased support through policies like the National Space Policy and funding from the Working Families Tax Cut Act, enabling ambitious goals. The agency has completed multiple human spaceflight and science missions, tested new experimental aircraft, and accelerated work on lunar exploration, Earth science, and Mars technologies. NASA leadership emphasizes that these achievements reflect a clear direction toward American space leadership, with plans to continue launching science missions, such as the Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope, and developing nuclear propulsion for deep space travel. The overall momentum is driven by a motivated workforce and strong partnerships.",

      "title": "Revisiting Edison's Experiment: Could Graphene Have Been Made in 1879?",
      "summary": "Chemists at Rice University conducted a study to replicate Thomas Edison's 1879 light bulb experiment, investigating whether he inadvertently produced graphene, a groundbreaking material composed of a single layer of carbon atoms. Graphene, known for its exceptional properties like strength and conductivity, has modern applications in batteries and electronics, earning its discoverers a Nobel Prize in 2010. Edison, in his quest to commercialize incandescent bulbs, experimented with various filaments, ultimately settling on carbonized bamboo for its durability. The research team, led by grad student Lucas Eddy, aimed to mass-produce graphene using simple equipment and drew inspiration from Edison's method, which involved flash Joule heating at temperatures around 2000-3000°C. They recreated the experiment with artisan bulbs featuring bamboo filaments, observing the filament transform into a lustrous silver substance. Advanced techniques like Raman spectroscopy and transmission electron microscopy confirmed the presence of turbostratic graphene in parts of the filament. While not definitive proof of Edison's production, due to his lack of detection tools, the findings highlight the potential of revisiting historical technologies with contemporary science. The authors suggest that other early inventions, such as vacuum tubes, may have similarly yielded unnoticed materials, emphasizing how innovation can stem from re-examining the past with new questions and tools.",

      "title": "Exploring EEG Technology to Restore Movement in Spinal Cord Injuries",
      "summary": "Spinal cord injuries often result in paralysis because the damage blocks neural signals between the brain and limbs, even though both remain functional. Researchers from Italy and Switzerland investigated using electroencephalography (EEG) as a noninvasive solution to bridge this gap. EEG involves wearing a cap with electrodes on the scalp to detect brain activity when a person attempts to move a paralyzed limb. The captured signals could be interpreted and sent to a spinal cord stimulator, activating nerves to produce movement. This approach aims to avoid the risks of surgically implanted electrodes, such as infections. However, EEG faces challenges in detecting signals from deeper brain areas, making it more effective for upper limbs than lower limbs. To overcome this, the team employed machine learning algorithms to analyze complex EEG data from patients attempting simple movements. Their study, published in APL Bioengineering, suggests that EEG could offer a safer alternative for restoring communication in paralyzed patients, though further development is needed to improve accuracy and applicability.",

      "title": "Soil Enhancement Reduces Locust Damage and Boosts Crop Yields in Senegal",
      "summary": "A study conducted in Senegal demonstrated that applying nitrogen fertilizer to soil can significantly reduce locust damage and double crop yields. Researchers, led by Arianne Cease from Arizona State University's Global Locust Initiative, collaborated with local farmers facing frequent outbreaks of the Senegalese grasshopper, a type of locust. The farmers planted two plots of millet: one treated with nitrogen fertilizer and one untreated. Results showed that fertilized plots had fewer locusts, less crop damage, and harvests twice as large as untreated plots. This approach offers a sustainable, community-based tool for managing migratory pests like locusts, which threaten food security by devastating crops across regions. The study, published in Scientific Reports, highlights how improving soil quality can alter locust behavior, as nutrient-poor soil tends to produce plants high in carbohydrates and low in protein, encouraging outbreaks. By addressing soil health, farmers can enhance crop resilience and reduce reliance on harmful pesticides, contributing to long-term agricultural sustainability.",

      "title": "Long-Term Health Risks Linked to Childhood ADHD Traits",
      "summary": "A comprehensive study led by researchers at University College London and the University of Liverpool reveals that children exhibiting ADHD traits at age 10 face increased risks of physical health problems and health-related disabilities by age 46. Published in JAMA Network Open, this research analyzed data from 10,930 participants in the 1970 British Cohort Study, tracking individuals from birth to middle age. ADHD traits were assessed through parent and teacher questionnaires, regardless of formal diagnosis. The findings indicate that higher childhood ADHD traits correlate with 14% higher odds of reporting two or more chronic conditions, such as migraines, back problems, cancer, epilepsy, or diabetes. ADHD, characterized by attention differences, hyperactivity, and impulsivity, can impair daily functioning in planning and time management, potentially leading to social and occupational difficulties. The study underscores that ADHD often persists into adulthood, yet support services in the UK are limited compared to other high-income countries, contributing to these health disparities. Researchers emphasize that tailored support is crucial for mitigating long-term health risks and enabling individuals with ADHD to thrive.",

      "summary": "This article provides a weekly update on the global rocket industry, highlighting both progress and challenges. In China, two rocket failures occurred within 12 hours, underscoring the difficulties in space launch reliability. Rocket Lab experienced a setback with its Neutron rocket during a key qualification test, potentially delaying its debut. Meanwhile, Australia's Gilmour Space Technologies secured $148 million in funding, aiming to develop sovereign launch capabilities and reduce reliance on foreign providers like SpaceX. In Europe, Isar Aerospace postponed its Spectrum rocket launch due to a valve issue, as the continent seeks to enhance its space sovereignty amid geopolitical tensions. Additionally, UK-based Orbex may be sold to The Exploration Company, reflecting financial pressures in the competitive launch market. The report illustrates how nations and companies are navigating technical hurdles, funding needs, and strategic alliances to advance their space programs.",
