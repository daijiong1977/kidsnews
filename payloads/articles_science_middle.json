Here’s how it works.\n\nArtificial intelligence (AI) isn't just another trend – it's a powerful force reshaping the very foundation of business operations.\n\nMuch like the internet catalyzed a global transformation decades ago, AI is now leading a new digital revolution. This wave of innovation is compelling organizations to reconsider, re-envision, and reinvent every aspect of their operational strategy.\n\nAt the forefront of this transformation within the technology sector is AI for IT operations (AIOps). It represents a seismic shift in how complex technology ecosystems are managed and maintained.\n\nAIOps isn't merely about adding AI to an existing IT infrastructure management framework; it's a sophisticated practice that integrates human expertise with the analytical power of AI, machine learning (ML), and advanced operational methodologies.\n\nAVP, global strategic alliances at NETSCOUT.\n\nThe goal is to fundamentally enhance how businesses manage their operational data, support critical human decision-making, and automate tasks that were once labor-intensive.\n\nIn years gone by, every facet of IT operations – from monitoring server health to scheduling workloads – required constant human oversight.\n\nNow, with the advent of sophisticated AIOps solutions, businesses can automate a vast range of these critical functions, freeing up human talent to focus on more strategic initiatives.\n\nSign up to the TechRadar Pro newsletter to get all the top news, opinion, features and guidance your business needs to succeed!\n\nThe primary driver for AIOps adoption is its ability to directly address the shortcomings associated with conventional IT management tools. While human expertise is invaluable in interpreting complex data, it can also lead to inaccuracies and inefficiencies, particularly when handling large-scale datasets.\n\nAIOps platforms are designed to overcome these challenges. When fed with high-quality, relevant data, an AIOps system can quickly identify opportunities to improve decision-making and automate processes across IT operations, cybersecurity, and other network domains.\n\nOne of the most significant benefits is the enhancement of application performance and security. AIOps tools sift through the noise of immense data streams to pull out the crucial insights teams need to understand precisely what is occurring across their network and in their applications.\n\nThis provides a clear, comprehensive understanding of issues like performance degradation or system outages, enabling teams to make faster and more confident decisions.",

      "title": "Rapid fault healing could rewrite earthquake physics",
      "summary": "Earthquake faults located deep within the planet can reconnect after a seismic disturbance, according to new research from the University of California, Davis. The study, published Nov. 19 in Science Advances and supported by National Science Foundation grants, introduces a new factor that could reshape how scientists interpret fault behavior linked to major earthquakes.\n\n\"We discovered that deep faults can heal themselves within hours,\" said Amanda Thomas, professor of earth and planetary sciences at UC Davis and corresponding author on the paper. \"This prompts us to reevaluate fault rheological behavior, and if we have been neglecting something very important.\"\n\nSlow Slip Events and Shifting Stress\n\nThomas, UC Davis colleague Professor James Watkins and their team investigated slow slip events, or SSEs, which resemble extremely slow earthquakes.\n\nRegular earthquakes happen when stresses that accumulate as tectonic plates grind together over centuries or millennia are suddenly released, creating intense shaking that lasts only seconds.\n\nAround 2002, Thomas said, researchers identified a different kind of seismic activity. In a slow slip event, stresses that build for months to years are relieved in movements of only a few centimeters that occur gradually over days, weeks or months.\n\nRepeating Slip in the Cascadia Subduction Zone\n\nTo better understand these deep events, the team examined seismic data from the Cascadia Subduction Zone in the Pacific Northwest, where the Juan de Fuca plate is sliding beneath the North American plate. Slow slip events here do not behave like typical earthquakes. The same fault segment can slip again within hours or days, which indicates the fault has partially regained strength and that stress has returned very quickly.\n\nThomas noted that even small tidal forces reveal how rapidly stress can rebuild. The gravitational pull of the Sun and Moon affects the Earth's crust just as it influences ocean tides. In addition, the shifting weight of seawater also applies pressure to the rocks below.\n\nThe remaining question is how the fault manages to recover so quickly.\n\nHigh-Pressure Experiments Reveal Rapid Healing\n\nWatkins, a geochemist who specializes in the behavior of minerals at high temperature and pressure, used laboratory equipment capable of simulating the conditions found deep in the crust or beneath a volcano.\n\nTo recreate the aftermath of a slow slip event, Watkins and Thomas packed powdered quartz into a silver cylinder, sealed it, and placed it under 1 Gigapascal of pressure (10,000 times atmospheric pressure) at 500 degrees Celsius.\n\n\"We're simulating what happens in the aftermath of a slow slip event,\" Watkins said. \"We cook it and look at it.\"\n\nThe researchers measured the speed of soundwaves traveling through the treated quartz, then opened the cylinders and examined the samples using electron microscopy.",

      "title": "Unraveling the Secrets of Non-Explosive Volcanoes",
      "summary": "Volcanic eruptions vary widely, from violent explosions to slow lava flows, and scientists have long been puzzled by why some gas-rich volcanoes do not erupt explosively. Traditionally, it was thought that gas bubbles in magma form only when pressure decreases during ascent, similar to opening a carbonated drink. However, this explanation fails to account for instances like Mount St. Helens and Quizapu, which occasionally produce gentle eruptions. Recent research published in Science by an international team, including experts from ETH Zurich, reveals that shear forces—caused by differential movement of magma in volcanic conduits—can also initiate bubble formation deep within the Earth. This process allows gas to escape early through merged bubbles, reducing explosivity. By studying these mechanisms, scientists aim to enhance eruption forecasting and mitigate risks to human populations, using analogies like stirring honey to illustrate complex fluid dynamics.",

      "title": "The Long-Term Heart Risks of Light Smoking Revealed",
      "summary": "A comprehensive review of multiple long-term studies has demonstrated that smoking even a small number of cigarettes daily significantly increases the risk of heart disease and premature death. Conducted by Michael Blaha and his team at Johns Hopkins, the analysis involved over 300,000 adults from 22 longitudinal studies tracked for up to 19.9 years. The findings indicate that individuals smoking two to five cigarettes per day face a 50% higher risk of heart failure and a 60% higher risk of death from any cause compared to non-smokers. Although quitting smoking reduces cardiovascular risk, with the most significant drop occurring within the first decade, former smokers may still have elevated risks for up to 30 years after stopping. This research highlights the persistent dangers of low-intensity smoking and underscores the importance of complete cessation for long-term heart health, especially as more people adopt lighter smoking habits.",

      "title": "Unlocking the Hormone-Brain Connection in Learning",
      "summary": "A recent study published in Nature Neuroscience explores how estrogen, a key hormone, influences cognitive functions such as learning and decision-making. Researchers from New York University and other institutions conducted experiments on laboratory rats to investigate this relationship. They monitored brain activity while the rats performed learning tasks that involved audio cues leading to water rewards. The findings indicate that fluctuations in estrogen levels during natural cycles cause shifts in dopamine-related brain processes. Dopamine is a neurotransmitter associated with reward and motivation, which plays a crucial role in learning. The study suggests that estrogen modulates dopamine activity, providing a biological mechanism that could explain variations in cognitive performance. This research bridges gaps in understanding how hormonal changes impact neurological health and could inform treatments for psychiatric disorders linked to estrogen, such as those affecting mood and cognition. Overall, it highlights the importance of hormones in brain function and offers new insights into the molecular basis of learning.",

      "title": "Exploiting Psychology: Louvre Theft and AI Vulnerabilities",
      "summary": "In October 2025, a theft at the Louvre Museum in Paris involved four men who stole crown jewels worth millions by disguising themselves as construction workers. They used a furniture lift and hi-vis vests to blend in, avoiding detection because people tend to overlook what appears normal. This incident highlights how human psychology relies on categorization to process information quickly. The article connects this to artificial intelligence (AI), explaining that AI systems, like those used in facial recognition, also depend on learned patterns to identify normal or suspicious behavior. However, this can lead to errors, as both humans and AI might miss threats that don't fit expected categories. Sociologist Erving Goffman's idea of 'presentation of self' is mentioned, showing how people perform roles to influence perceptions. Ultimately, the theft reveals weaknesses in security systems and raises questions about improving AI to handle unexpected situations better.",
