  "title": "Astronauts Come Home Early from Space Due to Health Problem",
  "summary": "Four astronauts had to leave the International Space Station early because one of them got sick. They landed safely back on Earth in the ocean near California. The astronauts are Mike Fincke, Zena Cardman, Kimiya Yui, and Oleg Platonov. They were supposed to stay in space for six and a half months but came home a month early. NASA said the sick astronaut is stable and doing okay. This is the first time astronauts have been evacuated from the space station for health reasons since it started in 1998. The space station is a big lab in space where scientists study how living in space affects people and plants. Now, only three astronauts are left on the station until more arrive next month.",

    "The International Space Station is a home in space where astronauts from different countries live and do experiments. It orbits Earth very fast, about 16 times a day. Astronauts train to handle small health problems, but if someone gets seriously sick, they might need to come back to Earth for help. This article talks about a rare event where astronauts had to leave early because of a medical issue."
