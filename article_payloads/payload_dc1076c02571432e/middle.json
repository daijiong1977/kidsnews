  "title": "Medical Evacuation from ISS: Astronauts Return Early Due to Health Crisis",
  "summary": "A crew of four astronauts, known as Crew-11, was evacuated from the International Space Station and returned to Earth a month early after a serious medical issue arose with one member. The astronauts—NASA's Mike Fincke and Zena Cardman, Japan's Kimiya Yui, and Russia's Oleg Platonov—splashed down safely off the California coast. NASA confirmed the affected crew member is in stable condition but did not disclose details about the illness or identity. This marks the first health-related evacuation from the ISS since its launch in 1998, highlighting the risks of long-duration space missions. The incident led to the cancellation of a planned spacewalk and reduced the station's crew to three until reinforcements arrive in February. The ISS, orbiting Earth at 250 miles altitude, conducts vital research on microgravity effects, but lacks an onboard doctor, relying on training and limited medical equipment. The early return underscores the challenges of managing health emergencies in space and the protocols in place for crew safety.",

    "The International Space Station is a multinational project involving five space agencies, including NASA and Roscosmos, serving as a microgravity laboratory for scientific research. Astronauts typically undergo rigorous training to handle medical situations, but the station's remote location poses challenges for emergency care. This evacuation incident sheds light on the protocols for health crises in space, where rapid return to Earth may be necessary. Understanding such events helps in planning future long-term missions, such as those to Mars, where medical support will be even more critical."
