  "title": "Floods and Storms Hurt Animals",
  "summary": "This winter, big floods and storms have hurt many animals. The water has destroyed nests where birds lay eggs and drowned small animals like hedgehogs and field voles. Experts say this might mean fewer butterflies and insects in spring because their eggs and babies got washed away. Seabirds like puffins have been found on beaches, and turtles have been stranded, some alive and some dead. Animals that move slowly, such as hedgehogs, are in danger because they cannot escape the rising water quickly. Rescue groups are worried because winters are getting wetter, making it hard for animals to survive. They say animals need help to find safe places during storms.",
