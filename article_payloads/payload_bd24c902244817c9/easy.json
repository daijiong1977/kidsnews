  "title": "Gwen John: The Artist Who Wanted to Be Free",
  "summary": "Gwen John was an artist who lived a long time ago in Britain. She did not want to do what people expected women to do back then. She loved painting and wanted to be free to make art. People thought she was shy and stayed home all the time, but she was actually very social and interested in others. Now, a big show of her paintings is opening in Cardiff to celebrate her 150th birthday. This exhibition brings her works together from many places for the first time. A TV show about her life has also been made. Gwen John's brother was also a famous artist, but she is becoming more well-known today. She started painting when she was young and never gave up on her dream.",

    "Gwen John was born in 1876 in Britain during a time called the Victorian era. Back then, women were often expected to stay home and not have careers. But Gwen John wanted to be an artist and worked hard at it. She painted many pictures, and though her brother was more famous when they were alive, people are now learning more about her art and life. This exhibition helps share her story with everyone."
