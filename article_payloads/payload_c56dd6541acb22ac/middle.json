  "title": "Oldest Cave Art in Indonesia Redefines Human Creativity Timeline",
  "summary": "A recent discovery in Indonesia has revealed the world's oldest known cave painting, a red hand stencil with a claw-like motif dated to at least 67,800 years ago. Found in Liang Metanduno cave on Sulawesi island, this artwork predates the previous record from Spain by about 1,100 years and challenges the long-held Eurocentric view that human creativity explosively emerged in Ice Age Europe. Researchers, including Professor Adam Brumm and Professor Maxime Aubert from Griffiths University, argue that this find supports the idea that symbolic thinking and art were innate to Homo sapiens, stretching back to our origins in Africa. The painting was created by spraying pigment around a hand pressed against the cave wall, leaving a negative outline. Over the past decade, similar discoveries in Sulawesi, such as hand stencils and narrative scenes dating back tens of thousands of years, have progressively pushed back the timeline for sophisticated image-making. This evidence suggests that early humans in Southeast Asia were engaging in abstract representation much earlier than previously thought, indicating a broader and more ancient distribution of creative behaviors. The study, published in Nature, highlights how cave art serves as a key marker for the development of language, religion, and science, showing that humans were not just reacting to their environment but actively shaping and sharing their world through symbols.",

    "This article discusses a groundbreaking archaeological find in Indonesia that reshapes our understanding of human creativity. Cave art, such as hand stencils and animal figures, has long been studied to trace the evolution of symbolic thought in Homo sapiens. Traditionally, many scholars believed that a 'creative explosion' occurred in Europe around 40,000 years ago, but recent discoveries in places like Sulawesi challenge this view. The painting described here, dated to over 67,000 years ago, uses uranium-series dating on mineral crusts to determine its age. This method involves analyzing thin layers that form over time on the art. The research, led by academics from Griffiths University, contributes to a growing body of evidence that early humans in Southeast Asia were engaging in complex artistic behaviors much earlier than previously assumed. Understanding this helps us see that creativity and abstract thinking are fundamental human traits with deep roots, influencing fields like anthropology and cognitive science."
