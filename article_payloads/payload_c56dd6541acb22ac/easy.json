  "title": "Ancient Hand Painting Shows Early Human Creativity",
  "summary": "Scientists found a very old painting of a hand in a cave on an island called Sulawesi in Indonesia. This painting is special because it is the oldest known cave art in the world, made at least 67,800 years ago. It shows a red outline of a hand that looks like a claw, which means people long ago were starting to think in creative ways. This discovery helps us learn that humans were making art and telling stories much earlier than we thought, not just in Europe but in other places too. It shows that creativity is a natural part of being human, going back to our origins in Africa. The painting was made by someone pressing their hand against a cave wall and blowing red pigment around it to leave a hand shape. This find changes what we know about when humans began to use symbols and imagination.",
