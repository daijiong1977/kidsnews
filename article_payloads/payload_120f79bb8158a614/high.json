  "title": "South Carolina Swimming Commences 2026 Season with Commanding Dual Meet Victory Over Queens",
  "summary": "The South Carolina Gamecocks initiated their 2026 swimming season with a dual meet against Queens University in Charlotte, securing comprehensive victories in both the women's and men's competitions. The women's team triumphed with a score of 181-78, while the men's team prevailed 156-104, underscoring South Carolina's roster depth and competitive prowess. Key performances included Amy Riordan's 100 backstroke win (52.69), Alexis Dalton's narrow victory in the 100 breaststroke (1:02.79 over Annika Huber's 1:02.86), and Taylor Grimley's 100 butterfly success (53.60). Additional highlights featured Emma Reiser in the 1000 freestyle (9:47.73), Breckin Gormley in the 200 butterfly (1:58.51) and 500 freestyle (4:47.03), and sprint freestyle wins by Kara West (50 free, 23.03) and Dylan Scholes (100 free, 49.65). Queens managed limited successes, such as Abigail Zboran's 200 freestyle win (1:47.29) and Nien Levy's sub-20-second 50 freestyle (19.93), but South Carolina's dominance was evident in relay events and across disciplines. The meet also included exhibition swims, like Matheus Przewalla's top 200 IM time (1:49.64), which did not impact scoring. This report highlights the strategic implications for South Carolina's season trajectory and the competitive landscape in collegiate swimming.",
