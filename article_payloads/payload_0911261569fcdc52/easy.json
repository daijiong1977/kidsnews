  "title": "A Startup Gets Money to Build Big Satellites",
  "summary": "A company called K2 has raised $250 million to build large satellites in California. K2 makes two types: Mega and Giga satellites. Their first big satellite, named Gravitas, will launch in 2026 on a Falcon 9 rocket. Gravitas will test powerful thrusters and solar arrays. The US Space Force is helping pay for this mission. K2 plans to use big rockets like Starship to send Giga satellites into space. These satellites can make a lot of power for tasks like AI and telescopes. K2 builds many parts itself to save money and make more satellites. The goal is to explore new things in space.",

    "Satellites are machines that go around Earth to help with things like communication, weather tracking, and science. Companies build them in factories and use rockets to send them into space. Some satellites are small, but K2 is making big ones to do more powerful jobs. Rockets like Falcon 9 and Starship can carry heavy loads. The US Space Force is part of the military that works on space projects. This article talks about how K2 got money to build and test new big satellites."
