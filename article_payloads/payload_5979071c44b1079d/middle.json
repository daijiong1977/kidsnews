  "Article_Structure": [
    "This article provides a comprehensive guide to the Milan-Cortina 2026 Winter Olympics, covering key points such as the scale of the event with 2,900 athletes from over 90 countries, the geographic spread across northern Italian venues, and the unique multi-ceremony opening to accommodate dispersed locations. Its purpose is to inform readers about essential details and build excitement, while also exploring Great Britain's potential for increased success. Evidence includes specific numbers and quotes from UK Sport, though it relies on official projections without independent verification. The author, likely a BBC sports journalist, has credibility through association with a reputable news source, but the article lacks detailed methodology, primarily summarizing pre-event information without original research. Overall, it serves as an engaging preview but could benefit from more critical analysis of challenges like logistical issues or environmental impacts."
