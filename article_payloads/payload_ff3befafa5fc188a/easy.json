  "title": "Mini Brains Show Brain Signals for Schizophrenia and Bipolar Disorder",
  "summary": "Scientists have grown tiny brains in a lab to study schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, which are mental health conditions that affect many people but are hard to diagnose. These mini brains, called organoids, are made from cells of patients and healthy people. Researchers looked at the electrical signals in the mini brains and found special patterns that can tell if someone has schizophrenia or bipolar disorder. This could help doctors diagnose these conditions better in the future and find the right medicines. The study used machine learning and microchips to track the brain signals, and the mini brains were about the size of a pea.",

    "Schizophrenia and bipolar disorder are mental health conditions that make it hard for people to think clearly or feel stable. Doctors often struggle to diagnose them because there are no simple tests like for other diseases. Scientists are now using mini brains grown from patient cells to study the electrical activity in the brain, hoping to find better ways to identify and treat these conditions."
