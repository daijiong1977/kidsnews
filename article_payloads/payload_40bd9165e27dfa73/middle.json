  "title": "Record-Breaking Sale: Logan Paul's Pokémon Card Auction",
  "summary": "Logan Paul, a prominent YouTuber and professional wrestler, has sold an ultra-rare Pikachu Illustrator Pokémon trading card for $16.492 million, including buyer's premium, setting a new Guinness World Record for the most expensive trading card ever sold at auction. He originally purchased the card in 2021 for $5.3 million, which was a record at that time. The card is one of only about 40 produced in 1998 as part of a contest and is the sole example graded a perfect 10 by PSA, indicating pristine condition. The buyer, venture capitalist AJ Scaramucci, plans to use it as part of a larger 'planetary treasure hunt' to acquire other rare collectibles like dinosaur fossils. The auction was facilitated by Goldin, with Ken Goldin offering incentives to Paul, and the sale highlights the booming market for Pokémon and trading cards, which have surged in value in recent years. The event was documented on YouTube and relates to Netflix's King of Collectibles series, emphasizing the cultural and financial significance of collectibles in modern entertainment.",
