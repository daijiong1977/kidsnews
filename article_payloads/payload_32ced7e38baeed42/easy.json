  "title": "How Fake Light Particles Change Superconductors",
  "summary": "Scientists have discovered that fake light particles, called virtual photons, can affect a special material called a superconductor. Superconductors are materials that let electricity flow without any resistance, but they usually need to be very cold. In this study, researchers used a material called boron nitride, which has a unique structure that creates many virtual photons even when no real light is present. They placed boron nitride on top of a superconductor made from copper and organic parts. They found that the virtual photons made the superconductor work less well, meaning it became weaker at pushing away magnets. This happens without any real light being used. The experiment helps scientists learn more about how superconductors work and how quantum mechanics, the science of tiny particles, can have strange effects. It shows that even things we can't see, like virtual photons, can change how materials behave.",

    "Superconductors are special materials that can carry electricity without any loss, but they usually need to be very cold to work. Scientists study them to make better electronics and save energy. Quantum mechanics is a branch of science that explains how very small things, like atoms and particles, behave in strange ways. Virtual photons are part of quantum mechanics—they are like ghost particles that exist only for a short time to help forces work between other particles, even though we can't see them directly. In this article, researchers used a material called boron nitride, which has a honeycomb structure, to create lots of virtual photons and see how they affect a superconductor. This helps us understand more about the invisible forces in nature."
