    "The Wiggles were formed in 1991 in Australia as part of a university project and have grown into a global phenomenon known for their educational and entertaining content for young children. They emphasize positive values and safety in their performances. Drug use, particularly ecstasy, is a serious issue as it can lead to health problems and is illegal in many places. Social media platforms like TikTok allow rapid sharing of content, but this can sometimes lead to misunderstandings or unauthorized use, highlighting the importance of digital literacy and consent in media production."
