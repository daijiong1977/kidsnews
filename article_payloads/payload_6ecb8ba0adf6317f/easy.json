  "title": "The Wiggles and a Surprising Video",
  "summary": "The Wiggles, a fun music group for kids, had a problem when two of their members were in a music video for a song called Ecstasy. The song talks about drugs, which are bad for people. The Wiggles did not know about this video and did not approve it. They quickly said they do not support drugs and asked for the video to be taken down. It was on TikTok and seen by many people before it was removed. The Wiggles want to keep their shows safe and happy for children. They explained that the video was made by a friend without their permission. This made some parents worried, but The Wiggles are fixing the issue.",

    "The Wiggles are a children's music band from Australia that started in 1991. They sing songs and perform in colorful costumes to entertain kids. Drugs are dangerous substances that can make people sick or act strangely, and it's important for children to stay away from them. Social media like TikTok lets people share videos quickly, but sometimes things are posted without permission, which can cause problems."
