  "title": "Ukraine's Peace Plan for a Safer Future",
  "summary": "Ukraine's President Zelensky has a new peace plan to stop the war with Russia. The plan has 20 points and was made with help from the United States. It suggests creating special areas called demilitarized zones or free economic zones in eastern Ukraine, where Ukrainian troops might pull back. This could help make peace by reducing fighting. Zelensky says Ukraine must still control these areas with its own police, not Russian police. The plan also includes promises from other countries like the US and NATO to protect Ukraine if Russia attacks again. Russia wants Ukraine to leave some land, but Ukraine is trying to find a solution that keeps its territory safe. The plan is an update from earlier talks, and both sides are discussing it to end the war.",

    "Ukraine is a country in Europe that has been at war with Russia since 2014. Russia took control of some areas in eastern Ukraine, and fighting has caused many problems. A peace plan is a way for countries to agree to stop fighting and live peacefully. Demilitarized zones are used in wars to create safe areas without soldiers. Free economic zones help countries trade and grow their economies. The United States and other countries often help in peace talks to support Ukraine's safety."
