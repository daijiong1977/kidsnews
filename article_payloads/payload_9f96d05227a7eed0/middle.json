  "title": "Zelensky's Updated Peace Plan: Demilitarized Zones and Territorial Compromises",
  "summary": "Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has detailed an updated 20-point peace plan, developed with US negotiators, aimed at ending the ongoing conflict with Russia. The plan proposes the establishment of demilitarized zones or free economic zones in eastern Ukraine's Donetsk region, where Ukrainian troops might withdraw to reduce hostilities. Zelensky emphasizes that any such zones must remain under Ukrainian administration and policing, rejecting Russian control. The plan includes security guarantees from the US, NATO, and European allies, promising a coordinated military response if Russia invades again. This update revises an earlier 28-point document and addresses Russia's demand for Ukrainian withdrawal from nearly a quarter of Donetsk territory. Zelensky suggests that if Ukraine pulls back its heavy forces by distances like 5-40 km to create these zones, Russia should reciprocate. However, consensus with American negotiators has not been fully reached, and Russian President Vladimir Putin has threatened further military action if troops do not withdraw. The plan reflects ongoing diplomatic efforts, including recent talks in Berlin and Miami, to find a peaceful resolution while safeguarding Ukrainian sovereignty.",

    "The conflict between Ukraine and Russia began in 2014 when Russia annexed Crimea and supported separatists in eastern Ukraine, leading to ongoing warfare in regions like Donetsk. Peace plans involve complex negotiations over territory, security, and sovereignty. Demilitarized zones are common in conflict resolution to de-escalate violence, while free economic zones aim to foster cooperation through trade. The US and European allies have been involved in mediating talks, with security guarantees being crucial for Ukraine's defense against future aggression. Understanding these concepts helps analyze the geopolitical stakes and the difficulties in achieving a lasting peace."
