    "This article is about a legal fight between the BBC and Donald Trump. The BBC made a documentary that included a speech by Trump. Trump says the BBC edited the speech to make him look bad and is suing for money. The BBC says it will fight back because it believes it did nothing wrong. This is important because it shows how big companies and famous people can disagree in court. It also teaches about freedom of speech and how TV shows can affect people's opinions."
