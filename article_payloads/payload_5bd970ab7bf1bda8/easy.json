  "title": "A Leader Warns About Money Problems",
  "summary": "Janet Yellen, a former leader in money matters for the U.S., says that President Trump is trying to scare the Federal Reserve. The Federal Reserve is a group that decides things like interest rates to help the economy stay strong. Yellen thinks Trump wants to control these decisions to get lower interest rates, which could make prices go up too fast. She explains that interest rates affect how much money the government pays on its debt and how people save or spend. This intimidation might hurt the economy by making it unstable. Yellen believes the Fed should be independent to do its job properly without pressure from politicians. She warns that if leaders interfere, it could lead to bad economic outcomes for everyone.",

    "The Federal Reserve, often called the Fed, is like a bank for the country that helps keep the economy healthy by setting interest rates. Interest rates affect how much it costs to borrow money for things like houses or cars, and how much people earn from savings. When leaders try to pressure the Fed, it can make it hard for them to do their job fairly, which might lead to problems like high prices or a weak economy. Janet Yellen has experience as a leader in money matters and wants to protect the Fed's independence."
