  "title": "Yellen Warns of Political Pressure on Federal Reserve",
  "summary": "In an interview, former Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen expresses concern that President Trump is using intimidation tactics against Federal Reserve leadership to influence monetary policy decisions. She argues that this investigation by the Justice Department is not based on valid grounds but aims to scare Fed officials into lowering interest rates to align with Trump's desires. Yellen explains that Trump has been openly critical of the Fed's policies, wanting lower rates despite inflation being above the 2% target and the labor market remaining strong with low unemployment. She highlights that lower interest rates could reduce the government's debt payments on its $38 trillion debt but might undermine economic stability. Yellen emphasizes the importance of Fed independence to make objective decisions free from political interference, warning that such pressure could lead to poor economic outcomes and threaten the nation's financial health.",

    "The Federal Reserve, established in 1913, is the central bank of the United States responsible for monetary policy, including setting interest rates to manage inflation and employment. Janet Yellen served as Fed Chair from 2014 to 2018 and later as Treasury Secretary, giving her expertise in economic governance. Political pressure on central banks can undermine their credibility and lead to decisions that prioritize short-term gains over long-term stability, as seen in historical cases like hyperinflation in other countries. Understanding Fed independence is crucial for maintaining trust in financial systems and preventing economic crises."

    "This article analyzes Janet Yellen's warning about political intimidation of the Federal Reserve. Main Points: Yellen argues that Trump's criticism and a Justice Department probe aim to control monetary policy for lower interest rates, threatening economic stability. Purpose: To highlight risks to Fed independence and advocate for objective decision-making. Evidence Evaluation: Yellen cites Trump's public statements and economic data like inflation and unemployment, but relies on her opinion without statistical proof. Author Credibility: Yellen is a former Fed Chair and Treasury Secretary, offering high expertise but potential bias as a Democratic appointee. Methodology: Based on an interview with The New York Times, presenting qualitative analysis rather than empirical research."
