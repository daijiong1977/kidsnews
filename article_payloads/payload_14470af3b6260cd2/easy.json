  "title": "How Head Hits Can Hurt the Brain's Cleaning System",
  "summary": "Scientists studied boxers and fighters who get hit in the head a lot. They found that repeated head impacts can weaken the brain's cleanup system, called the glymphatic system. This system helps remove waste from the brain, like a garbage disposal. Using special MRI scans, researchers saw that in fighters with memory problems, the cleanup system worked too hard at first but then got worse over time. This can lead to a buildup of harmful proteins linked to diseases like Alzheimer's. The study shows that protecting the head in sports is important to keep the brain healthy and prevent long-term damage.",

    "The brain has a special system called the glymphatic system that acts like a cleanup crew, removing waste to keep the brain healthy. When people play sports like boxing and get hit in the head many times, it can damage this system. Over time, this might cause problems with thinking and memory, and even lead to serious diseases. Scientists use MRI machines to study this without surgery, helping us understand how to protect athletes and others from head injuries."
