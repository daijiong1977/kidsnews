  "title": "Carlos Alcaraz Achieves Career Grand Slam with Australian Open Victory",
  "summary": "Carlos Alcaraz made tennis history by winning the Australian Open final against Novak Djokovic, becoming the youngest male player at 22 years and 272 days to complete a career Grand Slam. This means he has now won all four major tennis tournaments: Australian Open, French Open, Wimbledon, and US Open. After his 2-6, 6-2, 6-3, 7-5 victory, Alcaraz celebrated by writing 'Job finished - 4/4 complete' on a TV camera lens, symbolizing his accomplishment. He collapsed on the court in exhaustion and joy, with fellow Spaniard Rafael Nadal watching from the stands. Alcaraz commemorates his Grand Slam wins with tattoos and plans a kangaroo tattoo for this Melbourne victory. Reflecting on his success, he emphasizes the importance of enjoying every moment in tennis, not just winning trophies. This tournament was notable as it was his first Grand Slam without long-time coach Juan Carlos Ferrero, yet he performed impressively, showing resilience and focus.",
