  "title": "The Big Bill for the Covid Inquiry",
  "summary": "The government has spent over £100 million to help with the Covid inquiry, which is looking into what happened during the pandemic. This money is on top of the £192 million the inquiry itself costs, making the total much higher than expected. The government uses this money for lawyers and staff to gather evidence. Some people, like the TaxPayers' Alliance, think it's a waste, while others, like families who lost loved ones, say it's important but should be done more efficiently. The inquiry started in 2022 and won't finish until 2027, with many parts still to be completed. It's one of the most expensive inquiries ever, and there have been arguments about sharing information, like when the government didn't want to give up messages from Boris Johnson.",

    "The Covid inquiry is a big investigation in the UK to learn what happened during the Covid-19 pandemic, which started in 2020. It looks at how the government and others responded to keep people safe. Public inquiries like this help make sure mistakes aren't repeated in the future. The cost includes money for lawyers and staff to collect evidence, and it's paid by taxpayers. Some people argue about whether it's worth the money or if it could be done cheaper."
