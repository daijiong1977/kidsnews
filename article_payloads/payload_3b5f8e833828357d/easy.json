  "title": "Vapes Still Causing Fires After Ban",
  "summary": "A big waste company says vapes are still causing fires in their trucks and places where they handle trash, even though disposable vapes were banned six months ago. Vapes have batteries that can catch fire if they get crushed. The company has seen over 300 fires this year, which is more than one a day. This puts workers in danger and costs a lot of money. People should not throw vapes in regular trash or recycling bins. Instead, they should use special bins at shops or recycling centers. Some people are using reusable vapes like disposable ones and throwing them away too soon. The ban was meant to stop kids from buying vapes and reduce litter, but it hasn't fixed the fire problem completely. Companies want better recycling plans to keep everyone safe.",

    "Vapes are small electronic devices that people use to inhale vapor, often with flavors or nicotine. They contain lithium batteries, which are powerful but can be dangerous if damaged. In the UK, disposable vapes were banned to reduce litter and protect children, but many are still being thrown away incorrectly. This causes fires in waste trucks and facilities, risking workers' safety and costing money. Recycling vapes properly helps prevent these problems and keeps the environment cleaner."
