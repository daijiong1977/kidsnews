  "title": "The Happy Slam: A Fun Tennis Party",
  "summary": "The Australian Open is a big tennis tournament that players love, called the 'Happy Slam' by Roger Federer. It has grown into a huge festival with lots of fun activities like music concerts and special events, making it like a tennis version of Glastonbury. This year, it added new things like the One Point Slam to attract more people. However, some problems have come up, such as too many cameras watching players and crowds that might not care about tennis. With the leader of the tournament possibly leaving, people are wondering what will happen next. The event used to be quiet before the matches but now has star players and shows every day, turning it into a three-week party. This mix of sports and entertainment brings in big crowds and money, but it also raises questions about keeping the focus on tennis.",
