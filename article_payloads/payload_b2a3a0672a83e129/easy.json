  "title": "Asahi's Big Computer Problem",
  "summary": "Asahi, a big beer company in Japan, had a computer attack in September. Hackers broke into their computers and might have taken information from over 1.5 million customers. This includes names, addresses, and phone numbers. The attack made it hard for Asahi to work, so employees had to use pen and paper. Asahi is telling people who might be affected and is working to fix the problem. They said no credit card information was stolen. The company is focusing on this instead of sharing their money results right now.",
