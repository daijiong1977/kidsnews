  "title": "Asahi's Data Breach: A Cybersecurity Crisis",
  "summary": "Asahi, a major Japanese beer producer, disclosed a significant cyber-attack in September that may have exposed the personal details of over 1.5 million customers. The ransomware attack disrupted the company's operations, forcing employees to resort to manual methods like pen and paper for orders. Asahi's investigation revealed that hackers infiltrated their network, encrypted data, and deployed ransomware, potentially leaking names, genders, addresses, and contact information. Additionally, data from employees, their families, and external contacts were at risk, though credit card information was not involved. The company has delayed its financial results to address the incident and is notifying affected individuals. While the attack is limited to systems in Japan, and no evidence of data release has been confirmed, the event highlights vulnerabilities in corporate cybersecurity.",
