  "title": "Venezuela Lets Some Prisoners Go Home",
  "summary": "In Venezuela, some people who were in prison are being let go. This started after the government said it wanted to show kindness and peace. Families waited outside prisons for days, hoping to see their loved ones come out. One young man named Diógenes Angulo was freed after being in prison for over a year. He was arrested when he was 17 for sharing a video of a protest. Now he is 19 and happy to be with his family again. The government has not said how many prisoners will be released, but a group that helps prisoners says only 16 have been freed so far, while over 800 are still in jail. Some of the prisoners are people who disagreed with the government, like activists and journalists. The U.S. president said this happened because America asked for it. This is a big event in Venezuela as families hope for more releases.",
