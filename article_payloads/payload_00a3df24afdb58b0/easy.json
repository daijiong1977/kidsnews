  "title": "A Big Island Problem for World Leaders",
  "summary": "World leaders met in Paris to talk about peace in Ukraine. They wanted to keep the United States involved. But there was a big problem: Greenland. Greenland is a huge island that belongs to Denmark. U.S. President Donald Trump says he wants Greenland for U.S. safety. Denmark's leader was at the meeting. She is friends with many European countries and the UK. These countries do not want to make Trump angry. They said that security in the Arctic should be a team effort with NATO, including the U.S., and that Denmark and Greenland should decide about themselves. But the White House quickly said no. They are thinking about ways to get Greenland, like buying it or using the military. This scared European leaders because Trump had just sent troops to Venezuela. Now, they are taking Trump's Greenland idea seriously and are very worried.",

    "This article is about a meeting in Paris where leaders from Europe and the U.S. talked about making peace in Ukraine, a country fighting a war. But they also had to deal with a surprise problem: U.S. President Donald Trump wants Greenland, a big island owned by Denmark. Greenland is in the Arctic, and Trump thinks it is important for U.S. safety. European leaders, including Denmark's prime minister, are friends with each other and do not want to upset Trump, but they also want to protect Greenland's independence. The White House said they might buy Greenland or use the military, which scared leaders because Trump had just used the military in another country. Now, everyone is taking this seriously and feeling nervous."
