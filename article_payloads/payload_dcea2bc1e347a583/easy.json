  "title": "EPA Changes Rules for Pipelines and Water Protection",
  "summary": "The EPA, which is a government agency that protects the environment, has made a new rule about how states and tribes can say yes or no to big projects like oil and gas pipelines. These projects need permission if they might pollute water. The old rule let states and tribes check if a project could hurt water and stop it if needed. The new rule makes it faster for companies to get permission by limiting what states and tribes can look at. Now, they can only check if the project directly puts dirty stuff into water, not other problems like blocking fish or changing rivers. Some people think this is good because it helps build things quicker, but others worry it might not protect water well enough. The rule is part of a law called the Clean Water Act.",

    "The Clean Water Act is a law from the 1970s that helps keep rivers, lakes, and oceans clean in the United States. It gives states and tribes the power to protect their local water from pollution caused by big projects like pipelines. This is important because clean water is needed for drinking, fishing, and playing. The EPA is in charge of making rules to follow this law. Sometimes, people disagree on how much power states should have to stop projects that might hurt the environment."
