  "title": "Flu and Doctor Strikes Worry Health Leader",
  "summary": "Health Secretary Wes Streeting is very worried about two big problems hitting hospitals in England. First, many people are getting sick with the flu, filling up hospital beds. Second, doctors called resident doctors are planning to go on strike next week, which means they won't work for five days. This could make it hard for hospitals to care for patients. The flu is spreading fast, with cases going up by more than half in one week. Experts say this flu season is bad because it's a new type of virus that people haven't seen much lately, so they have less protection. Some call it 'super flu,' but it's not more dangerous. The doctors' union might cancel the strike after asking its members. Streeting thinks the strike is timed to hurt the NHS the most. NHS officials say they can handle the flu, but it's still a big challenge.",

    "The flu is a common illness that spreads in winter. Hospitals help sick people, but when many get sick at once, it can be hard to care for everyone. Doctors sometimes go on strike to ask for better working conditions. In England, the NHS is the healthcare system that provides free medical help. Health Secretary Wes Streeting is a government official who makes decisions about health. This article talks about how flu and strikes together could cause problems for patients."
