  "title": "Microsoft's Glass Data Storage: Saving Information for 10,000 Years",
  "summary": "Microsoft has created a new way to store data using glass that can last for 10,000 years. Glass is a strong material that doesn't break down easily, making it perfect for keeping information safe for a very long time. They use special lasers to write tiny marks into the glass, which hold the data. To read the data back, they use microscopes to see these marks. This project is called Project Silica, and it can store a lot of data in a small space. It's like having a super-durable library that doesn't need electricity to keep the information safe. This could help save important things like history, science, and photos for future generations.",

    "Data storage is how we keep information safe on devices like computers. Over time, old storage methods like CDs or hard drives can break or lose data. Microsoft's new idea uses glass because it lasts much longer, up to 10,000 years, without needing power. This is important for preserving things like scientific discoveries, historical records, and family photos so people in the future can learn from them. It's like a time capsule that uses technology to protect our memories and knowledge."
