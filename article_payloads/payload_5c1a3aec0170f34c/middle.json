  "title": "Microsoft's Project Silica: Revolutionizing Long-Term Data Storage with Glass",
  "summary": "Microsoft's Project Silica introduces a groundbreaking method for archival data storage using glass, capable of preserving information for up to 10,000 years. Glass is chosen for its thermal and chemical stability, resistance to moisture, temperature changes, and electromagnetic interference, making it an ideal medium for long-term data retention without energy consumption. The system employs femtosecond lasers to etch data into glass slabs at high densities, over a Gigabit per cubic millimeter, by creating tiny features called voxels. Two primary techniques are used: one based on birefringence, where polarized light alters refraction to store multiple bits per voxel, and another varying laser energy to change refractive magnitude. Reading the data involves phase contrast microscopy to detect refractive index differences, with automated systems and convolutional neural networks interpreting images for accurate retrieval. This approach addresses challenges in archival storage by combining durability with advanced technology, potentially safeguarding critical data like historical records and scientific research for future generations.",
