  "title": "New Toothpaste from Hair Fights Cavities",
  "summary": "Scientists have discovered a new way to help our teeth stay healthy. They found that a protein called keratin, which is in our hair and skin, can fix and protect tooth enamel. Enamel is the hard outer layer of our teeth that can get cavities. This new material makes a strong layer on teeth that stops decay and makes teeth stronger. It works better than the fluoride in regular toothpaste. The toothpaste is made from hair, which is a sustainable resource, meaning we can use things that would otherwise be thrown away. Soon, you might be able to buy this toothpaste or gels to keep your teeth healthy. This discovery could change how dentists help people have better teeth by using waste to heal them.",

    "Tooth enamel is the hard surface on teeth that can get damaged by acids from food and bacteria, leading to cavities. Cavities are holes that cause pain and need fillings. Fluoride in toothpaste helps strengthen enamel, but scientists are always looking for better ways. Keratin is a natural protein that makes hair and skin strong, and now it's being used to repair teeth. Using waste like hair helps the environment by reducing trash. This new idea could mean fewer cavities and healthier smiles in the future."
