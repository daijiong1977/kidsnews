  "summary": "Birmingham City's women's football team has undergone a significant ownership change, with Shelby Companies Limited (SCL), a subsidiary of Knighthead Capital Management, acquiring a 97% stake. Knighthead is co-founded by Tom Wagner, the chairman of Birmingham City. This follows their previous takeover of the men's team in 2023. The remaining 3% is held by a group of prominent female investors, including England football legend Karen Carney, who earned 144 caps for her country and won trophies with Birmingham, and Kim Clijsters, a three-time US Open tennis champion. The club stated that this deal aims to elevate the focus on the women's team and support ambitions to compete at the highest levels in women's football. Currently, Birmingham's women's team is in Women's Super League 2, positioned for promotion back to the top flight after relegation in 2021-22. The team has a strong heritage, having won the FA Cup in 2012 and developed talents like Carney, Kerys Harrop, and Jess Carter. No immediate changes to staffing or operations are planned, but chief executive Jeremy Dale described it as a pivotal moment in the club's history, emphasizing the importance of having influential women as investors.",
