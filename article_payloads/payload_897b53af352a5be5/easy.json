  "title": "Countries Argue About Fossil Fuels at Climate Meeting",
  "summary": "At a big meeting called COP30, countries are having a big argument about fossil fuels like coal, oil, and gas. These fuels make the Earth warmer, but some countries want to keep using them. The leaders removed the words about stopping fossil fuels from an important paper. This might be a trick to get a better deal later. It's important because we need to protect our planet from climate change. Everyone is talking and trying to find a solution that helps the Earth and people.",
