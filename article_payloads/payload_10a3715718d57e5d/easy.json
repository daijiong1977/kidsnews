  "title": "The Story of a Ticket Trickster",
  "summary": "Miles Hart was a man who tricked his friends and others by selling fake tickets to the Glastonbury music festival. He told people he could get them special passes because his family owned land near the festival or worked with companies there. Many believed him and paid a lot of money, but the tickets were never real. Miles made up false invoices and emails to fool everyone. When the festival came, he disappeared, leaving people angry and in debt. The BBC talked to his old friends to learn how he did this bad thing. It shows that lying can hurt many people and it's important to be honest.",
