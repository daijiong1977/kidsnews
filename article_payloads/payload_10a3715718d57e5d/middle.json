  "title": "The Deceptive Rise and Fall of a Ticket Scammer",
  "summary": "Miles Hart, a former student at the prestigious Millfield School, built a reputation as someone who could obtain exclusive access to events, leading him to orchestrate a large-scale scam involving Glastonbury Festival tickets. He claimed his family owned land near the festival or had ties to companies there, allowing him to sell VIP passes and hospitality tickets. Over time, he expanded his operations globally, accumulating around £1 million in sales from eager buyers who missed out on official tickets. However, as the 2024 festival approached, it became clear that his offers were fraudulent, relying on fake invoices and email addresses. Miles went into hiding, leaving behind a trail of debt and broken trust. The BBC investigated by speaking to his former friends, revealing how he exploited personal relationships and the high demand for tickets. This case highlights the risks of unauthorized ticket sales and the importance of verifying sources to avoid scams.",
