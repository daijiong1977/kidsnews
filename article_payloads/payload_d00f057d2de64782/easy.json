  "title": "A Spy Leader Talks About Russia and Ukraine",
  "summary": "A leader from Britain's spy agency, MI6, named Blaise Metreweli, gave a speech about Russia's actions. She said that Russian President Vladimir Putin is not trying to end the war in Ukraine quickly. Instead, he is making peace talks take longer because he wants to control Ukraine and bother other countries in NATO. Metreweli explained that Russia is doing things like cyberattacks, drone flights near airports, and spreading false information to cause trouble without starting a big war. She called this a 'gray zone' between peace and war. Metreweli is the first woman to lead MI6 and spoke from their headquarters in London. She warned that Russia's actions are a threat to many places around the world.",
