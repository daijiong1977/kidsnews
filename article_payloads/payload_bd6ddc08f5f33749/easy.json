  "title": "A New Battery That Stores More Energy and Cleans Seawater",
  "summary": "Scientists have found a cool way to make batteries better! They are working on sodium-ion batteries, which are like the batteries in your toys but use a common material called sodium instead of expensive lithium. Researchers at the University of Surrey discovered that if they keep water inside a special battery material called sodium vanadium oxide, it works much better. This hydrated material can store almost twice as much energy, charge faster, and last for over 400 charges. It also works in salt water and can help remove salt from seawater, making fresh water. This could lead to safer, cheaper batteries for storing energy from the sun or wind and for electric cars, helping our planet.",

    "Batteries are devices that store energy to power things like phones and cars. Most batteries today use lithium, which is expensive and can harm the environment. Sodium is a cheaper and more common material found in salt. Scientists are trying to make sodium-ion batteries work as well as lithium-ion ones to help save money and protect the Earth. Water is usually removed from battery materials, but this research shows keeping it in can make batteries better and even clean seawater."
