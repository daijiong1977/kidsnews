  "title": "Tennis Players Ask for Privacy at a Big Tournament",
  "summary": "Jessica Pegula and Iga Swiatek are tennis players who spoke out at the Australian Open, a big tennis tournament. They are worried about cameras filming them when they are not playing on the court. They feel like they are being watched all the time, just like animals in a zoo. They want more privacy so they can relax and focus without cameras around. Other players, like Coco Gauff, have also said this is a problem. The players think it is important to have private time away from the game. This is about respecting athletes and giving them space to be themselves off the court.",
