  "title": "Tennis Stars Advocate for Enhanced Privacy at Major Tournaments",
  "summary": "At the Australian Open, professional tennis players Jessica Pegula and Iga Swiatek have raised concerns about the pervasive use of cameras in areas away from the competition courts, echoing earlier statements by fellow player Coco Gauff. They argue that constant surveillance infringes on their personal space, making them feel like 'animals in a zoo,' and stress the need for greater privacy to maintain mental well-being and performance focus. This issue highlights broader debates in sports about athlete rights, media intrusion, and the balance between public interest and individual dignity. The players' call for change suggests a growing awareness of the psychological impacts of media coverage, urging tournament organizers to implement stricter privacy policies. Their advocacy reflects a shift toward prioritizing athlete welfare in high-pressure environments, potentially influencing future regulations in tennis and other sports.",
