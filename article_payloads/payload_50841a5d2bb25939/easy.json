  "title": "Black Hole Twists Space Like a Spinning Top",
  "summary": "Scientists have seen something amazing in space! They watched a black hole, which is a very heavy object that pulls everything in, twist the space around it. This is called frame-dragging, like how a spinning top makes water swirl. The black hole was spinning fast and pulled on a star that got too close. The star was torn apart, and its pieces formed a disk that wobbled every 20 days. The scientists used special telescopes to see X-rays and radio waves from this event. This helps us learn more about black holes and confirms ideas from a long time ago by Einstein and other scientists. It's a big discovery because it shows how black holes can change space itself!",

    "Black holes are mysterious objects in space that are so heavy they pull everything in, including light. Scientists study them to understand how the universe works. Stars are big balls of gas that can get too close to black holes and be torn apart. Telescopes help scientists see things far away by collecting different types of light, like X-rays and radio waves. This discovery shows how black holes can twist space, which was predicted by Albert Einstein over 100 years ago."
