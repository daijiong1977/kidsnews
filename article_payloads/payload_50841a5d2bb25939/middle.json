  "title": "Observing Frame-Dragging: Black Holes Twist Spacetime in New Study",
  "summary": "Astronomers have achieved a significant breakthrough by observing Lense-Thirring precession, also known as frame-dragging, for the first time. This phenomenon occurs when a fast-spinning black hole twists the spacetime around it, causing nearby matter to wobble. The research focused on AT2020afhd, a tidal disruption event where a supermassive black hole ripped apart a star. As the star was destroyed, its remains formed an accretion disk that emitted intense jets at nearly light speed. By analyzing X-ray data from the Swift Observatory and radio signals from the VLA, scientists detected a 20-day wobble in both the disk and jets. This provides compelling evidence for frame-dragging, supporting predictions from Einstein's general relativity made over a century ago. The study, led by the Chinese Academy of Sciences and Cardiff University, offers new insights into black hole spin, accretion physics, and jet formation, while also enhancing understanding of tidal disruption events through observed signal variations.",

    "Black holes are regions in space with immense gravity that not even light can escape. They can spin rapidly, affecting spacetime through frame-dragging, a prediction of Einstein's general relativity from 1915. Tidal disruption events occur when stars venture too close to black holes, getting shredded and forming accretion disks that emit radiation. Scientists use observatories like Swift for X-rays and VLA for radio waves to study these events. This research builds on over a century of theoretical work, offering empirical evidence that advances our knowledge of astrophysics, including black hole properties and jet mechanisms."
