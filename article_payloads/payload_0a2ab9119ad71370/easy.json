  "title": "Why Ants Make Many Workers Instead of Strong Ones",
  "summary": "Scientists studied ants to learn how they build big colonies. They found that some ants make many workers with thin, soft shells instead of fewer workers with hard, strong shells. The hard shell is called a cuticle, and it protects ants from enemies and helps them stay healthy. But making a thick cuticle uses a lot of food and nutrients. By making thin shells, ants save those nutrients to make more baby ants. This helps the colony grow bigger with lots of ants working together. Even though each ant is weaker, having many ants helps the whole group survive better. This idea is like choosing between having many small toys or a few big, tough ones. The research shows how ants change to live in big groups, which can teach us about other animals and even people.",

Ants have a hard outer shell called a cuticle that keeps them safe. Scientists study ants to understand how animals work together in groups. This research helps us learn about teamwork in nature."
