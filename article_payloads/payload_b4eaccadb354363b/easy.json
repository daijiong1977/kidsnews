  "title": "Turning Gut Bacteria into Anti-Aging Helpers",
  "summary": "Scientists have found a cool way to make the tiny bacteria in animals' guts work like little factories to help them live longer. They used a special medicine called cephaloridine to tell the bacteria to make more of a helpful substance called colanic acid. This substance helps worms and flies live longer. When they tried it in mice, it made their bodies healthier by improving things like cholesterol and insulin. The medicine is safe because it stays in the gut and doesn't go into the blood, so it doesn't hurt the rest of the body. This discovery could lead to new medicines that help people live longer by working with gut bacteria instead of directly on the body.",

    "Gut bacteria are tiny organisms that live in our digestive system and help us digest food. Scientists study them to find ways to keep us healthy and live longer. In this article, they found a way to make these bacteria produce a special substance that can help animals live longer by using a safe medicine. This is exciting because it might help people in the future without causing side effects."
