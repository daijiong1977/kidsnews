  "summary": "This article talks about Jeffrey Epstein, a man who did bad things to women. He thought about investing in a music company called EMI. His friend David Stern told him that the music industry was connected to women, which Epstein called \"P.\" Stern sent emails to Epstein about this idea. Epstein was interested and asked if they needed help from someone named Mandelson. Stern was a businessman who knew important people like Prince Andrew and helped with money problems. The emails show that Stern often talked about deals and sent news about EMI's money troubles. EMI was a big music company that doesn't exist anymore. The article uses some offensive words to describe how Epstein talked about women. It is based on emails released by the US government.",
