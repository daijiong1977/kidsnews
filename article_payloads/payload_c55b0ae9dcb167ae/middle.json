  "title": "Epstein's EMI Investment Plan for Access to Women",
  "summary": "The article reveals that Jeffrey Epstein, a convicted sex offender, considered investing in the music conglomerate EMI based on suggestions from his associate David Stern. In emails released by the US Department of Justice, Stern indicated that the music industry was \"related to P,\" a term Epstein used to refer to women, implying it could offer access to them. Epstein expressed interest and inquired about involving Lord Mandelson, a UK government official. Stern, a German businessman with connections to figures like Prince Andrew and involvement in Sarah Ferguson's financial issues, frequently proposed deals to Epstein, including forwarding news about EMI's financial struggles. EMI, which included EMI Records and was later acquired by Universal Music, was described as a \"troubled industry\" by Stern. The emails also show Stern using phrases like \"lots of P\" in greetings and offering \"P factor\" ratings for events, highlighting the offensive language and potential exploitation. This suggests Epstein viewed business investments as a means to facilitate his predatory behavior, with Stern acting as an intermediary in these discussions.",
