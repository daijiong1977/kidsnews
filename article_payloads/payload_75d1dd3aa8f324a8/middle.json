  "title": "Climate Change and the Increase in UK Winter Flooding: A Scientific Perspective",
  "summary": "This article examines the trend of wetter winters and more frequent flooding in the UK, linking it to climate change. Recent months have seen record rainfall, attributed to a blocked weather pattern where high pressure over Scandinavia traps wet systems. The Met Office reports that due to global warming, extreme wet winters have shifted from once-in-80-year events to once-in-20-year occurrences, with projections suggesting further increases. Impacts are severe, affecting housing, transport, and agriculture; for instance, a Somerset farmer faces crop loss from floodwater. Over 100 flood warnings were issued, with hundreds of homes flooded. Historical data shows six of the ten wettest winters in 250 years occurred this century, aligning with predictions. The science explains that burning fossil fuels releases greenhouse gases, warming the planet. Each 1°C rise allows the atmosphere to hold 7% more moisture, intensifying rainfall. Concurrently, sea levels have risen 20cm since 1901 from ocean expansion and glacier melt, worsening coastal flooding during storms. Currently, the UK experiences about seven heavy rainfall days annually, but if global temperatures exceed 2°C above pre-industrial levels, this could rise to nine days. Despite emission reduction policies, UN projections indicate a 2.5°C increase by 2100, highlighting ongoing risks.",
