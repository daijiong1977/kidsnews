  "title": "Why Are Winters Getting Wetter and Floods Happening More?",
  "summary": "This article talks about how the UK is having very wet winters with lots of rain and flooding. In January and February, many places had record rainfall because a weather pattern got stuck, keeping the rain from moving away. Scientists say that because the Earth is getting warmer from things like burning coal and oil, wet winters that used to happen once every 80 years now happen once every 20 years. This means more floods that can damage homes, roads, and farms. For example, a farmer in Somerset worried his crops would rot in floodwater. The article explains that warmer air can hold more moisture, leading to heavier rain, and rising sea levels make coastal flooding worse. If temperatures keep rising, heavy rain days could increase from seven to nine days a year.",

    "This article is about climate change and how it affects weather in the UK. It explains that burning fossil fuels like coal and oil releases gases that warm the Earth, leading to changes in rainfall and sea levels. For elementary students, it's important to understand that our actions, like using energy, can impact the environment and cause problems like flooding. The article uses examples from farmers and homes to show real-life effects, making it easier to see why this matters. Learning about this helps us think about ways to protect our planet, such as using less energy or planting trees."
