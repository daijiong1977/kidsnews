  "title": "How Did Stonehenge's Big Rocks Get There?",
  "summary": "Scientists have been trying to figure out how the big rocks at Stonehenge in England got there for a long time. Some thought glaciers, which are huge sheets of ice, might have carried them from far away. But new research from Curtin University says that probably didn't happen. The scientists looked at tiny mineral grains in rivers near Stonehenge. They used special tools to study these grains, which are like tiny time capsules that tell stories about the past. They found no signs that glaciers ever reached Stonehenge. This means people likely moved the rocks themselves, maybe by sailing them on boats or rolling them on logs, though we don't know exactly how. The study helps solve a mystery that has puzzled experts for years, showing that humans planned and worked hard to build Stonehenge.",

    "Stonehenge is a famous ancient site in England made of large stones arranged in a circle. For many years, people have wondered how these heavy rocks got there. Some scientists thought glaciers, which are large masses of ice, might have carried them during the Ice Age. But new research suggests humans did it, showing how clever and hardworking ancient people were. This helps us understand more about history and how people built amazing things long ago."
