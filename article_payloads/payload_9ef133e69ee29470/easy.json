  "title": "People in Government Who Believe Wrong Things About Elections",
  "summary": "This article talks about how President Donald Trump, who lost the 2020 election to Joe Biden, has put many people into his government who believe his false claims that he really won. These people, like the attorney general and lawyers, are now in powerful jobs. They are using their positions to investigate the 2020 election, even though many of the claims have been checked and found untrue. For example, they took ballots from Fulton County in Georgia. Election officials are worried this might cause problems in future elections. Experts say this makes the false ideas stronger because they are now part of the government. Trump keeps saying he won, and his team helps him, which can confuse people and affect how elections work.",

    "Elections are important events where people vote to choose their leaders, like the president. In 2020, Donald Trump ran against Joe Biden, and Biden won. Some people, including Trump, said the election was not fair, but investigations showed it was. Now, Trump has put people who believe these false ideas into government jobs, which can affect how elections are run and make people doubt the results. This is a concern because fair elections are key to democracy."
