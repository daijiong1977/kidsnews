  "title": "BP Cuts Costs as Profits Go Down",
  "summary": "BP is a big oil company that makes money from selling oil. Last year, BP's profits dropped to $7.5 billion from $8.9 billion because oil prices fell by about 20%. To save money, BP is cutting costs more than before, aiming to save $5.5 billion to $6.5 billion by 2027. It also stopped buying back its own shares and is selling parts of its business. BP has a new boss named Meg O'Neill, who will be the first woman to lead a major oil company. She will focus on oil and gas instead of renewable energy. BP is doing this to pay off its $22 billion debt and make the company stronger for the future.",

    "BP is one of the world's largest oil and gas companies, providing energy for cars, homes, and businesses. Companies like BP make money by selling oil, but when oil prices drop, they earn less. To stay strong, companies sometimes cut costs by spending less money or selling parts of their business. A new boss can change a company's plans, like focusing more on oil instead of renewable energy. Debt is money a company owes, and paying it off helps the company be more secure for the future."
