  "title": "Unraveling the Cosmic Collision That Formed the Moon",
  "summary": "Approximately 4.5 billion years ago, a massive protoplanet named Theia collided with Earth, leading to the formation of the Moon and altering Earth's characteristics. Scientists have long puzzled over Theia's nature, including its size, composition, and origin in the Solar System. A recent study published in 2025 by researchers from the Max Planck Institute for Solar System Research and the University of Chicago addresses these questions by analyzing isotopic signatures in Earth and lunar rocks. Isotopes, which are variants of elements with different neutron numbers, preserve information about where planetary materials formed. The team measured iron isotopes with high precision in samples from Earth and Apollo missions, finding no significant differences between Earth and Moon isotopes for elements like iron, chromium, and zirconium. This similarity suggests that Earth and Theia likely originated in the inner Solar System. By modeling various collision scenarios, the researchers reconstructed Theia's possible composition, indicating it was a neighbor to Earth. The study highlights how isotopic analysis can reveal ancient planetary histories, even when direct evidence is lost.",

    "The formation of the Solar System began about 4.6 billion years ago from a cloud of gas and dust. Planets like Earth formed through accretion, where smaller bodies collided and merged. The giant impact hypothesis suggests that a Mars-sized protoplanet, Theia, struck Earth, ejecting material that coalesced into the Moon. Isotopic studies are crucial because isotopes vary based on where in the Solar System materials formed. For instance, inner Solar System bodies have distinct isotope ratios compared to outer ones. The Apollo missions in the 1960s and 70s provided lunar samples that revolutionized our understanding. Recent advances in precision measurement allow scientists to analyze tiny isotopic differences, helping reconstruct events like the Theia impact. This research not only explains lunar origins but also informs how planets evolve and differentiate internally."
