  "title": "The Mystery of the Moon's Birth",
  "summary": "Long ago, about 4.5 billion years, a big planet called Theia crashed into Earth. This huge crash changed Earth and made the Moon. Scientists are still trying to understand how it happened. They study rocks from Earth and the Moon to find clues. By looking at tiny parts called isotopes, they can learn about Theia. Isotopes are like different versions of elements that tell where something came from. The new study shows that Earth and Theia might have been neighbors in the inner Solar System. This helps explain why the Moon is here today and teaches us about how planets form.",

    "Long ago, the Solar System was forming with many planets. Earth was young when Theia, another planet, crashed into it. This big event made the Moon and changed Earth forever. Scientists use rocks and isotopes to study this because Theia is gone. Isotopes are special atoms that show where things came from in space. Learning about this helps us understand how our world began."
