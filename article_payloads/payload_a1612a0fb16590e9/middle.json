  "title": "Uncovering the Secrets of the King's Trough: How Earth's Forces Shape the Atlantic",
  "summary": "The King's Trough Complex, a massive underwater canyon system stretching 500 kilometers in the Atlantic Ocean, has puzzled scientists for years. Located off Portugal's coast, it includes deep trenches like Peake Deep. Recent research led by GEOMAR reveals that its formation began 37 to 24 million years ago due to tectonic plate movements. A plate boundary between Europe and Africa shifted through the area, pulling the crust apart in a zipper-like motion from east to west. Key to this process was the oceanic crust's unusual thickness and heat, caused by a mantle plume—a column of hot material rising from Earth's mantle. This weakened the crust, making it prone to fracturing. When the plate boundary moved south toward the Azores, the trough stopped forming. Scientists used high-resolution sonar from expedition M168 in 2020 to map the seafloor and collected volcanic rock samples for chemical analysis and dating. These findings highlight how deep mantle processes interact with tectonic shifts to create major seafloor features, with similar activity ongoing near the Azores at the Terceira Rift.",

    "Earth's lithosphere is divided into tectonic plates that float on the semi-fluid asthenosphere. Movements at plate boundaries, such as divergent boundaries where plates pull apart, can create rifts and trenches. Mantle plumes are upwellings of hot material from the mantle that can cause volcanic activity and alter crust properties. Oceanography involves studying seafloor features using technologies like sonar for bathymetry and sampling tools for geological analysis. The Atlantic Ocean's formation is linked to plate tectonics, with ongoing processes like seafloor spreading."
