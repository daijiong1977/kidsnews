  "title": "A Giant Underwater Canyon in the Atlantic Ocean",
  "summary": "Deep in the Atlantic Ocean, there is a huge underwater canyon called the King's Trough Complex. It is about 500 kilometers long, which is very big, and includes deep trenches and basins. Scientists wanted to know how it formed. They discovered that millions of years ago, the Earth's crust in that area was pulled apart like a zipper opening, creating cracks and rifts. This happened because the crust was weak from being heated by hot material rising from deep inside the Earth, called a mantle plume. The scientists used special tools like sonar to map the seafloor and collected rock samples to study. This helps us understand how the ocean floor changes over time.",

    "The Earth has layers like the crust, mantle, and core. The crust is the part we see, and it can move slowly over time, causing features like mountains and canyons. Underwater, there are similar features formed by these movements. Scientists study them to learn about Earth's history and how it changes."
