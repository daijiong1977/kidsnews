  "title": "Frog Eats Hornets Without Getting Hurt",
  "summary": "Scientists found a frog that can eat hornets even though hornet stings are very dangerous. This frog lives in ponds and does not get sick from the venom. Researchers tested the frog by giving it different types of hornets to eat. The frog attacked and ate the hornets, even when stung in the mouth or eyes. Most frogs survived and showed no harm. This is special because other animals, like mice, can die from one sting. The frog might have a special body that protects it from pain and poison. Scientists want to learn more about how the frog does this. They think studying this frog could help understand how animals become resistant to venom. This research was done at Kobe University in Japan.",

    "Hornets are insects that can sting and hurt animals with their venom. Frogs are amphibians that eat insects. Some animals, like birds and spiders, also eat hornets. Scientists study how animals protect themselves from venom. This research helps understand nature and could lead to new discoveries about pain and poison resistance."
