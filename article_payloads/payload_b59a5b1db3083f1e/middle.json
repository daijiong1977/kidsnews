  "title": "Venom-Resistant Frog: A Breakthrough in Animal Adaptation",
  "summary": "Researchers at Kobe University have identified a pond frog species with remarkable resistance to hornet venom, allowing it to prey on hornets despite their dangerous stings. The study, led by ecologist Shinji Sugiura, involved controlled laboratory trials where frogs were presented with three hornet species: Vespa simillima, V. analis, and V. mandarinia (Asian giant hornet). Results showed that adult frogs actively attacked and consumed hornets, with success rates of 93%, 87%, and 79% respectively, even after being stung in sensitive areas like the mouth and eyes. Unlike mice, which can die from a single sting, the frogs exhibited no noticeable harm, indicating a high level of venom tolerance. This discovery challenges previous assumptions that hornet-eating animals might avoid stings rather than withstand venom. The research suggests that frogs may have developed dual resistance to both the pain and toxicity of venom, possibly through physiological traits like proteins or barriers. Future studies aim to explore these mechanisms, positioning the frog as a model organism for understanding vertebrate venom resistance. Funded by the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science, this work highlights the potential for new insights into pain management and toxin defense in animals.",

    "Hornets are social wasps known for their painful and potentially lethal stings, which can cause tissue damage, red blood cell destruction, and cardiac issues. Animals that prey on hornets, such as some birds and spiders, have been observed, but it was unclear if they tolerate venom or avoid stings. Frogs are amphibians often studied for their ecological roles and adaptations. Previous research indicates that venom pain and lethality do not always correlate, with some insects delivering painful but non-toxic stings. This study builds on that by exploring venom resistance in vertebrates, using controlled experiments to provide evidence of tolerance. Understanding such adaptations can inform broader biological and medical research, including pain management and toxin defense mechanisms."
