The original film, a collaborative effort with seven-time Formula 1 world champion Lewis Hamilton, has garnered substantial acclaim, grossing $630 million globally and securing four Oscar nominations, including best picture. Pitt portrays Sonny Hayes, a veteran driver reentering the Formula 1 circuit with the fictional APXGP team. Despite months of speculation, including unconfirmed rumors during Apple TV's press day, Bruckheimer's statement at the Academy Awards luncheon in Los Angeles provided definitive confirmation. He withheld specific details regarding the project's timeline and casting, though he affirmed his involvement in casting decisions, leaving open the question of Pitt's return. The production distinguished itself through extensive filming during the 2023 and 2024 Formula 1 seasons, incorporating authentic race weekend footage from venues like Silverstone. Bruckheimer expressed both surprise and satisfaction at the film's awards recognition, citing challenges such as industry strikes that impacted production. Furthermore, he outlined a prolific slate of upcoming projects, including Heat 2, another Days of Thunder installment, additional Top Gun and Pirates of the Caribbean films, and a UFO-themed venture. This announcement aligns with broader industry trends, as evidenced by Apple TV's press day where Formula 1 CEO Stefano Domenicali hinted at future developments, underscoring the strategic importance of franchise expansion in contemporary cinema.",
