  "title": "Brain Clues That Warn About Alzheimer's Early",
  "summary": "Scientists in Singapore found that the brain's cleaning system can get blocked in people who might get Alzheimer's disease. These blockages are called enlarged perivascular spaces and can be seen on MRI scans, which are pictures of the brain. The study looked at nearly 1,000 people in Singapore, including those with normal thinking and those with early memory problems. This research is important because it focuses on Asian people, who are often not studied enough in Alzheimer's research. Finding these blockages early could help doctors detect Alzheimer's sooner, giving more time to help slow down symptoms like memory loss. The brain uses these spaces to remove harmful waste, and when they get clogged, it might be a warning sign for the disease.",

    "Alzheimer's disease is a common brain illness that affects memory and thinking, especially in older people. It happens when harmful proteins build up in the brain, making it hard to remember things. Doctors use tests like MRI scans to look at the brain and check for problems. Early detection means finding the disease before symptoms get bad, which can help with treatment. Studies in different countries are important because people from various backgrounds might have different risks for diseases like Alzheimer's."
