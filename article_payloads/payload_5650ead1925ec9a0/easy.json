  "title": "Chemicals in Our Daily Lives Can Hurt Good Gut Bacteria",
  "summary": "Scientists studied many human-made chemicals and found that 168 of them can harm the good bacteria in our guts. These bacteria help keep us healthy by aiding digestion and supporting our immune system. The chemicals come from things like food, water, and the environment, such as pesticides used on crops and materials in plastics. When these chemicals slow or stop the growth of gut bacteria, it can lead to health problems like stomach issues or a weaker immune system. The researchers tested over 1000 chemicals in a lab and created a computer model to predict which ones might be harmful. They want new safety tests to check if chemicals are safe for our gut bacteria too.",
