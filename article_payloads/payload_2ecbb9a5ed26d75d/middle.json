    "College swimming involves teams from universities competing in meets throughout the season. Dual meets, like this one, pit teams against each other to earn points based on event finishes. Swimmers participate in various strokes—freestyle, backstroke, breaststroke, butterfly—and distances, from sprints to longer races. Relays, such as the medley and free relays, emphasize teamwork. The scoring system awards points for top placements, encouraging depth across events. Teams like Wisconsin and UCLA are part of the NCAA, which governs college sports. Swimming requires rigorous training, technique, and strategy, with meets often held in pools like those in San Diego. Understanding event types and scoring helps appreciate team dynamics and athletic performance."
