  "title": "Watching Brain Surgery to Help Cure Alzheimer's",
  "summary": "A reporter visits a hospital to watch brain surgery and learn about Alzheimer's disease. In the operating room, doctors remove a small piece of brain from a patient with a tumor. This brain tissue is saved for research instead of being thrown away. Scientists use it to study Alzheimer's, a disease that affects memory and thinking. The reporter travels to a lab where researchers work on this living brain tissue to understand how to cure Alzheimer's. The doctors and scientists are trying to find ways to help people with this disease by studying real brain samples. It's a special gift from patients that helps in the fight against Alzheimer's.",

    "Alzheimer's disease is a condition that affects the brain, making it hard for people to remember things and think clearly. It often happens in older adults. Doctors and scientists are working to find a cure by studying how the brain works. Brain surgery is a medical procedure where doctors operate on the brain to treat problems like tumors. Research involves collecting samples, like brain tissue, to learn more and develop treatments. Patients sometimes donate tissue during surgery to help advance medical knowledge."
