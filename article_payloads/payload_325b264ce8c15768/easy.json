  "summary": "Scientists studied how eating times affect heart health. They found that stopping eating three hours before bedtime helps your heart. This means not eating late at night. People in the study did not eat less food, just ate earlier. They also turned down lights before sleep. This helped their hearts beat better and kept blood pressure lower at night. It also helped control blood sugar during the day. The study included adults who were at risk for heart problems. The researchers say timing meals with sleep is important for health. This can be an easy way to stay healthy without medicine.",
