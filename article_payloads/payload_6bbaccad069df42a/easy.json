  "title": "Space Rocks and What They're Made Of",
  "summary": "Asteroids are rocky objects in space that might have valuable metals and old materials from when the solar system formed. Scientists study them to learn about space history and see if we can use them for resources in the future. A team of scientists looked at special space rocks called carbonaceous chondrites that come from C-type asteroids. These rocks are rare and often found in deserts like the Sahara or Antarctica. By studying these rocks, scientists can figure out what asteroids are made of and if mining them for materials like metals could work. This helps plan space missions and protect Earth's environment by reducing mining here. The research was done by a group called ICE-CSIC, who used tools to measure the chemicals in the rocks. They found that asteroids could be good sources of materials, but it's tricky to collect them on a large scale.",

    "Asteroids are small, rocky bodies that orbit the sun, mostly found between Mars and Jupiter in the asteroid belt. They are leftovers from when the solar system formed billions of years ago. Some asteroids contain metals like iron and nickel, which could be useful for building things in space or on Earth. Scientists study meteorites, which are pieces of asteroids that fall to Earth, to learn more about them. Space mining is the idea of collecting materials from asteroids instead of digging them up on Earth, which might help reduce pollution and save resources. This article talks about research by scientists who looked at rare meteorites to see if asteroid mining could work in the future."
