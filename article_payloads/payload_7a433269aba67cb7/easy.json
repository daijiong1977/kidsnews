  "summary": "Scientists have found that our body clock, which tells us when to sleep and be active, might be linked to dementia. Dementia is a condition that affects memory and thinking as people get older. In a study with over 2,000 older adults, researchers used heart monitors to track daily activity. They discovered that people with weaker body clocks, meaning their sleep and activity times were less regular, were more likely to develop dementia. Also, those who were most active later in the day had a higher risk. This doesn't mean a weak body clock causes dementia, but it could be an early warning sign. The study helps doctors understand how keeping a regular schedule might protect brain health.",

    "Dementia is a condition that affects the brain, making it hard for people to remember things, think clearly, or do daily tasks as they age. It's common in older adults and can be caused by diseases like Alzheimer's. Our body clock, or circadian rhythm, is like an internal timer that helps us sleep at night and be awake during the day. It responds to light and dark and keeps our bodies on a regular schedule. When this clock is weak, our sleep and activity patterns can become irregular, which might affect our health. Scientists study these patterns to find ways to prevent health problems and keep people healthy as they grow older."
