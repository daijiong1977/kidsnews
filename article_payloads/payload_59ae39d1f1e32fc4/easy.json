  "title": "Shingles Vaccine Helps Older People Stay Healthier",
  "summary": "A shingles vaccine might help older adults age more slowly and stay healthier. Shingles is a painful rash caused by the chickenpox virus that can come back when people get older. Scientists studied over 3,800 adults aged 70 and older in the U.S. They found that those who got the shingles vaccine had slower biological aging compared to those who did not get it. Biological aging means how well the body works, not just how old someone is. The vaccine may reduce inflammation, which is linked to diseases like heart problems and memory loss. This research suggests vaccines can do more than prevent infections; they might help people age better by keeping their bodies in good shape.",
