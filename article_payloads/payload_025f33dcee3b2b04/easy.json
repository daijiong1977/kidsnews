  "title": "King Charles's Christmas Speech Wins TV Ratings",
  "summary": "On Christmas Day, King Charles's special message was the most-watched TV show in the UK. Nearly 7 million people tuned in to watch him speak from Westminster Abbey on channels like BBC and ITV. The King talked about helping neighbors and staying strong together, like during wartime. After his speech, a children's show called The Scarecrows' Wedding was next with 4.3 million viewers, based on a popular book. A dance show, Strictly Come Dancing, came third with 4.2 million viewers. Other shows like EastEnders had fewer viewers this year. The BBC had nine of the top ten shows. These numbers are from overnight ratings, which don't count people who watch later on catch-up services.",
