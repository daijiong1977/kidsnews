  "title": "Scientists Say No to a Hidden Neutrino",
  "summary": "Scientists have been looking for a special type of tiny particle called a 'sterile neutrino' for many years. This particle is different from the three known neutrinos because it does not interact with regular matter. The search started because some experiments in the past saw strange results that could not be explained with just three neutrinos. To find out more, scientists built a big experiment called MicroBooNE at Fermilab. They used beams of neutrinos and a detector filled with liquid argon to see if sterile neutrinos exist. After collecting data for five years, MicroBooNE found no evidence of sterile neutrinos. This means the earlier strange results were likely due to something else. Now, scientists are working on new experiments like DUNE to learn more about neutrinos and other mysteries in space.",

    "Neutrinos are tiny particles that come from places like the Sun. They are very hard to detect because they rarely interact with anything. Scientists have known about three types of neutrinos for a long time. Some experiments in the past showed weird results that did not match what was expected with just three neutrinos. This made scientists think there might be a fourth type called a sterile neutrino. To test this, they built the MicroBooNE experiment. It uses beams of neutrinos and a detector to see if sterile neutrinos exist. After years of work, MicroBooNE found no sign of them, so scientists are now moving on to new experiments to learn more."
