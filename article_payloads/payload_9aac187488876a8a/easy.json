  "title": "Amazon's Big Job Cuts After a Mistake",
  "summary": "Amazon, a big tech company, accidentally sent an email to workers about job cuts before telling them officially. The email said 16,000 jobs would be lost in the US, Canada, and Costa Rica to make the company stronger and faster. Amazon later confirmed this was true. They want to reduce bureaucracy, which means cutting extra layers of management. This is part of a plan that started last year. Some workers might get new jobs at Amazon, but not many, and others will get money based on how long they worked. The email was sent by mistake and quickly canceled, but it showed that employees were expecting these cuts for weeks.",

    "Amazon is a big company that started by selling books online and now sells many things. Sometimes, companies like Amazon need to change how they work, which can mean cutting jobs to save money or work better. This can be hard for workers who lose their jobs, but companies often give them money or help them find new work. Mistakes like sending an email too early can happen in big companies, causing confusion."
