  "title": "Why Shoppers Didn't Buy More on Black Friday",
  "summary": "In November, retail sales went down a little bit, which was surprising because stores had big sales for Black Friday. Usually, people buy more things during Black Friday deals, but this time, they didn't spend as much. Supermarkets sold less for four months in a row. Experts thought sales would go up by 0.4%, but they fell 0.1%. However, people have been buying more computers, clothes, and furniture in recent months. A survey showed that shoppers are feeling better about their money for Christmas, but many still plan to buy less than last year. The government also borrowed more money than expected, but it was less than last year. Some experts say uncertainty before the Budget made people hesitant to spend.",

    "This article talks about shopping and money in the UK. Black Friday is a special day after Thanksgiving when stores have big sales to get people to buy things before Christmas. Retail sales measure how much stuff is sold in stores, and when they fall, it means people aren't buying as much. Experts, like analysts, study these numbers to understand the economy. The government sometimes borrows money if it spends more than it gets from taxes, which can affect things like jobs and prices. Understanding this helps us see how shopping habits and government decisions are connected."
