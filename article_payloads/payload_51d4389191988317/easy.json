  "summary": "Billie Jean King is a famous tennis player who played a big match against Bobby Riggs in 1973. That match was called the 'Battle of the Sexes' and was watched by many people around the world. It helped women fight for equal rights in sports. Now, there is a new tennis match between Aryna Sabalenka and Nick Kyrgios, also called the 'Battle of the Sexes.' Billie Jean King says the new match is different because her match was about making social changes for women, but this one is just for fun. She hopes Sabalenka wins, but she thinks it's not the same as her important match. The new match has special rules, like a smaller court for Sabalenka, which King did not have in her match.",
