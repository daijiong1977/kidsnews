  "title": "Starmer's Leadership Crisis: Navigating Without His Chief of Staff",
  "summary": "UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer faces a dire predicament following the departure of his chief of staff, Morgan McSweeney, who has been a key political operative since Starmer's leadership bid six years ago. McSweeney played a crucial role in Starmer's journey from opposition leader to Downing Street, including during low points like the Hartlepool by-election loss and the 2024 landslide victory. Starmer is described as boiling with anger over lies from Lord Mandelson, which he fell for, and angry with himself for appointing Mandelson as ambassador to the US, a grave misjudgment. The article highlights universal acceptance of Starmer's perilous situation, with Labour MPs divided: some mourn McSweeney's loss, citing his brilliance and motivation, while others note his involvement in government foul-ups. The removal of McSweeney, who acted as a lightning conductor for blame, leaves Starmer vulnerable to future political storms. Key questions now focus on Starmer's ability to lead independently, with the coming days expected to reveal the impact of this significant change.",
