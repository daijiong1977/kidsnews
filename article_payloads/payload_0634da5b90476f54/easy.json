  "title": "Energy Bills Going Down in April",
  "summary": "In April, many families in England, Wales, and Scotland will pay less for their energy bills. The government and a group called Ofgem have made changes to lower the costs. For a typical home, the bill might drop by about £10 each month. This is because the government stopped an old program and moved some charges to taxes. However, bills are still higher than before the war in Ukraine, and people are encouraged to look for better deals to save more money. The Prime Minister says he wants to help people with their bills, but others argue that moving costs to taxes might not be fair. The exact savings depend on how much energy a family uses.",

    "Energy bills are what families pay for electricity and gas to power their homes. In the UK, a group called Ofgem sets rules to make sure energy companies charge fair prices. The government makes decisions that can affect these bills, like changing programs or taxes. Recently, bills have been high because of events like the war in Ukraine, so lowering them helps people save money. Understanding this helps see how leaders work to help with living costs."
