  "title": "My Car Was Stolen: What I Learned",
  "summary": "A person had their car stolen from outside their home. They learned that car thieves use clever tricks to steal cars without keys. One trick is called a relay attack, where thieves use equipment to copy the signal from a key fob inside the house and send it to the car to start it. Another trick is a CAN bus attack, where thieves plug a device into the car's wiring to trick it into starting. The police helped track the car a little, but it was hard to find. The person had to deal with insurance and buy a new car. They found out that many cars are stolen this way each year, and thieves use gadgets sold online. This shows how car crime is changing with new technology.",
