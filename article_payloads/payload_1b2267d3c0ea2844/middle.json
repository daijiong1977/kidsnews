  "title": "Raducanu Faces Sabalenka Challenge in Australian Open Draw",
  "summary": "Emma Raducanu, the British number one, has been drawn into a potentially difficult path at the Australian Open, with a possible third-round encounter against world number one Aryna Sabalenka. This matchup is notable because Sabalenka defeated Raducanu in straight sets during the third round of Wimbledon last year, highlighting the challenge ahead. Raducanu, seeded 28th, is competing at a major tournament as a seed for the first time since her 2022 US Open victory, but her draw pits her against the top seed early on. She will start against Thailand's Mananchaya Sawangkaew, with potential second-round opponents being Anastasia Potopova or Suzan Lamens. Meanwhile, Sabalenka begins her campaign against a French wildcard, and defending champion Madison Keys is also in the draw. In the men's section, Jannik Sinner and Carlos Alcaraz are on track for a potential final clash, while Novak Djokovic could meet Sinner in the semifinals. Raducanu has shown improvement in fitness and resilience over the past year, but consistency has been an issue since her US Open win. Facing Sabalenka again offers her an opportunity to demonstrate her capability against elite opponents, as all her Grand Slam losses last year came against top stars like Iga Swiatek and Sabalenka, who were motivated to beat her.",
