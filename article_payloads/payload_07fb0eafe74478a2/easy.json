  "title": "Why Class Bias in Arts Jobs Should Be Against the Law",
  "summary": "A new report says that treating people unfairly because they are from a working-class background should be illegal, especially in jobs like acting, music, and art. The report talked to over 300 people who work in creative jobs in places like Greater Manchester. Many of them said they faced bullying or bias because of where they came from, like being laughed at for their accent or not having enough money. Some people were not paid fairly for their work, and others had to take extra jobs to survive. The report wants the government to make class a protected characteristic, like age or gender, so everyone has a fair chance. Famous people like James Graham and Jason Manford support this idea to help working-class creatives succeed.",
