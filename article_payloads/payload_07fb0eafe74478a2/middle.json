  "title": "Addressing Class Discrimination in the Cultural Sector",
  "summary": "A recent report titled the Class Ceiling review advocates for making discrimination against working-class individuals illegal within the cultural sector, based on a survey of over 300 respondents primarily from Greater Manchester. The findings reveal that more than 50% of working-class creatives experienced harassment or bias due to their social background, including issues like being mocked for accents, not wearing designer clothing, or attending state schools. Economic challenges are significant, with only 44% earning a livable wage, leading many to take second jobs, and some being offered exposure instead of payment. The report, supported by organizations like the University of Manchester and the Co-op, calls for socioeconomic background to become the tenth protected characteristic under the 2010 Equalities Act, echoing endorsements from figures like scriptwriter James Graham and performer Jason Manford. It highlights systemic barriers such as reliance on networks for entry, low pay in early roles, and risk-averse progression, arguing that these inequalities stifle creativity and diversity in Britain's creative industries, which shape national identity.",
