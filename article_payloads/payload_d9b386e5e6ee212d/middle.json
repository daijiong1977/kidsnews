  "title": "Uncovering Roman Glassmakers' Marks Through a Simple Turn",
  "summary": "Hallie Meredith, an art history professor and glassblower at Washington State University, made a significant discovery about ancient Roman glass cage cups while studying them at the Metropolitan Museum of Art. In 2023, she turned one of these cups around and noticed abstract shapes and inscriptions on the back that had been overlooked. Previously considered mere decorations, Meredith interprets these as makers' marks used by workshops to identify their production. Her research, published in academic journals, reveals that these symbols appear on multiple vessels from the 4th to 6th centuries CE, indicating a shared system among glassworkers. She found evidence that teams of artisans, including engravers and polishers, collaborated in workshops to create these complex objects, challenging earlier theories focused solely on techniques. Meredith's hands-on experience as a glassblower informs her work, helping her understand the physical demands of glassmaking. She teaches courses where students recreate artifacts to foster empathy for ancient craftworkers. Her forthcoming book expands on these ideas, aiming to restore visibility to the social history of Roman glass production.",

    "Roman glass cage cups, known as diatreta, were luxury items produced between 300 and 500 CE, carved from single blocks of glass into delicate lattice designs. Scholars have long debated their manufacturing techniques, with theories including hand carving and blowing. Meredith's research shifts focus to the social aspects, exploring how workshops operated with teams of specialized artisans. Her work connects to broader studies in archaeology and art history, emphasizing the importance of understanding craft labor in ancient societies. This background helps contextualize her discovery of makers' marks as part of a network of Roman glassworkers."

  "Article_Structure": [
    "Main Points: Meredith discovered makers' marks on Roman glass cups by turning them, revealing symbols as workshop identifiers rather than decorations, and found evidence of team-based production in workshops. Purpose: To challenge previous scholarly focus on techniques by highlighting the social history of artisans and restore visibility to ancient craftworkers. Evidence Evaluation: Based on direct observation, analysis of tool marks and inscriptions, and comparison across multiple objects, providing strong empirical support. Author Credibility: Meredith is a professor and practicing glassblower with expertise in art history and hands-on experience, enhancing her interpretive authority. Methodology: Involved physical examination of artifacts, academic publication in journals, and integration of practical knowledge from glassblowing."
