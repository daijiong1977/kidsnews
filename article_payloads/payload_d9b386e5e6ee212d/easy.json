  "title": "A Simple Turn Shows a Secret in Old Roman Glass",
  "summary": "A professor named Hallie Meredith found a secret on ancient Roman glass cups. She was looking at these cups in a museum and turned one around. On the back, she saw shapes like diamonds and leaves that people thought were just decorations. But Meredith thinks they are marks made by the glassworkers to show which workshop made the cup. This helps us learn about the people who made the glass long ago. She studied more cups and found the same marks on many of them. This means teams of workers, not just one person, made these cups together. Meredith is a glassblower herself, so she understands how hard it is to make glass. Her discovery helps us see the hidden stories of ancient artisans.",

    "Ancient Rome was a big empire long ago where people made beautiful glass objects. Glass cups were special and hard to make because glass is hot and tricky to shape. Workers in workshops used tools to carve designs. Meredith's discovery helps us understand these workers better by looking at marks they left behind."
