  "title": "Revealing Artisanal Networks in Late Antique Roman Glass Through Epigraphic Analysis",
  "summary": "Hallie Meredith, an art history professor and practicing glassblower at Washington State University, conducted groundbreaking research on Roman glass cage cups, leading to a reinterpretation of their production contexts. While examining a private collection at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in 2023, she turned a cup and identified abstract openwork shapes and inscriptions on its reverse, previously dismissed as ornamental. Meredith posits that these functioned as makers' marks, denoting workshop affiliation rather than individual authorship, a hypothesis supported by her analysis of multiple vessels from the 4th to 6th centuries CE. Her findings, published in the Journal of Glass Studies and World Archaeology, indicate a coordinated system among glassworkers, with evidence from tool marks and unfinished pieces suggesting collaborative efforts by teams of engravers, polishers, and apprentices. This challenges longstanding scholarly debates focused narrowly on manufacturing techniques, such as carving versus blowing, by integrating social history into the discourse. Meredith's methodology combines traditional artifact examination with her experiential knowledge as a glassblower, allowing for nuanced insights into the physical demands of diatretum production. Her forthcoming monograph with Cambridge University Press expands these ideas, advocating for empathy-driven approaches in archaeology. Through her course, Experiencing Ancient Making, she employs digital tools and hands-on activities to foster deeper understanding of ancient craft labor, ultimately aiming to recuperate the identities of marginalized artisans in historical narratives.",

    "Roman glass production in late antiquity involved sophisticated techniques, with diatreta representing pinnacle achievements in luxury craftsmanship. Historical scholarship has often centered on technological debates, such as whether these vessels were carved, cast, or blown, drawing from limited archaeological evidence. Meredith's research intervenes by applying art historical and social theoretical frameworks, examining makers' marks as indicators of workshop organization and labor dynamics. This aligns with broader trends in archaeology that seek to recover marginalized voices, such as those of artisans, through material culture analysis. Her integration of experiential knowledge from glassblowing offers a novel methodological perspective, bridging gaps between theoretical study and practical understanding. This background situates her work within interdisciplinary dialogues on ancient economies, craft specialization, and the epistemology of archaeological interpretation."

  "Article_Structure": [
    "Main Points: Meredith's discovery of makers' marks reinterprets Roman glass symbols as workshop identifiers, revealing collaborative artisanal networks and challenging technical-focused theories. Purpose: To shift scholarly discourse towards social history, emphasizing the roles of artisans in late antique production and advocating for empathetic methodologies in archaeology. Evidence Evaluation: Critically assesses tool marks, inscriptions, and symbol repetition across artifacts, though limited by absence of written records, yet robust due to cross-comparative analysis. Author Credibility: Meredith holds expertise as a professor and practitioner, with publications in reputable journals, enhancing her interpretive authority despite potential biases from hands-on experience. Methodology: Combines traditional artifact examination with experiential insights from glassblowing, published in peer-reviewed sources, and applied in pedagogical contexts. Critical Assessment: Strengths include innovative integration of practical knowledge and empirical data, while limitations involve reliance on physical evidence without corroborating textual sources and potential overgeneralization from a limited sample."
