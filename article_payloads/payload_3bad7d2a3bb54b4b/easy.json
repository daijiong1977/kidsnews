  "title": "Time Moves Faster on Mars: A Fun Space Discovery",
  "summary": "Scientists have found that time on Mars goes a little faster than on Earth! This is because of gravity and how planets move. On Earth, we use clocks and satellites to keep time, but Mars has weaker gravity, so clocks there tick 477 microseconds faster each day. That's a tiny amount, but it adds up. Mars also has longer days and years than Earth. Knowing this helps future astronauts who might live on Mars, so they can navigate and communicate better. The scientists used data from Mars missions and Einstein's ideas to figure this out. This discovery is important for exploring space and making sure everyone knows what time it is on Mars.",

    "On Earth, we have a system with atomic clocks and GPS to keep time accurate. But in space, things are different. Albert Einstein discovered that time can change depending on gravity and how fast something moves. Mars is a planet with weaker gravity than Earth, so scientists wanted to find out how time passes there. They used data from Mars missions to calculate that clocks on Mars run a tiny bit faster each day. This helps future astronauts plan their trips and work together from far away."
