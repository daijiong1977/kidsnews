  "title": "Is the BBC Leader in Trouble After a Board Member Quits?",
  "summary": "A man named Banerji has left his job on the BBC board early. He was supposed to stay until the end of the year, but he quit just before other board members had to talk to politicians. This is a problem for the BBC because it has already lost its top boss and news leader. Banerji might be upset with the chair, Samir Shah, thinking he is not strong enough. Some people on the board believe the BBC is biased, while others say it is fair. This disagreement is causing trouble, and it raises questions about whether the BBC can stay trusted. The article looks at how this resignation affects Shah's leadership and the BBC's future.",
