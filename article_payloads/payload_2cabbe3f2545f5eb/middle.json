  "title": "Erika Kirk Endorses JD Vance's 2028 Presidential Ambitions at Conservative Conference",
  "summary": "Erika Kirk, the widow of Turning Point USA founder Charlie Kirk and the organization's new leader, publicly endorsed Vice President JD Vance for a potential 2028 presidential bid during the opening night of the conservative youth group's annual conference in Phoenix. She announced to the crowd that Turning Point USA would work to maintain Republican control of Congress and support Vance's election in what she described as a resounding manner. Vance, who was close with Charlie Kirk and benefited from his backing in his political rise, is scheduled to speak at the conference on its final day. The event has featured typical energy but also internal conflicts among conservative commentators following Charlie Kirk's assassination in September. As Trump's vice president, Vance is positioned to inherit the Trump movement, but faces challenges in uniting a coalition built on personal loyalty amid public skirmishes within the conservative movement over the party's future direction.",
