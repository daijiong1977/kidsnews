  "title": "A Leader Supports a Future President",
  "summary": "Erika Kirk, who leads a group called Turning Point USA, said she wants JD Vance to be president in 2028. She spoke at a big meeting of the group in Phoenix. JD Vance is the vice president now and was a friend of her husband, Charlie Kirk, who started Turning Point USA but died last year. Erika Kirk told people at the meeting that her group will help Republicans win elections and get JD Vance elected. JD Vance will talk at the meeting too. The article says JD Vance might have a hard time keeping everyone together if he runs for president because some people in the group are arguing with each other after Charlie Kirk's death.",
