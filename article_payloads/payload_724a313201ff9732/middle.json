  "title": "Global Central Bankers Unite in Support of Fed Chair Amid Investigation",
  "summary": "Central bank chiefs from major economies, including the Bank of England, European Central Bank, and Bank of Canada, have issued a joint statement expressing full solidarity with Jerome Powell, chair of the US Federal Reserve. This support comes as Powell faces a criminal investigation by the US Department of Justice related to his testimony on Federal Reserve building renovations. The investigation has intensified amid ongoing criticism from former President Donald Trump, who has attacked Powell's interest rate decisions and made personal insults. The global bankers praised Powell's integrity and commitment to public interest, highlighting that central bank independence is crucial for price stability and economic health. Powell has recently defended this independence, warning that political pressure could undermine evidence-based monetary policy. With Powell set to step down in May, Trump is expected to nominate a successor, but Senator Thom Tillis has vowed to oppose any nominations until the investigation is resolved. This situation underscores the tension between political influence and the autonomous role of central banks in managing economies.",

    "Central banks, such as the Federal Reserve in the US, play a critical role in national economies by setting monetary policy, primarily through interest rates, to control inflation and promote growth. Independence from political interference is a key principle, allowing decisions based on economic data rather than short-term political goals. Jerome Powell, appointed by President Trump in 2017, leads the Fed and has faced scrutiny over his tenure, including an investigation into his congressional testimony. This article highlights how global central bankers are rallying behind Powell to defend this independence, amid tensions with Trump, who has frequently criticized Fed policies. Understanding this context helps grasp the broader implications for financial stability and governance in democratic systems."
