  "title": "World Bank Leaders Support US Fed Chair Powell",
  "summary": "Central bank leaders from around the world have come together to show their support for Jerome Powell, the head of the US Federal Reserve. Powell is facing a criminal investigation by the US Department of Justice, which is looking into his testimony about building renovations. President Donald Trump has criticized Powell many times, calling him names and disagreeing with his decisions on interest rates. The global bankers say Powell is a respected colleague who works with integrity. They believe it is very important for central banks to be independent, meaning they can make decisions without political pressure. Powell has warned that this independence is at risk. He is set to leave his job in May, and Trump will choose a new leader soon. A senator says he will not support any new nominees until the investigation is finished.",

    "Central banks are important institutions that help control a country's economy by setting interest rates, which affect how much it costs to borrow money. Independence means they can make decisions based on economic facts, not politics, to keep prices stable and help people. In the US, the Federal Reserve is the central bank, and its chair, like Jerome Powell, leads it. Sometimes, leaders like presidents might disagree with these decisions, which can cause conflicts. This article shows how world bankers are standing together to support Powell during a tough time with an investigation and criticism."
