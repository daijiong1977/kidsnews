  "title": "A Fruit Gets a Gene Makeover",
  "summary": "Scientists are using a special tool called CRISPR to change a fruit called goldenberry. Goldenberries are small fruits that taste sweet and tart, and they are related to tomatoes. They are hard to grow on big farms because the plants are too big and messy. By editing the genes, scientists made the plants smaller, about 35% shorter, so they are easier to take care of and can be planted closer together. This helps farmers grow more goldenberries. The scientists also tasted many goldenberries to make sure they still taste good. They hope this will make goldenberries easier to farm in places like the U.S. and around the world, giving people more food options, especially as the climate changes and more people need food. This tool could also help make other crops stronger against diseases and dry weather.",

    "Goldenberries are fruits that grow in South America and are becoming popular because they are healthy and taste good. Farmers have been improving crops for thousands of years by picking the best seeds, but this takes a long time. Scientists at Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory are using CRISPR, a new tool, to make changes faster. This helps make plants like goldenberries easier to grow, which is important as the world's population grows and the climate changes, so we can have enough food for everyone."
