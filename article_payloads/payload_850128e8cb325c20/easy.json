  "title": "A Big Newspaper Deal in the UK",
  "summary": "The company that owns the Daily Mail newspaper has agreed to buy another newspaper called the Daily Telegraph for £500 million. This means the Daily Mail's publisher, DMGT, wants to add the Telegraph to its group of media companies. The deal needs approval from the government's Culture Secretary to make sure it is fair and in the public interest. The Telegraph has had uncertain ownership for over two years, and this purchase could bring stability. DMGT's chairman says he respects the Telegraph and will keep it independent while helping it grow. This is important because newspapers help share news and ideas in society.",
