  "title": "Big Newspaper Company Buys Another Newspaper",
  "summary": "A company called Daily Mail and General Trust, which publishes the Daily Mail newspaper, has agreed to buy the Daily Telegraph and Sunday Telegraph for £500 million. This means they will own these famous newspapers. The deal needs to be approved by the Culture Secretary in the UK to make sure it is good for the public. The chairman of DMGT said he really likes the Telegraph and wants to help it grow into a global brand, while keeping it independent from their other papers. Some people are worried that having too few companies own many newspapers might not be fair for competition. The companies hope the deal will be done quickly.",

    "Newspapers are important for sharing news and opinions. Companies like Daily Mail and General Trust own many media outlets. When one company buys another, it can affect what news people read. In the UK, the government checks big deals to protect public interest and ensure fair competition. This helps keep the media diverse and trustworthy."
