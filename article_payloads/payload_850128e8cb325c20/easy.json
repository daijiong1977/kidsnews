  "title": "Newspaper Company Buys Another Newspaper",
  "summary": "The company that owns the Daily Mail newspaper has agreed to buy the Daily Telegraph and Sunday Telegraph newspapers for £500 million. This means the Daily Mail and General Trust (DMGT) will add the Telegraph to its group of media companies. The deal needs approval from the government's Culture Secretary, Lisa Nandy, to make sure it is fair and in the public interest. The Telegraph has been in a uncertain situation for over two years because of previous ownership issues. DMGT's chairman says he respects the Telegraph and wants to invest in it, keeping it independent from their other papers. This purchase could help the Telegraph grow into a global brand.",

    "Newspapers are important for sharing news and information. Companies like DMGT own multiple newspapers to reach more readers. When one company buys another, the government checks if it's good for the public to ensure fair competition and avoid too much control by one group. The Telegraph is a famous British newspaper with a long history, and this deal aims to give it stability and help it grow."
