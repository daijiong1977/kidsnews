  "title": "The Story of THC Drinks and Snacks Ban",
  "summary": "The government is planning to stop the sale of drinks and snacks that have THC, a substance from hemp that can make people feel high. This ban is part of a new law and will start in 2026. Companies like Indeed Brewing make these products, which have helped them when beer sales went down. Hemp is a plant similar to marijuana but with less THC. The law from 2018 allowed hemp farming, but it had a loophole that let companies create strong THC products. These items are sold in many places, even to kids, and have caused some health problems. The industry is worried and trying to fight the ban to protect jobs and products people enjoy.",

    "THC is a part of cannabis plants that can affect how people feel. Hemp is a type of cannabis with very little THC, used for things like clothing and food. In 2018, the U.S. government made it legal to grow hemp to help farmers. But companies found a way to make strong THC from hemp, leading to products like drinks and snacks that are sold in many stores. Now, the government wants to ban these because they can be harmful, especially to children. This ban could hurt businesses that rely on selling these items."
