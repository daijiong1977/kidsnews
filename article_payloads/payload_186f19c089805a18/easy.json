  "summary": "In 2026, people are focusing more on feeling good and staying healthy in new ways. Instead of always working hard at the gym, experts say it's important to take rest days to let your body recover. Smartwatches help by tracking your heart and movement, telling you when to rest. A new idea called JOMO, which means Joy Of Missing Out, is becoming popular. It encourages people to enjoy not doing everything and feel happy about taking breaks. This is different from FOMO, which is the Fear Of Missing Out. People are also using supplements like magnesium and creatine to boost their health. The wellbeing industry is growing, with many trying to improve their lives through these methods.",
