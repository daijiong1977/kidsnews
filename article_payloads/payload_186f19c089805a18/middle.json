  "title": "Wellbeing Trends in 2026: Emphasizing Recovery and Mindful Living",
  "summary": "In 2026, the wellbeing industry is shifting its focus from intense physical training to recovery and mental wellness. Experts predict that this year will prioritize rest days, supported by technology like smartwatches that monitor heart rate and movement to optimize fitness. A key trend is the rise of JOMO (Joy Of Missing Out), which encourages people to find happiness in disconnecting and taking breaks, contrasting with the earlier concept of FOMO (Fear Of Missing Out). This change reflects a broader move towards smarter, data-driven approaches to health, where understanding one's body leads to better self-care. Additionally, supplements such as magnesium and creatine continue to be popular for enhancing physical performance. The article highlights how these trends are part of a multi-trillion pound industry aimed at improving overall wellbeing through balanced lifestyles and technological advancements.",
