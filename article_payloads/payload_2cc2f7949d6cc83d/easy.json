  "title": "Banks Help People Invest Money Safely",
  "summary": "Banks and other financial companies are starting a new program in April to help people invest their money. This program is approved by a regulator called the FCA. It will give suggestions on how to invest based on what groups of similar people do, but it is not personalized advice that costs money. Many people ask friends or social media for financial help, but this new help aims to make investing easier and safer. Investing can help money grow, but it has risks because the value can go down. The program is for people who have savings and want to learn about options without paying fees. It is meant to build confidence and provide better support for making financial decisions.",
