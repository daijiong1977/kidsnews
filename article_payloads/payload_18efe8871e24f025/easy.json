  "title": "Do Winter Health Trends Really Help Us?",
  "summary": "In winter, many people try things like cold water swimming and drinking kombucha to stay healthy and avoid getting sick. Experts say that cold water swimming makes you feel happy and alert because of chemicals in your body, but it doesn't actually make more white blood cells to fight germs. The fun of being with friends and being outside can reduce stress, which is good for your health. Kombucha is a fermented drink that some think helps your gut and immune system, but doctors are not sure if it really works. Exercise in general can help prevent colds, but it doesn't have to be cold swimming. So, while these activities might make you feel better, they may not directly boost your immune system as much as people hope.",
