  "title": "Pegula Claims 10th WTA Title with Victory in Dubai",
  "summary": "Jessica Pegula, the American fourth seed, secured her first title of 2026 by defeating Ukrainian seventh seed Elina Svitolina in the Dubai Tennis Championships final. The match ended in straight sets, 6-2 6-4, marking Pegula's 10th WTA title. She expressed satisfaction with her performance, noting that she had reached seven consecutive semi-finals on the Tour, which built momentum for this victory. Pegula also highlighted the win as a perfect birthday gift ahead of her 32nd birthday. Svitolina, who had previously won in Dubai in 2017 and 2018, may have been fatigued from a grueling three-hour match against Coco Gauff the day before. Pegula dominated early with a double break and maintained pressure with deep, angled shots, ultimately sealing the title with an ace. This achievement makes her the third American to win the Dubai title, following Lindsay Davenport and Venus Williams. The article emphasizes Pegula's consistent form and strategic play in securing this significant win.",
