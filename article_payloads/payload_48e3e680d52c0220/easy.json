  "title": "Dogs Have a Little Bit of Wolf in Them",
  "summary": "Scientists found that most dogs have some wolf DNA in their genes, which came after dogs were first tamed long ago. This wolf DNA can affect things like how big a dog is, how well it smells, and how it acts. The study looked at many dog breeds, from big ones like Shiloh shepherds to small ones like chihuahuas, and discovered that almost all have a tiny amount of wolf ancestry. This helps dogs live well with people in different places. The lead scientist, Audrey Lin, says that even though dogs seem very different from wolves today, some traits we love in dogs might come from wolves. This research used dog and wolf genes from databases to learn about their connections.",

    "Dogs were first domesticated from wolves about 20,000 years ago, meaning humans started taming them to be companions. Over time, dogs evolved into many breeds with different sizes and jobs, like hunting or herding. Scientists study genes to understand how animals are related and how traits are passed down. This article talks about new research showing that even after domestication, dogs kept a small amount of wolf DNA, which might help them adapt to living with people. It's important because it shows how connected dogs and wolves still are, and it can help us learn more about animal evolution and behavior."
