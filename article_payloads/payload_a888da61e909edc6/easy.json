Mandelson was a government official who shared secret information with a bad person named Jeffrey Epstein.

Brown said that Keir Starmer, a leader, was too slow to fix things but is a good person who wants to do what's right. He believes Starmer can clean up the system. The police searched homes linked to Mandelson, but Mandelson says he did nothing wrong. Brown feels sad and angry because Mandelson betrayed his country by leaking secrets.",
