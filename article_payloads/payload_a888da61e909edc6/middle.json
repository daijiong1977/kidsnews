  "summary": "Former Prime Minister Gordon Brown addressed the Peter Mandelson scandal, describing it as a serious issue for Labour leader Keir Starmer.

This included details about the UK's struggling economy and a €500bn EU bailout, potentially causing commercial damage and risking the currency. Brown expressed feelings of shock and betrayal, stating that Mandelson's actions endangered Britain. While Brown criticized Starmer for being too slow to respond, he affirmed Starmer's integrity and ability to clean up the political system. Police have searched homes linked to Mandelson, who denies any criminal wrongdoing. The scandal highlights concerns about trust and transparency in government, with Brown urging Starmer to take decisive action in the coming months.",
