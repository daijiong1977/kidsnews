  "title": "TikTok Takes Down Fake Weight Loss Ads",
  "summary": "TikTok removed fake ads for weight loss drugs that pretended to be from Boots, a health and beauty store. The ads used AI to show smiling healthcare workers, but they were not real. It is against the law to advertise prescription weight loss drugs to people. Boots told TikTok about the ads, and TikTok deleted them. However, the fake account from Hong Kong was not removed at first and could upload the same videos again. After being told again, TikTok deleted the account. Weight loss drugs are only available with a doctor's prescription and strict rules. The fake ads linked to a website where people could buy the drugs, using fake customer and doctor stories made with AI. An AI expert said it is easy to make fake videos, and platforms need to act fast to stop scams.",

    "This article is about fake advertisements on TikTok, a popular app for watching and sharing videos. The ads were for weight loss drugs, which are medicines that help people lose weight but require a prescription from a doctor. Boots is a well-known store in the UK that sells health products. AI, or artificial intelligence, is a tool that can create realistic-looking videos or images, sometimes used to trick people. Scams are dishonest schemes to make money by fooling others. It's important for social media platforms like TikTok to remove fake content to keep users safe."
