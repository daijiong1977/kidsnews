  "title": "Trump's Big Move in Venezuela",
  "summary": "President Donald Trump has made a surprising decision in Venezuela. He announced that U.S. forces captured Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro and his wife in a night raid. Now, Trump says the U.S. will help run Venezuela with a team including Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Secretary of Defence Pete Hegseth. They plan to work with Venezuelans to fix the country, which has a broken economy and political problems. Trump is optimistic and wants American companies to rebuild Venezuela's infrastructure. He might send American soldiers there too. This is a big change because Trump used to criticize wars and focus on America first. The U.S. is now deeply involved in Venezuela's future.",

    "Venezuela is a country in South America that has been struggling for many years. Its economy is very poor, meaning people don't have enough money or jobs. The government has had problems, and some leaders have made it hard for the country to be stable. The U.S. is a big country that sometimes helps other nations, but this can be controversial because it involves using force or taking control. Donald Trump is the President of the United States, and he makes decisions about foreign policy, which is how the U.S. deals with other countries. This article talks about a big change where Trump is now getting involved in Venezuela after capturing its leader."
