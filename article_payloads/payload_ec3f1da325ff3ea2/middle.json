  "title": "Trump's Venezuela Intervention: A Shift in Foreign Policy",
  "summary": "In a significant development, President Donald Trump has launched a military intervention in Venezuela, capturing President Nicolas Maduro in a night raid in Caracas. Announcing this at a press conference, Trump revealed that a U.S. team, including Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Secretary of Defence Pete Hegseth, will collaborate with Venezuelans to take control and run the country. This marks an abrupt policy shift for Trump, who previously campaigned against 'forever wars' and advocated for an 'America first' approach. He aims to reconstruct Venezuela's crumbling economy and industrial infrastructure by involving American energy companies, potentially deploying U.S. soldiers. Despite contradictions, Trump remains optimistic, citing his administration's 'perfect track record of winning.' This intervention contrasts with his past actions, such as air strikes in Syria and Nigeria, as it involves deeper nation-building commitments. The U.S. now faces the challenge of owning Venezuela's future, echoing Colin Powell's warning about Iraq.",

    "Venezuela has faced severe economic and political crises for decades, with hyperinflation, shortages, and authoritarian rule under leaders like Nicolas Maduro. The U.S. has a history of interventions in Latin America, often aiming to influence regimes, but such actions are controversial due to sovereignty issues and past failures like in Iraq. Donald Trump's presidency began with a focus on 'America first,' criticizing previous interventions, but he has increasingly used military force globally, including in Syria and Iran. Nation-building involves long-term efforts to stabilize and develop a country, which can be costly and complex. This article explores how Trump's sudden shift to intervening in Venezuela could redefine his legacy and U.S. foreign policy, highlighting the risks and contradictions involved."
