    "The Grammy Awards, established in 1959, are prestigious music honors presented by the Recording Academy. Immigration policies in the U.S., particularly under the Trump administration, have been controversial, with agencies like ICE enforcing strict rules. The Windrush generation refers to Caribbean immigrants who arrived in the UK between 1948 and 1971, facing challenges and discrimination. Bad Bunny, a Puerto Rican singer, is known for blending reggaeton and other genres, and his win highlights growing Latin influence in global music. Social activism in entertainment involves artists using their fame to advocate for causes like immigrant rights."
