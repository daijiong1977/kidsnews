  "title": "A Bubbly Space Crash: The Champagne Cluster",
  "summary": "Astronomers found a special group of galaxies called the Champagne Cluster. It looks like bubbles and was discovered on New Year's Eve in 2020. This cluster is actually two groups of galaxies crashing into each other. The hot gas from the crash is shown in purple in pictures from a space telescope. The gas is stretched out, which tells scientists it's a collision. There are also two bunches of galaxies, one above and one below, showing the two groups. The hot gas and dark matter, which we can't see, make up most of the mass in this cluster. Scientists use telescopes on Earth to take pictures in colors like red, green, and blue. They compare what they see with computer games to guess how the crash happened. This helps them learn about dark matter in space.",

    "Galaxies are big groups of stars and planets in space. Sometimes, galaxies move and crash into each other, which is called a collision. Scientists use telescopes to watch these crashes and learn about space. Dark matter is a mystery in space because we can't see it, but it has weight and affects how galaxies move. The Champagne Cluster is a fun name for a galaxy crash that looks bubbly, like champagne."
