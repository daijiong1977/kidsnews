  "title": "Dangerous Metals Found in Kids' Toys",
  "summary": "Scientists in Brazil studied 70 plastic toys and found harmful metals like barium, lead, and chromium in many of them. These metals can make children sick, causing heart problems or brain damage. The toys were bought from different stores to see what kids might play with. Researchers used special tests to check for tiny amounts of metals and found 21 bad elements. Even though only a little bit comes out when a child puts a toy in their mouth, it's still dangerous because the amounts are high. The study suggests that rules need to be stricter to keep toys safe, especially those brought from other countries.",

    "Plastic toys are common and fun for kids, but sometimes they contain dangerous chemicals. Metals like lead and barium can be hidden in the plastic. When children play and put toys in their mouths, these metals can get into their bodies and cause health problems. Scientists study toys to check if they are safe and to help make better rules to protect children."
