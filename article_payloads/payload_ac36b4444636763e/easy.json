  "title": "A Family Wants a Bigger House Without Extra Tax",
  "summary": "This article talks about a family named Wesley and Toni who live near Bristol with their two daughters. They want to buy a bigger house, but they have to pay a tax called stamp duty, which adds a lot of money to the cost. Stamp duty is a tax you pay when buying expensive property in England and Northern Ireland. Wesley thinks this tax is unfair because it makes it harder for families to move. He and his wife run a sweet shop and earn about £60,000 a year, but they face high costs for sugar and other things. They hope the government will remove stamp duty in the Budget, which is a plan for taxes and spending. The article also mentions other people, like a student named Liam, who is struggling with rising food prices. Overall, it shows how taxes affect people's lives.",

    "Stamp duty is a tax in England and Northern Ireland that people pay when they buy a property costing more than a certain amount. It can make buying a house more expensive. The Budget is an important announcement by the government about how it will spend money and what taxes will change. Families like Wesley's sometimes find it hard to afford bigger homes because of these costs. Understanding taxes helps us see how they affect everyday life."
