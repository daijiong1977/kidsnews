  "title": "Will Smith's Role in Discovering a New Anaconda Species",
  "summary": "In 2024, scientists announced the discovery of a new species of giant anaconda, the northern green anaconda (Eunectes akayama), in South America. This finding was part of a 2022 expedition documented by National Geographic for their documentary series Pole to Pole with Will Smith, featuring actor Will Smith. During the Amazon leg of the journey, Smith accompanied venom expert Bryan Fry and indigenous Waorani guides on a boat trip to search for anacondas. They located a female green anaconda, approximately 16 to 17 feet long, and collected scale samples for genetic analysis. This analysis revealed that the northern green anaconda is genetically distinct from the southern green anaconda (Eunectes murinus), with the two species diverging around 10 million years ago. The new species inhabits regions including Venezuela, Colombia, Suriname, French Guyana, and northern Brazil. Smith's involvement extended beyond the Amazon; he also encountered a giant tarantula during venom extraction and traveled to diverse locations like the South Pole, Himalayas, Pacific Islands, Kalahari desert, and North Pole for the documentary, which premieres in January 2026 on Disney+.",

    "This article discusses a scientific discovery made during the production of a National Geographic documentary. In 2024, researchers identified a new species of giant anaconda, highlighting the importance of genetic studies in biodiversity. The expedition involved collaboration between scientists, indigenous communities, and celebrity Will Smith, showcasing how media can raise awareness about conservation. Anacondas are non-venomous constrictor snakes native to South America, and their discovery helps scientists understand evolutionary history and environmental health. The documentary Pole to Pole aims to educate viewers on global ecosystems and cultural experiences, premiering in 2026."
