  "summary": "In 2024, scientists found a new type of giant anaconda snake in South America. Actor Will Smith was there with a camera crew from National Geographic, who were making a documentary called Pole to Pole with Will Smith. They went on a boat trip with indigenous Waorani guides to look for anacondas in the Amazon. They found a big female green anaconda, about 16 to 17 feet long, and collected a scale sample to study. This helped scientists learn it was a new species called the northern green anaconda, which is different from the southern green anaconda. Will Smith also saw a giant tarantula and went to other places like the South Pole and Himalayas for the documentary. The show will start on TV in January 2026.",
