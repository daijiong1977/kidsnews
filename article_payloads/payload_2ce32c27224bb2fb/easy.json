  "title": "New Train Schedules Start with More Rides",
  "summary": "A big change to train timetables has started across the country. This is the biggest update in over seven years. Train companies say there will be more services and faster trips on some routes. The East Coast Main Line will see the most improvements. Passengers should check the new schedules before they travel. The changes include quicker journeys between cities like London and Edinburgh. Network Rail, which manages the tracks, has invested money to add extra seats. Some companies, like LNER, will run thousands more trains each year. However, a few routes will have fewer trains, such as between Blackpool and London. The goal is to help passengers and communities with better train services.",

    "Trains are an important way for people to travel between cities and towns. Timetables help passengers know when trains will arrive and depart. Companies like Network Rail work to improve train services by updating schedules, adding more trains, and making trips faster. These changes can help reduce travel time and provide more options for passengers, but sometimes routes might have fewer trains to balance the network."
