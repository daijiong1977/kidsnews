  "title": "Historian Upset with BBC for Cutting Trump Comment",
  "summary": "A historian named Rutger Bregman is very upset because the BBC removed a sentence about Donald Trump from his radio lecture. He gave the lecture on BBC Radio 4, and the BBC took out a line where he called Trump a 'convicted reality star' and compared him to a bad Roman emperor. The BBC said they did this because of legal advice, as Trump has threatened to sue them before. Bregman thinks this is censorship and that it's wrong to change his words out of fear. He wants people to know what happened to help keep democracy strong. This story shows how big organizations sometimes change things to avoid trouble, which can make people lose trust.",

    "The BBC is a big media company in the UK that makes news and entertainment shows. Sometimes, they have to follow rules to avoid legal problems, like when someone threatens to sue them. Donald Trump is a former US president who has been involved in many controversies. Historians like Rutger Bregman study past events and often share their ideas in lectures to help people understand the world better. Censorship means changing or hiding information, which can be bad for free speech in a democracy where everyone should be able to share opinions."
