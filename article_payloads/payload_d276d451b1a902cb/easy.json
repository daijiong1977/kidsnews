  "title": "Disney Advert Banned for Scary Image",
  "summary": "A Disney advertisement for a movie called Predator Badlands has been banned because it showed a scary picture. The ad had a big alien holding a cut-up body, which some parents said was too frightening for kids. Disney said the body was a robot, not a human, so it shouldn't be scary. The ad was shown outside in Glasgow to promote the movie before it came out in November. The Advertising Standards Authority, which checks ads, decided the ad broke rules by being too menacing and could upset children. They told Disney to make sure their ads are okay for everyone, including young kids.",

    "This article is about how ads on the street need to be safe for everyone, especially children. Sometimes, companies like Disney make ads for movies that might be too scary. When parents complain, a group called the Advertising Standards Authority checks if the ad breaks rules. They want to protect kids from seeing things that could frighten them. In this case, Disney argued the scary part was a robot, but the group still said it was too menacing."
