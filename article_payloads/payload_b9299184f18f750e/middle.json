  "title": "LA Schools Superintendent on Leave Amid Federal Probe",
  "summary": "Alberto Carvalho, the superintendent of the Los Angeles Unified School District, was placed on paid leave on Friday following FBI searches at his home and district headquarters earlier in the week. The school board voted unanimously for this action after closed-door deliberations, citing the need to await the outcome of a federal investigation. Authorities have not disclosed the nature of the investigation, which involves the district serving over 500,000 students, and no wrongdoing has been alleged against Carvalho. Andres Chait, the chief of school operations, will assume leadership temporarily to ensure stability. Carvalho, who became superintendent in 2022 after leading Miami schools, has not commented. The investigation may connect to AllHere, an education technology company that contracted with the district for an AI chatbot named 'Ed' in 2024. The district paid $3 million but ended the deal after three months when AllHere collapsed into bankruptcy; its founder was later indicted for fraud. Carvalho denied personal involvement in selecting AllHere and promised a task force to review the project, though no updates have been shared. The district is cooperating with the investigation but has provided no further details.",

    "The Los Angeles Unified School District is the second-largest in the U.S., with a complex administration led by a superintendent appointed by the school board. Federal investigations, such as those by the FBI, often involve white-collar crimes like fraud and can impact public institutions. Education technology companies like AllHere contract with schools to provide digital tools, but such deals carry risks if companies fail or engage in misconduct. Paid leave is a common administrative response during probes to maintain neutrality and operational continuity. Understanding these elements helps contextualize the events in the article."
