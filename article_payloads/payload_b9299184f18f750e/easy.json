  "title": "School Leader Takes a Break During Investigation",
  "summary": "Alberto Carvalho is the leader of Los Angeles public schools, which is a very big school district with over 500,000 students. Last week, he was put on paid leave, which means he is taking a break from his job but still getting paid. This happened after the FBI, which is a federal police agency, searched his home and the school district's office. The FBI is investigating something, but they have not said what it is about, and no one has said Carvalho did anything wrong. The school board voted to put him on leave while they wait to see what happens in the investigation. Andres Chait will be in charge while Carvalho is away. Carvalho used to work in Miami schools. The investigation might be related to a company called AllHere that made a chatbot for students, but that company went bankrupt and its leader was charged with fraud. Carvalho said he was not involved in picking that company.",

    "Los Angeles has a very large school district with many students. The superintendent is like the boss of all the schools. Sometimes, when there is an investigation, people might take a break from their jobs to let the investigation happen fairly. The FBI helps keep people safe by looking into possible problems. Companies sometimes make technology for schools, like chatbots that help students learn."
