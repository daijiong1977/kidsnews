  "title": "Uncovering a Massive CO2 Reservoir in Ocean Floor Lava Rubble",
  "summary": "Scientists have identified a significant hidden reservoir for carbon dioxide (CO2) beneath the ocean floor, composed of lava rubble known as breccia. By analyzing rock samples approximately 60 million years old from deep in the South Atlantic Ocean, researchers led by Dr. Rosalind Coggon at the University of Southampton discovered that these porous breccia layers, formed from eroded underwater mountains, can store large volumes of CO2. The process involves seawater flowing through the cooling volcanic material, where chemical reactions incorporate CO2 into minerals like calcium carbonate, cementing the rocks over time. This study is the first to clearly recognize these breccia accumulations as extensive carbon-holding structures, providing fresh insights into the long-term carbon cycle. The findings show that such deposits can contain two to 40 times more CO2 than previously sampled lavas, highlighting their role in Earth's natural carbon management over geological timescales. Understanding this mechanism helps explain how carbon moves between Earth's interior, oceans, and atmosphere, contributing to climate regulation.",

    "Carbon dioxide (CO2) is a greenhouse gas that influences Earth's climate by trapping heat in the atmosphere. The long-term carbon cycle involves the slow movement of carbon between geological reservoirs, such as rocks, oceans, and the air, over millions of years. Volcanic activity at mid-ocean ridges releases CO2 from Earth's interior, but chemical reactions with seawater can remove CO2 by storing it in minerals like calcium carbonate within ocean crust. Breccia, formed from eroded underwater mountains, provides porous structures that enhance this storage. Studying these processes helps scientists understand natural carbon sequestration and its role in regulating atmospheric CO2 levels, which is crucial for addressing climate change and Earth's historical climate shifts."
