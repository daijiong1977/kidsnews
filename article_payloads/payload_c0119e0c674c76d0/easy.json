  "title": "Scientists Find a Giant Hidden CO2 Sponge Under the Ocean",
  "summary": "Scientists have discovered a huge hidden sponge under the ocean that can soak up carbon dioxide (CO2), a gas that can warm the Earth. They studied rocks from deep in the South Atlantic Ocean that are about 60 million years old. These rocks are made of broken lava pieces called breccia, which form when underwater mountains wear down. The rocks trap CO2 from seawater as they cool and get cemented by minerals like calcium carbonate. This helps lock away CO2 for millions of years, showing how Earth naturally stores carbon. The study, led by Dr. Rosalind Coggon from the University of Southampton, is the first to clearly show these rocks as big carbon-holding structures, giving new ideas about how Earth manages carbon over long times.",

    "Carbon dioxide (CO2) is a gas in the air that comes from things like cars and factories. Too much CO2 can make Earth warmer, causing climate change. Scientists study how Earth stores CO2 over millions of years to understand natural ways to balance it. Rocks under the ocean, like lava rubble, can trap CO2 when seawater flows through them and forms minerals. This process is part of the long-term carbon cycle, where carbon moves between the air, ocean, and rocks slowly over time."
