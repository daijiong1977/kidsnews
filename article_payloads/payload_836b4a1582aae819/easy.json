  "title": "A Plan to End the War in Ukraine",
  "summary": "Ukraine's friends from other countries are worried about a plan from the United States to stop the war between Russia and Ukraine. They think the plan needs more work. The plan has some good ideas for peace, but they are concerned about how it might change Ukraine's borders and limit its army. Ukrainian President Zelensky said this is a very hard time for Ukraine because they feel pressured to accept the plan. The plan suggests that Ukrainian troops leave some areas, and Russia would keep control of places like Donetsk and Crimea. It also wants to limit the size of Ukraine's military and bring Russia back into groups like the G7. The leaders of many countries, including Canada, France, and the UK, signed a statement saying borders should not be changed by force and that Ukraine needs to be safe from future attacks.",

    "The Russia-Ukraine war started in 2022 when Russia invaded Ukraine. Many countries support Ukraine and have given help. A peace plan is a proposal to end the fighting. The G20 is a meeting of leaders from big economies to discuss global issues. Borders are important because they define a country's land. Sanctions are used to pressure countries to stop bad actions. Understanding this helps see why people are worried about the plan."
