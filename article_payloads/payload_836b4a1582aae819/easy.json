  "title": "Trump's Plan to Stop the War in Ukraine",
  "summary": "President Donald Trump has a plan to end the war between Russia and Ukraine, but he says it is not his final offer. This means he might change it. Leaders from countries like Canada, Japan, and many in Europe think the plan has good parts but needs more work. They are worried about changing Ukraine's borders and limiting its army. On Sunday, officials from the US, UK, France, Germany, and Ukraine will meet in Geneva to talk about the plan. Ukraine's President Zelensky says this is a very hard time because the US is pushing Ukraine to accept a plan that might help Russia. Trump has given Ukraine until November 27 to decide. The goal is to stop the fighting and bring peace.",
