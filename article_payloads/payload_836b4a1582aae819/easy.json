  "title": "Countries Worry About US Plan to Stop Ukraine War",
  "summary": "Some countries like those in Europe, Canada, and Japan are worried about a plan from the US to end the war between Russia and Ukraine. They think the plan needs more work because it might change Ukraine's borders and limit its army, which could make Ukraine less safe. Leaders from many countries signed a statement saying borders should not be changed by force. The US plan suggests Ukraine should pull back its troops from some areas and reduce its military size. Russia might rejoin groups like the G7 if it agrees. Talks are happening in Switzerland to discuss this further. Ukraine's president says this is a very hard time for his country.",

    "The Russia-Ukraine war started in 2022 when Russia invaded Ukraine. Many countries support Ukraine with money and weapons. A peace plan is a proposal to end the fighting. Borders are important lines that define countries, and changing them can cause problems. The G20 is a meeting of leaders from big economies to discuss global issues. Sanctions are punishments like stopping trade to pressure countries."
