  "title": "Ukraine's Friends Worry About US Peace Plan",
  "summary": "Ukraine's friends from countries like Europe, Canada, and Japan are worried about a US plan to end the war with Russia. They think the plan needs more work because it might change Ukraine's borders and limit its army, which could make Ukraine unsafe. US President Donald Trump says this is not his final plan and has given Ukraine until November 27 to agree. Leaders are meeting in Geneva to talk about it. Ukraine's President Zelensky says this is a very hard time for Ukraine because the plan might help Russia more. The friends signed a statement at a big meeting in South Africa, saying borders should not be changed by force and Ukraine needs to be protected. They will keep working on the plan together.",

    "The Russia-Ukraine war started when Russia invaded Ukraine. Many countries support Ukraine and want to help end the war. A peace plan is a set of ideas to stop fighting. Allies are countries that work together. Changing borders by force means taking land without agreement, which is not fair. Limiting an army can make a country weak and unsafe. Leaders meet at events like the G20 summit to discuss big problems."
