    "Adoption is when adults become parents to children who are not biologically theirs, often to give them a loving home. TV shows can tell stories about real-life issues to help people understand different experiences. Awards like the International Emmy are given to the best TV shows from many countries. Wales is a place in the UK with its own language and culture. LGBT families are just like other families, and their stories are important to share."
