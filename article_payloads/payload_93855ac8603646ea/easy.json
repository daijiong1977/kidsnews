  "title": "Sports Supplements Help Stores Sell More in January",
  "summary": "In January, people in Britain bought more things from stores, with sales going up by 1.8%. This increase was helped by sports supplements, which many people buy for their New Year's resolutions to get healthier. Online jewelers also sold more because gold prices went up. But experts say this might not last long because sales were almost flat for three months, and people are being careful with money due to a weak jobs market. The weather also pushed people to shop online instead of going to stores. Overall, consumers are still feeling pressure and making tough choices about spending.",

    "Retail sales measure how much people buy from stores. In Britain, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) tracks this data. New Year's resolutions often lead to increased spending on health items like sports supplements. Gold prices can affect jewelry sales. A weak jobs market means fewer people have jobs, making consumers cautious about spending money."
