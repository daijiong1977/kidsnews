  "title": "The Amazing Music of Avatar Movies",
  "summary": "The Avatar movies are famous for their stunning visuals, but the music is just as incredible. Composer Simon Franglen spent seven years creating the music for the third film, Avatar: Fire and Ash. He wrote 1,907 pages of music and even invented new instruments for the alien planet Pandora. The film has four times more music than a regular movie, and Franglen finished it just five days before the movie was ready. The story follows the Na'vi people protecting their home from humans. In this film, the main characters, Jake and Neytiri, are sad because their son died. Franglen made music to show their sadness and how they feel apart from each other. This helps audiences feel the emotions of the characters as they watch the movie.",
