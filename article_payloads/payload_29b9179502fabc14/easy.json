  "title": "Drinking Alcohol Over Time Can Increase Rectal Cancer Risk",
  "summary": "Scientists found that drinking alcohol over many years can make people more likely to get cancer in the rectum, which is part of the large intestine. They studied adults in the U.S. for 20 years and saw that those who drank a lot, like 14 or more drinks per week, had a much higher risk of rectal cancer compared to those who drank very little. The risk almost doubled for heavy drinkers. People who stopped drinking did not show this increased risk, suggesting that quitting might help. The study was published in a cancer journal and used data from a big health trial. Researchers think alcohol might create harmful substances in the body or affect gut bacteria, but more studies are needed to understand why. This helps us learn how lifestyle choices can impact health.",

    "Cancer is a disease where cells grow out of control and can harm the body. The rectum is part of the large intestine, which helps process waste. Alcohol is a common drink that can affect how our bodies work. Scientists do studies to understand how things like drinking alcohol over many years might lead to health problems like cancer. This study looked at adults in the U.S. to see if drinking more alcohol over a lifetime increases the chance of getting rectal cancer, and they found it does, especially for heavy drinkers. It also suggests that stopping drinking might help reduce this risk, which is important for making healthy choices."
