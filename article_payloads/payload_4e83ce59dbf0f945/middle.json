  "title": "Investigation into Nancy Guthrie's Disappearance Extends to Mexico",
  "summary": "The disappearance of Nancy Guthrie, an 84-year-old woman from Tucson, Arizona, has led to a widespread investigation involving US and Mexican authorities. Reported missing in early February, her case has generated over 40,000 leads, but no breakthrough has occurred despite appeals from her daughter, NBC anchor Savannah Guthrie. US investigators, including the FBI, have contacted Mexican officials in Sonora, suggesting she might have been taken across the border. A Mexican non-profit, Searching Mothers of Sonora, known for handling cases linked to drug cartels, has been enlisted by the family to assist. While ransom notes demanding cryptocurrency have emerged via media outlets like TMZ, officials have not confirmed any abduction by narco-traffickers. The investigation continues with standard cross-border cooperation, focusing on her last known whereabouts and ruling out family involvement.",
