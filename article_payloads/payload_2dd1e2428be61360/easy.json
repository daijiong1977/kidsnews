  "title": "Mysterious Stars That Solve Space Puzzles",
  "summary": "Scientists have a new idea about stars called dark stars that could help solve three big mysteries in space. The James Webb Space Telescope has seen strange things like very bright blue galaxies, huge black holes that formed too early, and little red dots that don't act like normal stars. Dark stars are special because they might be powered by dark matter, which is a mysterious substance in space. These stars could grow very big and turn into black holes. This idea helps explain why the telescope found these puzzling objects. The study was led by Professor Cosmin Ilie and other scientists. They think dark stars could be the answer to these space mysteries, making it easier to understand how the universe started.",

    "The early universe formed after the Big Bang, with stars and galaxies starting to appear. Scientists use telescopes like the James Webb to study this time. Dark matter is a mysterious part of space that we can't see but affects gravity. Stars normally use nuclear fusion for energy, but dark stars might use dark matter instead. This could explain strange objects seen in space."
