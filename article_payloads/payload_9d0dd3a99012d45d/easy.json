  "title": "A Very Old Fire Burial in Africa",
  "summary": "Archaeologists found Africa's oldest cremation site in Malawi, dating back 9,500 years. They discovered a fire pit with the burned bones of a woman. This is special because hunter-gatherers, who lived by hunting and gathering food, rarely did cremations because they take a lot of work. The woman's bones had cut marks, and her head was removed before burning. People might have done this to remember her or show respect. The fire needed lots of wood and grass, and the community worked together to build it. This shows ancient people had rituals and cared for their dead.",

    "Archaeologists study old sites to learn about how people lived long ago. In Malawi, Africa, they found a special fire pit from 9,500 years ago with burned bones. This tells us that ancient hunter-gatherers, who moved around to find food, sometimes did cremations, which is surprising because it takes a lot of effort. They might have done this to honor the dead and work together as a community."
