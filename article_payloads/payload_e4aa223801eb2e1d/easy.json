  "title": "Hidden Dimensions and Where Things Get Their Weight",
  "summary": "Scientists are exploring a new idea about where mass comes from. Mass is what makes things heavy, like you or a ball. Usually, we think mass comes from something called the Higgs field. But this article says it might come from hidden dimensions. These are extra spaces we cannot see, folded up in tiny shapes. When these shapes twist and change over time, they can create stable patterns. These patterns might explain why particles have mass without needing the Higgs field. The scientists also think this could help us understand why the universe is expanding faster. They even talk about a possible new particle called the Torstone. This idea builds on Einstein's work, which said space and time are connected. Now, scientists think geometry, or the shape of space, might be even more important in creating everything in the universe.",

    "In physics, mass is what gives objects weight and makes them hard to move. Scientists have long thought that mass comes from the Higgs field, a special part of space that particles interact with. But new ideas suggest that hidden dimensions, which are extra tiny spaces we cannot see, might be involved. These dimensions can twist and form stable shapes, possibly creating mass without the Higgs field. This connects to Einstein's theory that space and time are linked, and now scientists are exploring if the shape of space itself can explain more about the universe."
