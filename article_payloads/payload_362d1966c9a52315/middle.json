  "title": "Chaotic Opening Day in Fourth Ashes Test: Australia Takes Lead",
  "summary": "On the first day of the Fourth Ashes Test at the Melbourne Cricket Ground, a remarkable 20 wickets fell, marking the highest number in an Ashes opening day since 1909. Australia was bowled out for 152 runs, with Josh Tongue of England taking 5-45, showcasing strong bowling. England, however, struggled significantly, collapsing to 110 all out in just 29.5 overs after tea, despite Harry Brook's resilient 41 runs, including two sixes. Australia then began their second innings, ending the day at 4-0 and leading by 46 runs overall. The pitch conditions, with 10mm long grass, contributed to the batting difficulties, as noted by stand-in captain Steve Smith. This chaotic day raises concerns about a potential two-day Test, similar to the recent Perth match, and highlights England's ongoing batting crisis in the Ashes series.",
