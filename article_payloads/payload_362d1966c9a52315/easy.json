  "title": "A Crazy Cricket Day: Australia Leads England",
  "summary": "In a cricket match called the Fourth Ashes Test in Melbourne, Australia and England played on a very exciting first day. Australia scored 152 runs, and England scored 110 runs, so Australia is ahead by 46 runs. Many wickets fell—20 in total—which is a lot for one day. Josh Tongue from England bowled well and took 5 wickets. Harry Brook from England hit 41 runs with two sixes to help his team. The pitch had long grass, making it hard for batters. Australia started batting again at the end of the day, leading 4-0. This day was chaotic and fun to watch!",

    "Cricket is a team sport where players use a bat to hit a ball and score runs. The Ashes is a famous series between Australia and England. In a Test match, teams play over five days, and the goal is to score more runs than the other team. Wickets are important because they get batters out. This article talks about a very unusual first day with lots of action!"
