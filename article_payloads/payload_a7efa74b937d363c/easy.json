  "title": "Roald Dahl's James Bond Script on Show",
  "summary": "A special first draft of a James Bond movie script written by Roald Dahl is now on display at the Roald Dahl Museum. The script is for the film 'You Only Live Twice,' based on a book by Ian Fleming. Dahl was a famous children's author and a friend of Fleming. He wrote the script quickly in eight weeks. The museum has many of Dahl's things, like photos and his personal games. Dahl used his own life experiences, like being a fighter pilot, to make the story exciting. For example, a flying scene in the movie is similar to his real dogfights. The display also shows how Dahl's inventions from his games appeared in the film. It's a fun way to learn about how authors use their lives in stories.",
