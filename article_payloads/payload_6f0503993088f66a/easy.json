  "summary": "A federal judge in California said the Trump administration must stop sending National Guard troops to Los Angeles. The judge, Charles Breyer, explained that the government needs checks and balances to work fairly. Also, in New York, another judge allowed secret papers from the Jeffrey Epstein case to be opened because of a new law. In Florida, Eileen Higgins won the election to be mayor of Miami. She is the first Democrat and first woman to be mayor there in nearly 30 years. Higgins talked about helping immigrants and making people feel safe instead of scared.",

    "The National Guard is part of the military that can be called to help in disasters or other problems. Judges are important because they make sure laws are followed fairly. Elections let people vote for leaders like mayors. Immigrants are people who come to live in a new country, and they contribute to cities like Miami. This news shows how courts and elections affect our communities."
