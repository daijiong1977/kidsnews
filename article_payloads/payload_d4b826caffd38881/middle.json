  "title": "Djokovic's Dramatic Win Sparks Australian Open Excitement",
  "summary": "The Australian Open, often promoted as the 'Happy Slam', faced criticism this year for lacking high-quality matches and dramatic moments, leading to a perception that the tournament was underwhelming. However, day 13 marked a turning point. Carlos Alcaraz delivered a herculean performance to defeat Alexander Zverev in the first men's semi-final, setting a high standard. Novak Djokovic, an irrepressible 38-year-old, responded with a jaw-dropping victory over Jannik Sinner in the second semi-final, stealing the show and igniting the event. Djokovic acknowledged Alcaraz's match intensity and humorously commented on ticket value. The second week had been characterized by straightforward wins for top seeds, but these semi-finals broke the pattern, with only a few matches going beyond straight sets. Serbian fans celebrated late into the night, and one fan described it as a special moment. Djokovic's improbable win, given his age and physical concerns, ended expectations of a fourth consecutive Grand Slam final between Alcaraz and Sinner, instead setting up a final clash between Djokovic and Alcaraz.",
