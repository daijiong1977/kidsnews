  "title": "Christmas Sounds Can Be Hard for Some People",
  "summary": "Christmas is a fun time for many, but for people with misophonia, it can be very tough. Misophonia means some sounds make them feel very upset. Lottie, a 23-year-old, wears earplugs during Christmas dinner because noises like chewing and slurping make her panic and tense up. She has had this since she was 16. In the UK, almost one in five people have misophonia. Sounds from mouths or fingers can cause distress. Jenna, a 21-year-old student, uses earphones to cope. She feels angry or anxious around family. Christmas can be a nightmare for them because they want to be with family but find the sounds overwhelming. They might avoid social events to feel better.",
