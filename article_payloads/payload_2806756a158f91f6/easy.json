  "title": "A Surprising Flu Study: No One Got Sick in a Room with Flu Patients",
  "summary": "Scientists did a special test to learn about the flu. They put some college students who had the flu in a hotel room with healthy adults. Even though they were close together, none of the healthy people got sick. The researchers found two big reasons why. First, the sick students did not cough much, so not much flu virus went into the air. Second, the room had good air movement from a heater and dehumidifier, which helped spread out any virus. This study helps us understand how to stay safe during flu season. It shows that keeping air moving and avoiding close contact with coughing people can protect us. The scientists suggest using air purifiers and wearing masks like N95s when near sick people.",

    "The flu is a common illness that spreads easily, especially in cold seasons. Scientists study it to find ways to stop people from getting sick. In this test, they wanted to see how the flu moves between people in a closed space. They learned that coughing and air movement are important factors. This helps us know how to protect ourselves, like by keeping rooms well-ventilated and avoiding close contact with sick people."
