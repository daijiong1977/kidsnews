  "title": "Driving Test Touts Offer Money to Instructors",
  "summary": "A BBC investigation found that some people called touts are offering driving instructors up to £250 each month to share their special login details. These touts use the details to book many driving tests and sell them to learners for as much as £500, even though a test should only cost £75. This makes it hard for learners to book tests fairly and adds to long waiting times. The touts operate in places like London and Birmingham, and they use apps like WhatsApp to sell tests. The government plans to change rules so only learners can book tests, which might help stop the touts. Many learners are desperate because waits can be six months long.",

    "Driving tests are exams people take to get a license to drive a car. In Great Britain, many learners wait a long time for tests because there are not enough slots. Touts are people who buy things cheaply and sell them for more money, which is unfair. The BBC is a news company that investigates problems to tell people about them."
