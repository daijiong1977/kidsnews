  "title": "Investigation Reveals Driving Test Touts Exploiting Instructors and Learners",
  "summary": "A BBC investigation uncovered that touts are offering driving instructors monthly kickbacks of up to £250 to obtain their official login details for the DVSA's Online Business Service (OBS), which allows booking of driving tests. These touts use the details to bulk-book tests and resell them on platforms like WhatsApp and Facebook for up to £500, far above the standard £75 fee. This practice exacerbates lengthy waiting times, with over 642,000 learners in Great Britain waiting an average of 21 weeks for tests. The investigation found touts operating in major cities such as London, Birmingham, and Manchester, with some claiming to work with hundreds of instructors. Despite the DVSA being informed earlier in the year, some touts continue to operate. In response, the Transport Secretary announced plans to change rules so only learners can book tests, aiming to curb this exploitation. Many instructors report being approached by touts, and learners often resort to these services due to desperation over wait times that can extend to six months.",

    "Driving tests in Great Britain are administered by the DVSA to ensure road safety. Due to high demand and limited slots, waiting times have increased, leading to a backlog. Touts exploit this by reselling test slots at inflated prices, which is illegal and unfair to learners. The BBC conducted this investigation by posing as instructors and engaging with touts on social media to gather evidence. The government's proposed rule changes aim to reduce fraud and improve access for legitimate learners."
