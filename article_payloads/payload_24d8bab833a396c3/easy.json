  "title": "Cough Medicines vs. Honey and Lemon: What Helps a Cough?",
  "summary": "When you get a cough from a cold, it's your body's way of fighting the virus. Cough medicines can't cure the cold, but they can make your throat feel better by coating it or reducing the tickle. Professor Jacky Smith says cheaper store-brand medicines work just as well as expensive ones. Be careful with sugar in syrups—sugar-free options are better. Honey and lemon are homemade remedies that can soothe your throat too. For chesty coughs with phlegm, some medicines claim to loosen it, but there's not strong proof. Always follow the dose on the label to stay safe.",
