  "title": "Evaluating Cough Remedies: Medicines vs. Natural Options",
  "summary": "This article examines the effectiveness of cough medicines compared to natural remedies like honey and lemon, based on insights from Professor Jacky Smith, a respiratory medicine expert. Coughs often result from cold viruses, which medicines cannot cure, but they can alleviate symptoms by coating the throat or reducing irritation. For dry coughs, ingredients like glycerol in syrups provide relief, while cheaper supermarket brands are equally effective as name brands, though sugar content should be monitored. Active ingredients such as dextromethorphan claim to suppress cough reflexes but have minimal impact and risk addiction if misused. Levomenthol offers a cooling sensation for chesty coughs. However, ingredients like guaifenesin, purported to loosen phlegm, lack strong evidence, and sedating antihistamines may aid sleep without treating the cough. The article emphasizes skepticism towards over-the-counter claims and highlights the value of simple remedies, advising careful dosing and consideration of sugar-free options for health concerns.",
