  "title": "Europe's Big Rocket Helps Amazon Launch Satellites",
  "summary": "Europe's Ariane 6 rocket had its first big launch with four boosters, carrying 32 satellites for Amazon into space. It took off from a space center in South America and flew high into the sky. The rocket was very powerful, with over 3.4 million pounds of thrust. Amazon and the rocket company called the mission a success. Amazon is building a big group of satellites in space for internet service, and they need many rockets to launch them. They are using different rockets from companies like SpaceX and United Launch Alliance. The Ariane 6 rocket is now ready to help, but some other rockets have had problems. Amazon is working hard to get all their satellites up in time.",

    "Space rockets are vehicles that carry things like satellites into space. Satellites are machines that orbit Earth and help with things like TV, weather, and internet. Companies like Amazon use rockets to put many satellites in space to give people internet from above. Different countries and companies build rockets, and they work together to launch satellites. Sometimes rockets have problems, so companies need backup plans to get their satellites up on time."
