  "title": "Hospitals Face Big Problem with End-of-Life Care",
  "summary": "Hospitals in Sussex, England, are having a hard time helping patients who are very sick and near the end of their lives. A doctor told other health leaders that there are too many end-of-life patients in hospital beds, which might stop other sick people from getting treatment this winter. Sometimes, these patients have to be cared for in emergency room corridors because there are not enough beds or places in hospices. The doctor said this is a crisis that is getting worse. Hospitals are trying to find better ways to care for these patients, like in community settings or hospices, so they don't have to stay in the hospital. This problem could happen in other areas too as winter brings more sick people to hospitals.",

In Sussex, England, hospitals are struggling because many beds are taken by these patients, making it hard for others to get treatment. This article talks about a doctor's warning that this is a big problem getting worse."
