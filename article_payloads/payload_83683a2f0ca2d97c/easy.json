  "title": "U.S. Births Went Down in 2025",
  "summary": "In 2025, the number of babies born in the United States dropped a little. There were about 24,000 fewer births than in 2024. Experts thought births might go up after a small increase in 2024, but the new data shows that didn't happen. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) collected this information from birth certificates. People are having babies later in life because they worry about money, health insurance, and having a stable home. The government tried to help by making it easier for couples to have babies through treatments like IVF and talking about giving money to families. But so far, we only know the total number of births, not details like who is having babies or birth rates. The fertility rate, which tells if enough babies are being born to replace the population, has been going down for many years as women wait longer to have children.",

    "This article talks about how many babies were born in the United States in 2025. It uses data from the CDC, which is a government agency that keeps track of health information like births and deaths. Experts study this data to understand trends, such as why people might be having fewer babies. They look at factors like when people get married, their financial worries, and access to healthcare. The government sometimes tries to help by making it easier for families to have children, but the overall trend shows that births are going down, which affects the country's population over time."
