  "title": "A New 3D Color Scan for Seeing Inside Our Bodies",
  "summary": "Scientists have made a new machine that takes pictures inside the human body in 3D color. It shows both the shape of soft tissues and how blood vessels are working. This can help doctors find breast cancer better, check nerve damage from diabetes, and study the brain. The machine combines two old ways of taking pictures: ultrasound and photoacoustic imaging. Ultrasound uses sound waves to see tissue shape, but it's not very detailed. Photoacoustic imaging uses laser light to see blood vessels in color, but it doesn't show tissue well. By putting them together, the new machine is simpler and cheaper. It has been tested on people and could be used in hospitals soon to help patients.",

    "Medical imaging helps doctors see inside the body without surgery. Common methods include ultrasound, which uses sound waves to create pictures, and photoacoustic imaging, which uses light and sound to show blood flow. The new machine combines these to give better 3D color images, making it easier to diagnose diseases like cancer and monitor health conditions."
