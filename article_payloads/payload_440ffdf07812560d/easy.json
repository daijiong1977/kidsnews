  "title": "Mayor Helps Families Who Work Hard but Still Need Help",
  "summary": "The mayor of West Yorkshire, Tracy Brabin, talked about families who have jobs but still find it hard to pay for things like food and clothes. She said that many children in her area live in poverty, which means they don't have enough money for a good life. The mayor wants to change a rule called the two-child benefit cap so that families with more than two kids can get more help from the government. She also discussed charging tourists a small fee when they visit Yorkshire to use the money for better buses and events. This will make the area nicer for everyone. The mayor believes these changes can help kids have better opportunities as they grow up.",

    "This article is about Tracy Brabin, the mayor of West Yorkshire in England. She is part of the Labour Party and works to help people in her area. Mayors like her make decisions about money and services. In the UK, the government gives benefits to families who need help, but there was a rule called the two-child benefit cap that limited this help. The chancellor, who is in charge of the country's money, changed this rule in the Budget. This means families with more than two children can get more support. The mayor also talks about using money from tourists to improve things like buses and events, which can make life better for everyone in Yorkshire."
