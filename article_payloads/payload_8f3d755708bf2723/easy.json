  "title": "Oxford Scientists See Battery Glue to Make Batteries Better",
  "summary": "Scientists at the University of Oxford have found a new way to see a special glue inside batteries that helps them work. This glue, called a binder, holds the battery parts together and affects how fast the battery charges and how long it lasts. Before, it was hard to see where the binder was because it is very small and doesn't show up clearly. The researchers used a staining technique with silver and bromine markers to make the binder visible under a microscope. This lets them see exactly where the binder is placed in the battery. By studying this, they learned that changing how the binder is spread out can make batteries charge faster and last longer. This discovery could help make better batteries for things like electric cars and phones, making them more efficient and durable.",
