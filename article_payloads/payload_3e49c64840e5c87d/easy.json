  "title": "President Trump's Changing Feelings About a Politician",
  "summary": "This article talks about President Trump and how he treated a politician named Zohran Mamdani. At first, Trump said mean things about Mamdani, calling him a communist and threatening to take away his citizenship. But then, in a meeting in the Oval Office, Trump was very nice to him, giving him compliments and defending him. Experts Jonathan Capehart and Matthew Continetti discuss this change and why it's surprising. They also mention that Trump called six other Democrats traitors for a video they posted, saying it could be punishable by death. This shows how Trump's behavior can be unpredictable in politics. The article helps us understand how leaders interact and the importance of being fair and consistent.",

    "This article is about U.S. politics and President Trump's actions. Trump is the president of the United States, and he sometimes says and does things that surprise people. In this case, he met with Zohran Mamdani, a Democrat politician. At first, Trump was critical of Mamdani, but then he was very friendly in a meeting. This shows how politicians can change their minds or act differently in different situations. It's important to understand that leaders have power and their words can affect many people. Learning about this helps us see how government works and why it's good to pay attention to news."
