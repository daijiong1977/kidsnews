  "title": "Israel's New Land Rules in the West Bank",
  "summary": "Israel has decided to start a new process in the West Bank, an area it controls. This process involves checking who owns the land. People must show papers to prove they own the land. If they cannot, Israel might take control of the land. A group called Peace Now says this is like a big land grab from Palestinians. Palestinians are upset and say it is against international law. They want other countries to help stop this. Israel says it is doing this to make things more clear and fair. The West Bank is divided into areas, and this affects Area C, which Israel fully controls. This decision could lead to more Israeli settlements and less land for Palestinians.",

    "The West Bank is a region in the Middle East where Israelis and Palestinians both claim land. Israel has controlled it since 1967. There are disagreements over who should own the land, leading to conflicts. Settlements are communities built by Israelis in the West Bank, which Palestinians say take their land. International law often says countries should not take land by force. Groups like Peace Now work to stop settlements and promote peace."
