  "title": "How Frozen Tax Rules Affect Your Pay",
  "summary": "This article talks about how taxes work when you earn money from a job. In the UK, people pay tax on their salary, and there are rules called thresholds that decide how much tax you pay. Normally, these thresholds go up with prices, but now they are frozen until 2031. This means if your salary increases, you might pay more tax even though you earn more. The article has a calculator to help you see how this could change your take-home pay. It explains that for someone earning £39,000, the average salary, the freeze could add £465 to their tax bill by 2030-31. The freeze affects employees in England, Wales, and Northern Ireland, but not Scotland or self-employed workers. It's important because it shows how government decisions can impact how much money people keep from their work.",

    "Taxes are payments people make to the government from money they earn, like from jobs. In the UK, there are rules called tax thresholds that decide how much tax you pay based on your salary. Normally, these thresholds increase with inflation so people don't pay more tax just because prices go up. But now, the government has frozen these thresholds until 2031, meaning they won't change even if salaries rise. This article explains how this freeze could mean people pay more tax on higher salaries, reducing their take-home pay. It uses examples and a calculator to show the impact, helping readers understand a key financial issue."
