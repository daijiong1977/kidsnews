  "title": "AI Detects Chronic Stress Biomarker in CT Scans",
  "summary": "Researchers have developed a deep learning AI model that identifies a new biomarker for chronic stress visible in standard chest CT scans. Chronic stress impacts both mental and physical health, contributing to conditions like anxiety, high blood pressure, and heart disease. The study, led by Dr. Elena Ghotbi at Johns Hopkins University, analyzed data from 2,842 participants in the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis. The AI automatically measured adrenal gland volume from CT scans, creating an Adrenal Volume Index (AVI). This index correlated with stress indicators such as cortisol levels, allostatic load, and psychosocial questionnaires. Higher AVI values were linked to increased cortisol exposure, greater allostatic load, and higher risks of heart failure and death. The findings, presented at the Radiological Society of North America meeting, suggest that this AI-driven biomarker can use existing imaging data to assess stress without additional tests, potentially improving cardiovascular risk prediction and preventive care.",

    "Chronic stress is a widespread issue that affects health by contributing to diseases like heart conditions. Medical imaging, such as CT scans, is routinely used for diagnostics. AI technologies, including deep learning, are advancing healthcare by analyzing large datasets to find new insights. Biomarkers like cortisol have been used to measure stress, but they have limitations, making new methods like imaging-based indices valuable for long-term assessment."

    "Main Points: The study introduces an AI-derived biomarker, Adrenal Volume Index (AVI), from CT scans to measure chronic stress, linking it to cortisol, allostatic load, and cardiovascular risks. Purpose: To provide a non-invasive, scalable way to assess stress using existing medical images, improving preventive care. Evidence Evaluation: Strong evidence from a large cohort study with multiple stress indicators, but limited by retrospective data. Author Credibility: Led by medical researchers at Johns Hopkins University, with expertise in radiology and stress studies. Methodology: Used deep learning on CT scans from 2,842 participants, correlating AVI with biochemical and psychosocial data over up to 10 years."
