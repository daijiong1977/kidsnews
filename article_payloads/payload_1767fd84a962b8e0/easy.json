  "title": "AI Spots Stress in Body Scans",
  "summary": "Scientists have created a smart computer program called AI that can find signs of long-term stress in pictures from CT scans, which are common medical tests. Stress can make people feel sad or sick, leading to problems like heart disease. The researchers used the AI to look at CT scans from thousands of people and measure their adrenal glands, small organs in the body. They found that bigger adrenal glands mean more stress, and this can help doctors predict heart issues without extra tests. This discovery was shared at a big medical meeting and could help many people stay healthier by checking stress easily.",
