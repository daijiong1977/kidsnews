  "title": "AI-Driven Imaging Biomarker Reveals Chronic Stress in CT Scans",
  "summary": "A groundbreaking study utilizes a deep learning artificial intelligence model to establish the first imaging-based biomarker for chronic stress, detectable in routine chest CT scans. Chronic stress, known to exacerbate conditions such as cardiovascular disease, depression, and immune dysfunction, has historically been assessed through subjective questionnaires or cumbersome biochemical markers like cortisol. Researchers, led by Dr. Elena Ghotbi at Johns Hopkins University, analyzed a cohort of 2,842 participants from the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis, integrating CT imaging, salivary cortisol measurements, allostatic load indices, and psychosocial assessments. The AI model automated the measurement of adrenal gland volume, deriving an Adrenal Volume Index (AVI) that correlated significantly with cortisol exposure, allostatic load, and stress questionnaire scores. Longitudinal data revealed that elevated AVI values were associated with increased risks of heart failure and mortality, independent of traditional risk factors. Presented at the Radiological Society of North America, this research demonstrates the potential of leveraging existing imaging data for large-scale stress evaluation, offering a novel tool for cardiovascular risk stratification and personalized preventive strategies without additional testing.",
