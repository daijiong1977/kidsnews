  "title": "California Stops Fighting for Train Money",
  "summary": "California has stopped a lawsuit it started to get back money from the federal government for a high-speed train project. The train is supposed to go from San Francisco to Los Angeles, but it has been delayed and costs a lot of money. The Trump administration took away $4 billion in funding, saying California did not have a good plan to finish the train. California's governor called this a political move. Now, California is looking for other ways to pay for the train, like private investors and a state program that helps reduce pollution. The train authority says this is a new chance to build the train without the federal government's help, using ideas from other countries that have fast trains.",

    "This article is about a big train project in California that has faced problems. High-speed trains are very fast and can help people travel quickly between cities, but they cost a lot of money to build. Sometimes, governments argue about who should pay for such projects. In this case, California and the federal government disagreed, so California is trying new ways to get the money needed to finish the train."
