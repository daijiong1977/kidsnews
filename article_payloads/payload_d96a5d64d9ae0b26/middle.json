  "title": "Clinton Accuses Trump Administration of Epstein Files Cover-Up",
  "summary": "In a BBC interview, Hillary Clinton accused the Trump administration of a cover-up regarding the handling of files related to Jeffrey Epstein, a convicted sex offender. She demanded the immediate release of all files, criticizing the slow pace as 'slow-walking.' The U.S. Department of Justice recently released millions of files but withheld three million pages due to sensitive content like personal medical records and graphic abuse depictions that could harm investigations. Hillary and Bill Clinton are scheduled to testify before a congressional committee, with Bill appearing on February 27 and Hillary the day before. They advocate for public hearings rather than closed-door sessions to ensure transparency. A contempt vote against them was avoided after they agreed to testify. Hillary emphasized their commitment to fairness and having nothing to hide, while Republican committee chair James Comer accused them of delays. The situation highlights tensions over government transparency and accountability in high-profile cases.",

    "Jeffrey Epstein was a financier convicted of sex trafficking and abuse, whose case has sparked widespread investigations into his network. The U.S. Department of Justice handles legal matters and file releases, often balancing transparency with privacy concerns. Congressional committees, like the one involved here, have powers to investigate and subpoena witnesses, though they cannot always compel testimony from private individuals. Historical context includes Gerald Ford's 1983 testimony as a former president, highlighting the rarity of such events. The Clintons are prominent political figures with a history of public service and scrutiny, adding complexity to this situation involving government accountability and victim advocacy."
