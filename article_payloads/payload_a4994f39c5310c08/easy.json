  "title": "Tiny Plant Survives in Space",
  "summary": "Scientists discovered that a small plant called moss can survive in outer space. They tested moss spores, which are like tiny seeds, by sending them to the International Space Station. The spores stayed outside the station for nine months in the vacuum of space, where there is no air, extreme cold and heat, and strong radiation. Amazingly, over 80% of the spores survived and could still grow when they returned to Earth. This is the first time an early land plant has been shown to live through long space exposure. The lead scientist, Tomomichi Fujita, was surprised because most living things, including humans, cannot survive in space. Mosses are already tough, living in harsh places like deserts and Antarctica. The spores are protected by a special covering that shields them from harm. This finding helps us understand how life might survive beyond Earth.",

    "Mosses are small plants that can live in tough places like deserts, mountains, and cold areas. They reproduce using spores, which are tiny and can wait a long time to grow. Outer space has no air, extreme temperatures, and radiation that can damage living things. Scientists study how life might survive in space to learn about plants and possible life on other planets. This experiment showed that moss spores are very strong and could help in future space missions."
