  "title": "Raducanu's Gritty Path to a Tennis Final After US Open Success",
  "summary": "Emma Raducanu has advanced to her first final since her stunning 2021 US Open victory, defeating Oleksandra Oliynykova in a hard-fought three-set match at the Transylvania Open. This achievement marks a significant comeback for Raducanu, who, at age 18, made history as the first qualifier to win a Grand Slam at the US Open. However, her career since then has been hampered by numerous injuries and frequent coaching changes, leading to inconsistent performances on the WTA Tour. Prior to this, she had lost her last three semi-finals, with the US Open remaining her only senior trophy. The win against Oliynykova, which took nearly three hours, demonstrates Raducanu's resilience and determination. Additionally, fellow British player Katie Boulter reached her first final in over 15 months at the Ostrava Open, meaning both British women will compete in Tour-level finals on the same day—a first in history. Raducanu expressed gratitude for the support in Romania, where her father is from, and will now face Romanian third seed Sorana Cirstea in the final, aiming for her first silverware in five years.",
