  "title": "Controversy Over Racist Slur and Editing at Bafta Awards",
  "summary": "Labour MP Dawn Butler has demanded an urgent explanation from the BBC after a racist slur was broadcast during the Bafta Film Awards. The incident occurred when John Davidson, a guest with Tourette syndrome, shouted the N-word as black actors Delroy Lindo and Michael B Jordan appeared on stage. Although the ceremony aired on a two-hour delay, the BBC failed to edit out the offensive language, leading to an apology and removal from BBC iPlayer. Butler criticized this oversight, calling it 'painful and unforgivable,' and questioned why the slur was missed while other inappropriate content was cut. She also raised concerns about the editing of winner Akinola Davies Jr's speech, which included the phrase 'Free Palestine' and was shortened due to time constraints. The BBC responded that all edits were made to keep the program on schedule and that full speeches are available on Bafta's YouTube channel. This situation highlights issues of accountability, editing practices, and sensitivity in broadcasting, sparking debate over how media handles offensive material and free expression.",
