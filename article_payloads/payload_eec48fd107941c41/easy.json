  "title": "A TV Mistake with a Bad Word",
  "summary": "A politician named Dawn Butler is upset with the BBC because a bad word was said on TV during an awards show. The Bafta Film Awards were on Sunday, and a guest with Tourette syndrome shouted a racist word when two black actors were on stage. The BBC said sorry and removed the word from the online version, but the show was on a two-hour delay, so they could have edited it out before it aired. Dawn Butler thinks this was a big mistake and wants to know why it happened. She also asks why another part of the show, where a winner said 'Free Palestine,' was cut out. The BBC says they cut things to save time. This story is about making sure TV shows are respectful and fair to everyone.",
