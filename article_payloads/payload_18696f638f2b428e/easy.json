  "title": "Scientists Map Deep Earthquakes Inside Our Planet",
  "summary": "Scientists at Stanford University have made the first map of special earthquakes that happen deep inside Earth, in a layer called the mantle. The mantle is below the crust, which is the outer layer we live on. These deep earthquakes are rare and don't cause shaking or damage on the surface, but they help scientists learn how all earthquakes start. The map shows that these earthquakes happen all over the world, with more in places like the Himalayas and near the Bering Strait. By studying them, researchers hope to understand Earth's inside better and how it moves. This work was published in a science journal and uses new methods to detect these deep events from seismic waves, which are vibrations that travel through Earth after an earthquake.",

    "Earth is made up of different layers: the crust on the outside, the mantle in the middle, and the core at the center. Earthquakes usually happen in the crust, but scientists have found some that start deep in the mantle. These deep earthquakes are rare and help us understand how our planet works inside. By mapping them, scientists can learn more about Earth's structure and movements."
