  "title": "Mapping Rare Mantle Earthquakes to Uncover Earthquake Origins",
  "summary": "Researchers from Stanford University have developed the first global map of continental mantle earthquakes, which occur deep within Earth's mantle rather than the crust. Published in Science, this study identifies 459 such earthquakes since 1990, revealing clusters in regions like the Himalayas and near the Bering Strait. These deep events are rare, occurring about 100 times less frequently than crustal earthquakes, and do not cause surface damage, but they provide crucial insights into earthquake initiation and Earth's internal dynamics. The team used a novel technique analyzing seismic waves—specifically Sn and Lg waves—to distinguish mantle earthquakes from crustal ones, overcoming previous data limitations. By understanding these deep tremors, scientists aim to improve knowledge of more common shallow earthquakes and the behavior of the upper mantle, which influences volcanic activity and tectonic plate movement. This breakthrough could enhance earthquake hazard assessment and reveal details about the Moho boundary between the crust and mantle.",

    "Earth's structure consists of the crust, mantle, and core, with the mantle being a thick, ductile layer that makes up most of the planet's volume. Earthquakes typically originate in the brittle crust, but some occur deeper in the mantle, challenging previous assumptions about earthquake mechanics. The Moho boundary marks the transition between crust and mantle, and studying deep earthquakes can reveal information about this interface and upper mantle behavior, which affects volcanic activity and plate tectonics. Seismic waves, such as Sn and Lg, are tools used by geophysicists to analyze earthquake sources and Earth's interior properties."
