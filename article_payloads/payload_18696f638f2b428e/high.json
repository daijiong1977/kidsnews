  "title": "Global Mapping of Continental Mantle Earthquakes: Implications for Seismology and Earth Dynamics",
  "summary": "A groundbreaking study by Stanford University researchers has produced the first comprehensive global map of continental mantle earthquakes, published in Science. This research identifies 459 such events since 1990, utilizing an innovative seismic wave analysis technique that compares Sn (lid) waves and Lg waves to differentiate mantle origins from crustal ones. The findings reveal spatial clustering in regions such as the Himalayas and near the Bering Strait, offering insights into the mechanics of earthquake initiation and the behavior of the upper mantle, which plays a critical role in volcanic magma generation and tectonic plate motion. Mantle earthquakes are exceptionally rare, occurring approximately 100 times less frequently than crustal earthquakes, and do not pose surface hazards, but they serve as a novel probe into Earth's internal structure beyond the Mohorovičić discontinuity. By overcoming previous data limitations through advanced waveform analysis, this study enhances our understanding of seismogenic processes and may inform hazard assessments for more common shallow earthquakes. The work underscores the importance of interdisciplinary geophysical research in unraveling the complexities of planetary dynamics.",

    "Earth's interior is stratified into the crust, mantle, and core, with the mantle comprising most of the planet's volume and exhibiting ductile behavior under high temperatures and pressures. The Mohorovičić discontinuity (Moho) marks a seismic velocity change between crust and mantle, and understanding earthquakes beyond this boundary challenges traditional seismology. Mantle earthquakes, though rare, offer a unique window into deep Earth processes, including stress release mechanisms and mantle convection. Seismic wave analysis, particularly of body waves like Sn and Lg, is essential for source characterization, and advancements in this field contribute to broader knowledge in geophysics, plate tectonics, and natural hazard mitigation."
