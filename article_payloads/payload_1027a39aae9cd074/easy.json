  "title": "A New Ghost Marsupial Found in Australia",
  "summary": "Scientists in Australia have discovered a new type of animal called a ghost marsupial, which is related to kangaroos. They found fossils in caves that show this animal lived long ago but is now extinct. The animal is a kind of bettong, and they also found two new types of woylies, which are small kangaroo relatives. Woylies are important because they help the soil by digging for mushrooms, but they are in danger of disappearing. The scientists used bones to learn about these animals and want to protect them better. They named the new species Bettongia haoucharae and will work with Indigenous people to choose a good name.",

    "In Australia, there are many unique animals like kangaroos and marsupials. Marsupials are animals that carry their babies in pouches. Scientists study fossils to learn about animals that lived long ago. Conservation helps protect animals that are in danger. Indigenous people have lived in Australia for thousands of years and know a lot about the land and animals."
