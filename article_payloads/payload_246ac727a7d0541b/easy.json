  "title": "A New Lawyer for the Georgia Election Case",
  "summary": "In Georgia, there is a big court case about the 2020 election. Former President Trump and his friends are accused of trying to change the election results. They are said to have asked Georgia officials to count votes differently. The first prosecutor, Fani Willis, was in charge but had to step down after a legal fight. Now, a new prosecutor is taking over the case. This means the trial can continue. It's important because it's the last criminal case against Trump. The case helps us understand how elections should be fair and why following the law matters. Everyone is watching to see what happens next in court.",

    "This case is about the 2020 presidential election in the United States. Elections are when citizens vote for their leaders, like the president. Sometimes, people might try to change the results unfairly, which is against the law. In Georgia, a state in the U.S., officials count votes to decide who wins. If someone is accused of breaking election laws, a prosecutor brings the case to court. This helps ensure that elections are honest and fair for everyone."
