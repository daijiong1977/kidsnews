  "title": "A Brave Man's Story: Living with a Muscle Disease",
  "summary": "Ben Morris is a man who has a disease called Spinal Muscular Atrophy, or SMA. This disease makes his muscles weak. When he was a baby, doctors thought he might not live past two years old because SMA can make it hard to breathe, especially when sick. But Ben is now 25 years old! He uses an electric wheelchair to move around and a ventilator at night to help him breathe. He takes medicine every day to stay healthy. Ben works as a journalist and lives on his own with help from assistants. He also has friends with SMA, and they support each other. Ben's story shows that even with challenges, people can live happy and full lives.",

    "Spinal Muscular Atrophy (SMA) is a genetic disease that affects the nerves and muscles, making them weak. It can start in babies and make it hard to move, breathe, or eat. Some people with SMA use wheelchairs or breathing machines. With support and medicine, many people with SMA can live longer and do things they enjoy, like going to school or working. Ben's story teaches us about being brave and helping others."
