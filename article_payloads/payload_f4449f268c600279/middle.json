  "title": "Overcoming SMA: A Journalist's Journey from Diagnosis to Independence",
  "summary": "Ben Morris, a BBC journalist, shares his personal experience with Spinal Muscular Atrophy (SMA) type two, a genetic disorder that weakens muscles and affects breathing. Diagnosed at six months old in 2001, doctors initially predicted he might not survive beyond age two due to respiratory risks from infections. However, Ben defied expectations and is now 25, living independently with support from personal care assistants. He uses an electric wheelchair for mobility and a ventilator overnight to assist with breathing, as his condition makes shallow sleep breathing a concern. Daily medication, Risdiplam, helps stabilize his SMA, though he notes that treatments like Zolgensma are only for infants. Ben's journey includes support from SMA UK charity and friendships with others who have SMA, providing mutual encouragement. His story highlights advancements in medical care and the importance of community, demonstrating how individuals with chronic conditions can lead fulfilling lives and pursue careers, such as his role in journalism.",

    "Spinal Muscular Atrophy (SMA) is a genetic disorder caused by a mutation in the SMN1 gene, leading to progressive muscle weakness and wasting. It is classified into types based on severity and age of onset, with type two typically appearing in early childhood and affecting mobility and respiratory function. Treatments have advanced in recent years, including drugs like Risdiplam and gene therapies like Zolgensma, which can slow progression but are often limited to early intervention. SMA impacts daily life, requiring assistive devices like wheelchairs and ventilators, and support from charities and communities is crucial for managing the condition. Ben's experience reflects broader issues in healthcare accessibility and the resilience of individuals with disabilities."
