  "title": "France and UK Work Together to Stop Small Boats",
  "summary": "France has decided to start stopping small boats in the Channel after the UK asked for help. This is because many people try to cross the sea in unsafe boats to reach the UK. French police will now try to stop these boats before they pick up passengers to keep everyone safe. They won't use nets that could damage the boats. This change happened after the UK's leader wrote a letter to France's president. The weather is windy, so it might delay the start. Both countries are working together to solve this problem and protect people from danger.",

    "The Channel is a sea between France and the UK where people sometimes try to cross in small, overcrowded boats to seek a better life. This can be very dangerous because the boats might sink or people could get hurt. France and the UK are countries that work together to handle this issue. Police help by enforcing rules to protect everyone involved."
