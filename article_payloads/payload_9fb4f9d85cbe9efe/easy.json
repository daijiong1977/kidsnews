  "summary": "Lawyers for two people who do not like President Donald Trump are going to court. They want a judge to throw out the charges against them. The lawyers say that the prosecutor who charged them was not appointed correctly. A prosecutor is a lawyer who works for the government and brings cases to court. This hearing is happening on Thursday. The judge will listen to both sides and decide what to do. It is important because it could affect the cases against these two people. The Justice Department is the part of the government that handles legal matters. This story shows how the legal system works to make sure rules are followed.",

    "This article is about a legal challenge in the United States. The Justice Department has charged two people who are opponents of former President Donald Trump. Their lawyers are arguing that the prosecutor who brought the charges was not appointed legally. A federal judge will hear this argument on Thursday. If the judge agrees, the cases could be dismissed. This shows how the court system checks if rules are followed in legal appointments."
