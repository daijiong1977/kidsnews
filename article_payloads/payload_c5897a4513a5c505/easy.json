  "title": "Copper Helps Make Clean Ammonia for Plants",
  "summary": "Scientists in Tokyo found a cool way to make ammonia, which is used in fertilizers to help plants grow. They used a material called copper oxide that changes during a reaction to help turn nitrates into ammonia. This new way is better for the environment because it doesn't need high heat or pressure like the old method, which makes a lot of pollution. Ammonia is super important for food, so making it cleanly helps our planet. The researchers used special tools to watch how copper particles form and help make ammonia. This discovery could lead to greener ways to produce ammonia in the future.",

    "Ammonia is a chemical that is very important for making fertilizers, which help crops grow and provide food for people. The old way to make ammonia, called the Haber-Bosch process, uses a lot of energy and creates pollution. Scientists are looking for new ways to make ammonia that are better for the environment, like using electricity and special materials called catalysts."
