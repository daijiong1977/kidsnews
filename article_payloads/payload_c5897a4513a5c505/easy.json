  "title": "How Scientists Make Cleaner Fertilizer with Copper",
  "summary": "Scientists in Tokyo found a cool way to make ammonia, which is used in fertilizers to help plants grow. Normally, making ammonia uses a lot of energy and creates pollution, but they used a special material called copper oxide in a reaction that works at room temperature. They discovered that tiny copper pieces form during the reaction and help turn nitrite into ammonia. This new method is better for the environment because it doesn't need high heat or pressure. Understanding this step could lead to cleaner ways to produce important chemicals for farming, helping our planet.",

    "Ammonia is a key ingredient in fertilizers that help crops grow, feeding people around the world. Most ammonia is made using the Haber-Bosch process, which requires high heat and pressure and releases a lot of carbon dioxide, harming the environment. Scientists are looking for better ways, like using electricity and catalysts such as copper oxide, to make ammonia at room temperature. This new approach could reduce energy use and pollution, making farming more sustainable. Learning about these methods helps us understand how science can protect our planet."
