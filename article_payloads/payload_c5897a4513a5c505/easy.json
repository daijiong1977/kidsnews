  "title": "How a Copper Switch Helps Make Clean Ammonia",
  "summary": "Scientists in Tokyo found a special way to make ammonia, which is used in fertilizers to help plants grow. Normally, making ammonia uses a lot of energy and creates pollution. But this new method uses electricity and a material called copper oxide to change nitrates into ammonia at room temperature. They discovered that tiny copper pieces form during the reaction and help make ammonia faster. This is better for the environment because it doesn't produce as much carbon dioxide. Understanding this process could lead to cleaner ways to produce ammonia, helping farmers and reducing harm to the planet.",

    "Ammonia is a key ingredient in fertilizers that help crops grow, feeding people around the world. Most ammonia is made using the Haber-Bosch process, which requires high heat and pressure, using lots of energy and releasing carbon dioxide that contributes to climate change. Scientists are looking for better ways, like using electricity and catalysts, to make ammonia without harming the environment. This article talks about a discovery in Tokyo that uses copper oxide to make ammonia more cleanly at normal temperatures, which could lead to greener farming and a healthier planet."
