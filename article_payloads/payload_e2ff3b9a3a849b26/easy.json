  "title": "Netflix Says No to Buying Warner Bros., Paramount Might Take Over",
  "summary": "Netflix decided not to buy Warner Bros. Discovery's studio and streaming business because the price got too high. This means Paramount, another big company, might buy Warner Bros. instead. Paramount wants to buy all of Warner Bros., including popular shows and movies like Harry Potter and CNN. Netflix said it would have been a good owner, but only at the right price. This deal could change Hollywood by putting two big studios together. Some people worry this might make fewer choices for viewers and higher costs for streaming services.",
