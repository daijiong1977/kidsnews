  "title": "Swiss Ski Resort Fire: Why People Are Asking Questions",
  "summary": "A big fire happened at a bar in Crans-Montana, a ski resort in Switzerland, on New Year's Eve. Many young people were hurt or died. People are sad and angry because they found out the bar had not been checked for fire safety since 2019. In Switzerland, local mayors like Nicolas Feraud are supposed to check bars every year to make sure they are safe. But Mayor Feraud said only 40 out of 128 bars in Crans-Montana were checked in 2025. He said there were not enough inspectors to do all the checks. Other mayors in the area, like Romy Biner from Zermatt, also said they do not have enough resources. Swiss journalists asked if the mayor knew the bar owners well or if there was corruption, but he said no. A mother whose sons survived wants clear answers. People are wondering if the Swiss government system, where local officials make decisions, is working properly after this fire.",

    "Switzerland is a country in Europe known for its mountains and ski resorts. It has a government system where local towns and villages make their own rules with elected officials like mayors. This is called a devolved system, which means decisions are made close to home. Fire safety checks are important to prevent accidents in places like bars where many people gather. After a fire, people often ask questions to understand what went wrong and how to make things safer in the future."
