  "title": "Trump Supports His Helper After Secret Talk with Russia",
  "summary": "President Donald Trump is supporting his special helper, Steve Witkoff, after a secret recording was shared. In the recording, Witkoff seemed to be giving advice to a Russian official on how to make President Trump happy. Trump says Witkoff was just doing his job as a dealmaker to help with peace talks between Russia and Ukraine. The peace plan from the US was first seen as too good for Russia, but it has been changed to be fairer. Witkoff has met with Russian President Putin many times but has not visited Ukraine's capital, Kyiv. Ukrainian President Zelensky wants to talk with Trump to solve problems. The secret call was about setting up a phone call between Trump and Putin to discuss ending the war.",
