  "title": "Birdgirl's Decade of Promoting Nature Access for Minority Youth",
  "summary": "Dr. Mya-Rose Craig, nicknamed Birdgirl, established the charity Black2Nature at age 13 to address the underrepresentation of Visible Minority Ethnic (VME) children in nature activities. Over the past decade, the organization has conducted camps, day trips, and outdoor adventures, impacting hundreds of young people. Dr. Craig reflects that societal attitudes have evolved since she began advocating for diversity in environmental spaces, though she acknowledges ongoing challenges. The charity not only facilitates access to green spaces but also campaigns for racial diversity in the environmental sector. Research cited indicates that ethnic minorities have significantly less access to green areas, highlighting systemic issues. Dr. Craig's motivation stems from a personal love of nature and a belief in its benefits for mental and physical well-being. She emphasizes the importance of inclusivity to foster a sustainable future, noting that many VME children feel excluded from rural settings. This article underscores the intersection of environmental justice and social equity, showcasing grassroots efforts to bridge gaps in nature engagement.",
