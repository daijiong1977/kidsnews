  "summary": "Dr. Mya-Rose Craig, known as Birdgirl, started a charity called Black2Nature when she was 13 years old. Her goal is to help children from ethnic minorities go outside and enjoy nature. For 10 years, she has organized camps and trips so kids can explore the countryside. Many of these children have never been to green spaces before. Dr. Craig says that when she first talked about this issue, people felt uncomfortable, but now things are changing. She believes nature is important for everyone's health and happiness. Her charity also works to make sure all people have equal access to parks and outdoor areas. By getting more kids involved, she hopes to build a better environment for the future.",

    "This article is about a young woman named Dr. Mya-Rose Craig, who loves nature and wants to share it with others. She noticed that many children from ethnic minority groups do not get to visit parks or the countryside as much as other kids. To fix this, she created a charity called Black2Nature when she was just a teenager. Over 10 years, she has helped hundreds of kids go on outdoor adventures, like camping and day trips. Dr. Craig also talks to people about making sure everyone feels welcome in nature spaces. She believes that spending time outside is good for our health and happiness, and she works hard to break down barriers so all children can enjoy the outdoors."
