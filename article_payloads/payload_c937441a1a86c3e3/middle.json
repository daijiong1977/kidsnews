  "title": "Pope Addresses Prison Overcrowding and Rehabilitation in Holy Year Mass",
  "summary": "Pope Leo XIV highlighted significant issues in the prison system during a special Mass in Rome for detainees, guards, and their families, marking the conclusion of the Vatican's 2025 Holy Year. He criticized prison overcrowding and insufficient rehabilitation programs, emphasizing the need for educational and job opportunities to help inmates reintegrate into society. The Pope called for charity and forgiveness towards both prisoners and guards, acknowledging the poor conditions often faced even in wealthier nations. This event was the last major activity of the Holy Year, initiated by Pope Francis in 2024 to spread hope to marginalized groups. Pope Francis had previously visited Rebibbia prison to include inmates in Jubilee celebrations and appealed for global prison amnesties. In Italy, prison overcrowding is a severe problem, with facilities at 135% capacity and increasing complaints of inhumane treatment, as reported by advocacy groups like Antigone. The Mass attracted around 6,000 participants, including international representatives, underscoring the global concern for prison reform.",

    "Prison systems worldwide often struggle with overcrowding, where too many inmates are housed in facilities designed for fewer people, leading to unsafe and inhumane conditions. Rehabilitation programs aim to reduce recidivism by providing education, job training, and psychological support to help prisoners reintegrate into society after release. The Catholic Church's Holy Year, or Jubilee, is a time of spiritual reflection and mercy, historically involving acts like granting indulgences or advocating for social justice issues such as prison reform. Pope Francis has emphasized ministering to marginalized groups, including prisoners, as part of his papacy, promoting messages of hope and forgiveness. In Italy, advocacy groups like Antigone monitor prison conditions and report on human rights violations, highlighting the need for systemic changes to address overcrowding and improve treatment."
