  "title": "Pope Speaks About Crowded Prisons at a Special Church Service",
  "summary": "Pope Leo XIV talked about problems in prisons during a special church service for prisoners, guards, and their families in Rome. He said many prisons are too crowded, which means there are too many people in small spaces. He also mentioned that prisoners need better programs to learn new skills and find jobs when they leave prison. The Pope asked everyone to be kind and forgiving to prisoners and guards. This event was part of a big celebration called the Holy Year, which started in 2024 to give hope to people who are often forgotten. The Pope remembered that Pope Francis visited a prison last year and asked governments to help prisoners by giving them pardons. In Italy, prisons are very overcrowded, with more people than beds, and many complaints about bad treatment.",

    "Prisons are places where people who have done something wrong are kept as punishment. Sometimes, too many people are put in prisons, making them crowded and uncomfortable. Leaders like the Pope work to help prisoners by asking for better conditions and programs to help them learn and find jobs after they leave. The Holy Year is a special time in the Catholic Church when people focus on hope and forgiveness, especially for those who are often left out, like prisoners. In Italy, this is a big issue because prisons have more people than they can hold, leading to problems."
