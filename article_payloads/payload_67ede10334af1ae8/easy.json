  "title": "A Sad Boat Accident That Could Have Been Stopped",
  "summary": "In 2021, a small boat carrying people trying to cross the English Channel sank, and at least 30 people drowned. This was the worst accident like this ever recorded. Only two people survived after waiting for help for almost 12 hours. An inquiry, which is like a big investigation, found that this tragedy could have been avoided. The people on the boat came from countries like Iraq and Afghanistan, and they started from a beach in France. The inquiry said there were big problems with how the government and coastguard handled the situation. For example, the coastguard had too few staff and missed calls from the boat. Also, a plane that could have helped didn't fly because of bad weather, and there was no backup plan. The inquiry pointed out three main mistakes: smugglers put too many people on the boat, a French ship was slow to help, and the coastguard's rescue operations had flaws. Families of the victims had to wait over two years for the inquiry to start, and it showed that more people might have been saved if help had come sooner.",
