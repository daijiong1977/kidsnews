  "title": "Measles Outbreak in London Schools: Unvaccinated Kids Might Stay Home",
  "summary": "In north London, there is a measles outbreak, which is a very contagious sickness. Schools might tell kids who haven't gotten their measles shots to stay home for 21 days if they were near someone with measles. This is to stop the disease from spreading. So far, 34 children in Enfield have gotten measles this year, and some had to go to the hospital. Doctors are worried because more kids are getting sick than usual. Measles can be serious, so it's important for children to get vaccinated to stay healthy and protect others. The government is trying to get more kids vaccinated to prevent outbreaks like this.",
