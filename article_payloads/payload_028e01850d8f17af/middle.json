  "title": "Exploring Pregnancy Challenges in America Through a Podcast Interview",
  "summary": "In the 'Settle In' podcast hosted by Amna Nawaz on PBS NewsHour, journalist Irin Carmon discusses her new book 'Unbearable: Five Women and the Perils of Pregnancy in America.' The book follows five women from New York and Alabama as they navigate pregnancy in a post-Roe v. Wade landscape, where legal changes have impacted reproductive healthcare. Carmon explains that most women in her book want to continue their pregnancies and raise their children, but they face significant barriers due to American medicine and law. These barriers include inadequate miscarriage care, unsafe birth conditions, and limited access to pregnancy termination when needed. The stories unfold across different stages of pregnancy, highlighting how socioeconomic factors and geographic location influence experiences, yet common challenges persist. The podcast aims to shed light on these issues by sharing personal narratives, emphasizing the need for better healthcare systems and legal protections. It serves as an educational tool to inform listeners about the complexities of pregnancy in contemporary America, encouraging empathy and advocacy for reform.",
