  "title": "How Our Brain Helps Us See Better",
  "summary": "Scientists at MIT discovered a hidden brain circuit that changes how we see things based on what we are doing. They studied mice and found that parts of the brain called the prefrontal cortex send special signals to areas that handle vision and movement. These signals adjust how the brain processes what we see, depending on how alert the mouse is or if it is moving. For example, when a mouse is more awake, one part of the brain helps it see details better, while another part reduces attention to strong or distracting things. This shows that our actions and feelings can rewrite our vision, helping animals focus on what matters. The research used experiments where mice watched images while running, and scientists recorded brain activity to understand these connections.",

    "This article is about brain science from MIT. Scientists study how the brain works by looking at mice. They found that when mice are awake or moving, their brain sends signals to change how they see things. This helps animals pay attention to important stuff, like food or danger. Brain circuits are like roads in the brain that carry messages. Understanding this can help us learn about human vision and brain diseases."
