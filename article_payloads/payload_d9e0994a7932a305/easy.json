  "title": "A Lab Gets a New Name: What It Means for Energy",
  "summary": "The National Renewable Energy Laboratory in Colorado has been renamed the National Laboratory of the Rockies by the Trump administration. This lab is famous for studying wind, solar, and other clean energy sources. The new name is part of a bigger plan to focus on all types of energy, not just renewable ones. Some people worry this change might mean less support for clean energy research, which could hurt America's ability to compete with countries like China and India. The lab's director says the new name honors the beautiful Rocky Mountains where the lab is located, but he didn't explain how the lab's work will change. This renaming is one of several actions by the government to shift attention away from renewable energy toward fossil fuels like oil and coal.",
