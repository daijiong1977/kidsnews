  "title": "Emergency Meeting About Attacks in Iran",
  "summary": "The Prime Minister of the UK, Sir Keir Starmer, held an emergency meeting called Cobra because the US and Israel attacked Iran with air strikes. Explosions were heard in cities in Iran, including Tehran. The UK did not join these attacks. Iran has fired back with missiles, and explosions have been reported in other countries in the region, causing problems for air travel. The UK government is worried about British people in places like Bahrain, Qatar, and other countries, telling them to stay safe and take shelter. They do not want the fighting to get bigger. The government says Iran should not have nuclear weapons and wants a peaceful solution. This is a serious situation that leaders are trying to handle carefully.",

    "This article is about a recent conflict in the Middle East. Iran is a country that some other countries, like the US and Israel, are worried about because it might be trying to make nuclear weapons, which are very dangerous. When countries disagree, they sometimes use military force like air strikes, which are attacks from the sky. The UK is a country that tries to help keep peace and protect its citizens abroad. An emergency meeting like Cobra is called when something serious happens, so leaders can decide what to do to keep people safe and prevent more fighting."
