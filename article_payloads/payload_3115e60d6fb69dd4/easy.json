  "title": "Forests Are Changing Fast: Why Trees Are Important",
  "summary": "Forests are very important for our planet. Trees help clean the air by absorbing carbon dioxide, provide homes for animals, and give us wood and shade. But scientists are worried because forests are changing quickly. A big study found that forests are becoming more similar, with fewer types of trees, which makes them less strong and healthy. Fast-growing trees are taking over, while slow-growing trees that help keep forests stable are disappearing. This is a problem because slow-growing trees store more carbon and protect forests from things like storms and droughts. The changes are happening because of climate change and people cutting down trees. Scientists say we need to protect forests to keep them diverse and healthy for the future.",

    "Forests are big areas covered with trees and plants that are home to many animals and help our planet by cleaning the air and providing resources like wood. Scientists study forests to understand how they are changing due to things like climate change and human activities. This article talks about a study that shows forests are losing different types of trees, which can make them weaker and less able to handle problems like storms or droughts. Learning about forests helps us know why we should take care of them."
