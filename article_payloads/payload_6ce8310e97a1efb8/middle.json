  "title": "New Dad's Struggle: Learning to Seek Support",
  "summary": "Ryan Libbey, a former Made in Chelsea star, anticipated handling fatherhood with ease, but reality proved challenging. After his partner Louise faced life-threatening health complications during childbirth, Ryan became her primary caregiver while also tending to their newborn son Leo. He managed all nighttime duties, diaper changes, and walks, essentially fulfilling both parental roles. After 11 months, he experienced burnout. A conversation with his father on a park bench was pivotal; his dad's words, 'You need some help,' prompted Ryan to seek support. He realized that societal norms often pressure men to internalize struggles, viewing help-seeking as weakness. Statistics indicate 5-15% of fathers experience anxiety and 5-10% face depression around childbirth, yet these issues are rarely discussed. Ryan advocates for open communication among men, emphasizing that mental well-being is crucial for family health. Clinical psychologist Dr. Jill Domoney notes that men may feel illegitimate in asking for help, but their emotional health is equally important. Ryan's journey highlights the need for dads to prioritize emotions alongside practical tasks.",

    "This article discusses the challenges new dads face, using Ryan Libbey's story as a case study. Fatherhood can be overwhelming, especially when unexpected events like health issues occur. Society often focuses on maternal struggles, but paternal mental health is equally important. Research shows that a significant percentage of fathers experience anxiety and depression, yet they may hesitate to seek help due to cultural expectations of masculinity. Ryan's burnout and subsequent realization highlight the need for better support systems and open conversations among men. Understanding these dynamics can help families thrive by ensuring both parents' well-being is addressed."
