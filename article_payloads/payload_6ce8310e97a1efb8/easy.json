  "title": "A Dad Learns It's Okay to Ask for Help",
  "summary": "Ryan Libbey, a former TV star, thought he could handle being a new dad, but things got tough. His partner had health problems after their baby was born, so Ryan had to take care of her and their son Leo all by himself. He did everything like feeding, changing diapers, and walking the baby, but after 11 months, he felt very tired and sad. One day, his dad talked to him on a park bench and said, 'You need help.' This made Ryan realize it's not weak to ask for help. Many dads feel this way but don't talk about it. Ryan learned that sharing feelings and getting support is important for dads too, so they can be happy and help their families.",
