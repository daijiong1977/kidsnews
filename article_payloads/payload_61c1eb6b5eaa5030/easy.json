  "title": "A Silent Brain Problem Can Make Memory Loss More Likely",
  "summary": "A brain disease called cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA) can make people four times more likely to get dementia, even if they never have a stroke. CAA happens when a protein called amyloid builds up in the blood vessels of the brain, making them weak. This can cause strokes or memory problems. A big study looked at over 1.9 million older adults and found that CAA increases dementia risk more than stroke alone. Doctors say it's important to check for memory changes in people with CAA to help prevent dementia. The study will be shared at a brain health conference in 2026.",

    "Cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA) is a brain disorder where a protein called amyloid collects in blood vessels, making them weak. This can lead to strokes or dementia, which affects memory and thinking. A new study shows that people with CAA are much more likely to develop dementia, even without a stroke. Doctors use this information to screen for cognitive changes and help patients stay healthy. Understanding CAA helps scientists learn more about brain diseases and how to treat them."
