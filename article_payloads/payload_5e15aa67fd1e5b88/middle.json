A former professional bodybuilder and firefighter from Ilkeston, Derbyshire, Jamie has gained popularity on the show since its 2024 return. He explained on Instagram that he lost his original identity at age four when his surname changed, and he later hid behind his physique and a double-barrelled surname.
