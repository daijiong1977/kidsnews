  "title": "Political Symbolism and Institutional Boundaries: Machado's Nobel Medal Transfer to Trump",
  "summary": "In a politically charged gesture, Venezuelan opposition leader María Corina Machado presented her Nobel Peace Prize medal to U.S. President Donald Trump during a White House meeting, characterizing it as a recognition of his commitment to Venezuela's liberation. This act occurred in the aftermath of U.S. military intervention leading to the seizure of Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro on drug-trafficking allegations. Trump publicly acknowledged the gesture as a mark of mutual respect, yet the Nobel committee firmly stated that Nobel Prizes are inherently non-transferable, underscoring a clash between personal symbolism and institutional protocol. Machado, who asserts electoral victory in Venezuela's disputed 2024 polls, has not secured Trump's endorsement as the legitimate leader; instead, U.S. engagement continues with acting head Delcy Rodríguez. Machado's rhetoric invoked a historical analogy to Lafayette's gift to Simón Bolívar, framing the exchange within a narrative of revolutionary solidarity. The committee reiterated that prizes cannot be revoked, shared, or transferred, highlighting the tension between diplomatic maneuvering and the Nobel Foundation's established norms. This event encapsulates broader geopolitical dynamics, including U.S. influence in Latin America and the instrumentalization of awards in international relations.",

    "This article examines a significant diplomatic encounter between Venezuelan opposition figure María Corina Machado and U.S. President Donald Trump, centered on the transfer of a Nobel Peace Prize medal. To fully grasp this, one must understand the historical and political context: Venezuela has been in turmoil under Nicolás Maduro's regime, with widespread protests and international sanctions. The U.S. has actively opposed Maduro, including recent military actions leading to his arrest. Machado, as a Nobel laureate, represents a faction seeking democratic change. The Nobel Peace Prize, established by Alfred Nobel, is a prestigious award with strict institutional rules against transferability, designed to honor individual contributions to peace. This event raises questions about the intersection of personal diplomacy, institutional integrity, and geopolitical strategy, reflecting broader themes of how symbols are leveraged in international relations and the tensions between symbolic acts and formal protocols."
