  "summary": "María Corina Machado, a leader from Venezuela, gave her Nobel Peace Prize medal to President Donald Trump at the White House. She said this was to thank him for helping Venezuela become free. Trump thought it was a nice gesture, but the Nobel committee said the prize cannot be given to someone else. Machado met Trump for the first time after the U.S. took action against Venezuela's president. She told her supporters that they can rely on Trump. The Nobel committee explained that once a prize is given, it stays with the winner forever and cannot be shared or transferred. Machado compared her action to a historical gift between heroes.",
