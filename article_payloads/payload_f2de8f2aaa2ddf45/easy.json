  "title": "What is Project 2025 and How Much Did the Trump Team Do?",
  "summary": "Project 2025 is a big plan made by some people who support former President Donald Trump. It has ideas to change how the government works, like stopping programs that help everyone be treated fairly and removing words about gender and health from rules. Before the election, Trump said he wasn't involved with Project 2025. But now, as the year ends, trackers from groups and unions show that his administration has done about half of the things in the plan. They did this by making executive orders and hiring or firing people to give the president more power. For example, people who helped write Project 2025 now have important jobs in the government, like running budgets or agencies. This shows that even if Trump said he wasn't part of it, his team is using many ideas from the plan to make changes.",

    "Project 2025 is a plan created by supporters of former President Donald Trump to change how the U.S. government works. It includes ideas like stopping programs that promote fairness and removing certain words from rules. Before the election, Trump said he wasn't part of this plan, but his team has been using many of its ideas. They do this by making executive orders, which are rules from the president, and by putting people who support the plan into important jobs. This helps the president have more power over the government. Understanding this helps us see how plans can influence government actions, even if leaders say they aren't involved."
