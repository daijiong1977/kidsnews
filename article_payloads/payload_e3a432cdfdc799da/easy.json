  "title": "Ancient Roman Mosaic Tells a Lost Trojan War Story",
  "summary": "In Britain, a special Roman mosaic was found on a farm during the COVID-19 lockdown. This mosaic is very old, from about 2,000 years ago, and it shows scenes from the Trojan War, a famous ancient battle between Greeks and Trojans. But instead of telling the usual story from Homer's Iliad, it shows a different version from a Greek playwright named Aeschylus, which was mostly forgotten. The mosaic has pictures of Achilles and Hector fighting, and it uses designs that artists from around the Mediterranean Sea shared for centuries. This discovery helps us learn that people in Roman Britain were connected to other parts of the ancient world through art. The mosaic is now protected as an important historical site.",

    "The Trojan War is a famous story from ancient Greece about a long battle between Greek soldiers and the city of Troy. It is often told in Homer's Iliad, but other writers like Aeschylus had different versions. Mosaics are artworks made by arranging small pieces to create pictures, and Romans used them to decorate floors and walls. Roman Britain was part of the Roman Empire long ago, and discoveries like this mosaic help us understand how people lived and shared ideas across different regions."
