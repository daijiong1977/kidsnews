  "title": "President Trump's Big Speech About America",
  "summary": "President Donald Trump gave a speech called the State of the Union. He talked about the economy, saying it is doing very well with lower prices for things like gas and medicine. He also praised the U.S. Olympic hockey team and a war hero. But many Americans feel worried about money and don't think Trump's policies have helped them. Polls show that only 39% of people approve of how he handles the economy. Trump also made fun of Democrats in his speech. Republicans wanted him to focus on the economy because elections are coming up. The speech had a happy start but turned more serious later.",
