  "title": "Analyzing Trump's Evolving Peace Plan for Ukraine",
  "summary": "President Donald Trump has proposed a U.S. peace plan to end the war in Ukraine, but he emphasized it is not his final offer, indicating potential flexibility. The plan, which includes 28 points, suggests Ukraine cede territory to Russia, reduce its military size, and forgo NATO membership, aligning with many Russian demands. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and European allies like France, Germany, and the U.K. have expressed alarm, arguing that the plan could undermine Ukraine's sovereignty and security. In response, European leaders issued a joint statement stressing that borders should not be changed by force and that Ukraine needs robust guarantees against future attacks. A meeting is scheduled in Geneva with U.S. and Ukrainian delegations, joined by European envoys, to discuss the proposal. While the U.S. aims for a swift end to the conflict, European powers insist on a sustainable peace that involves broader consultation and respects Ukraine's rights, highlighting tensions in international diplomacy over how to achieve lasting stability.",

    "The Russia-Ukraine war began with Russia's full-scale invasion in 2022, following years of tension. Ukraine has received support from Western allies who view the conflict as a threat to international order and sovereignty. NATO and the EU have provided aid and sanctions against Russia. Peace efforts have been complex, with debates over territorial integrity and security. The U.S. under Trump has pursued a more unilateral approach, while European nations emphasize multilateral solutions and the importance of not rewarding aggression. Understanding this context helps explain the current diplomatic tensions and the stakes for Ukraine's future."
