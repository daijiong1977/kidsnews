  "title": "Trump's Peace Plan for Ukraine",
  "summary": "President Trump has a plan to help end the war between Ukraine and Russia. He says it is not his final offer, meaning he might change it. Ukraine's leader, Zelenskyy, wants to defend his country and is worried about the plan. The plan asks Ukraine to give some land to Russia and not join a group called NATO. Other countries like France and Germany are helping Ukraine and want to make sure any peace is fair. They believe borders should not be changed by force. Leaders from Europe and the U.S. will meet to talk about the plan. Everyone hopes for peace, but they want it to be safe and lasting for Ukraine.",
