  "summary": "President Trump has a plan to help end the war between Ukraine and Russia. He says it is not his final offer, meaning he might change it. Ukraine's leader, Zelenskyy, wants to defend his country and is talking with other countries like France and Germany. The plan asks Ukraine to give some land to Russia and not join a group called NATO. Other countries are worried because they think Ukraine should be able to protect itself. They are meeting to discuss the plan and make sure peace is fair for everyone.",
