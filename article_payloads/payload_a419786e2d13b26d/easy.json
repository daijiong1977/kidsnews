  "title": "Army Stops Using Ajax Vehicles After Soldiers Get Sick",
  "summary": "The British Army has stopped using its Ajax armored vehicles because some soldiers got sick from loud noise and strong shaking during a training exercise. About 30 soldiers felt unwell, with some vomiting or shaking after being in the vehicles. The Ministry of Defence is investigating to make sure everyone is safe. These vehicles are part of a big program that cost billions of pounds and were made in Wales. The Army will not use them for training for two weeks while they check what went wrong. This has happened before, as noise and vibration have hurt soldiers in the past. The goal is to fix the problems so the vehicles can be used safely in the future.",

    "The Ajax program is a project to build armored vehicles for the British Army. These vehicles are designed to protect soldiers and help in battles. They have faced problems with noise and vibration before, which can make people feel sick. The Army is careful to keep soldiers safe, so they stop using things if there's a risk. This helps everyone understand why it's important to check equipment before using it."
