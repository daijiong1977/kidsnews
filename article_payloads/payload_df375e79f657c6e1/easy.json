  "title": "A Judge Says Following Orders Isn't Always a Good Excuse",
  "summary": "A judge in the United States said that President Trump's order to stop wind power projects was not a good reason. Wind power helps make electricity from wind, and it is important for the environment. The judge ruled that the government cannot just say \"because Trump said to\" as a defense. This means the government needs a better explanation for stopping wind projects. The order had paused many wind projects on land and in the ocean. States and companies sued because they wanted the projects to continue. The judge decided that the government's actions were unfair and not based on good reasons. Now, the government might still slow down the projects, but this ruling helps people who want wind power to have a stronger case in court. Wind power is clean energy that helps fight climate change.",

    "Wind power is a type of clean energy that uses wind to make electricity. It helps reduce pollution and fight climate change. In the United States, the government sometimes makes rules about energy projects. When a president gives an order, like stopping wind projects, people can go to court if they think it's unfair. Judges decide if the order is based on good reasons or if it's just arbitrary, meaning without a good explanation. This case shows that even presidents' orders must have clear reasons to be legal."
