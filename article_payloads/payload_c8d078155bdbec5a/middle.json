  "title": "Predicting Oscar Nominations: Key Contenders and Trends",
  "summary": "The Oscar nominations are set to be announced today, with expectations high for films like One Battle After Another, a political thriller starring Leonardo DiCaprio, and Sinners, a vampire horror featuring Wunmi Mosaku. Other notable contenders include Hamnet, adapted from Maggie O'Farrell's novel, with Irish actors Jessie Buckley and Paul Mescal likely to receive acting nominations. The ceremony, hosted by Conan O'Brien on March 15, will reveal the nominees. However, blockbusters such as Wicked: For Good and Avatar: Fire and Ash may see fewer nominations due to mixed reviews and franchise fatigue, as noted by director James Cameron's comments on Oscar campaigning. British talent faces a weaker year, with only a few actors like Cynthia Erivo and Emily Blunt from the Golden Globes, but Wunmi Mosaku remains a hope. In contrast, Irish talent is strong, potentially marking a shift in international representation at the Oscars.",
