  "title": "A Mystery in Our Galaxy's Invisible Force",
  "summary": "Scientists are studying something invisible in our galaxy, the Milky Way, called a magnetic field. This magnetic field helps hold the galaxy together so it doesn't collapse. Dr. Jo-Anne Brown and her team used a special radio telescope in Canada to look at the sky and learn about this magnetic field. They found that in one part of the galaxy, called the Sagittarius Arm, the magnetic field goes the opposite way compared to the rest of the galaxy. This is strange and exciting because it helps us understand how the galaxy works and changes over time. The team shared their data so other scientists can use it to make better models of the galaxy.",
