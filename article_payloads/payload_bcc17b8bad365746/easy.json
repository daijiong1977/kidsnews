  "title": "Why Greenland Matters to Countries Like the U.S.",
  "summary": "This article talks about Greenland, a big island near the Arctic. The U.S. president, Donald Trump, has said he might try to take control of Greenland because he thinks it is important for safety. He worries that other countries like Russia or China could try to take it over. Greenland is part of Denmark, a country in Europe, and Denmark does not want to give it up. Leaders from Denmark and Greenland met with U.S. leaders to talk about this, but they did not agree. A group called NATO, which includes many countries working together for safety, is also concerned about this situation. An expert named Rob Bauer, who used to lead part of NATO, explains why Greenland is so important for security and why this is a big deal for everyone involved.",

    "Greenland is a large, icy island located between the Arctic and Atlantic Oceans. It is an autonomous territory of Denmark, meaning it governs itself but is still connected to Denmark. Countries like the U.S., Russia, and China are interested in Greenland because it has resources and is in a strategic location for military and shipping routes. NATO is an alliance formed after World War II to protect member countries from threats. Understanding these basics helps explain why there is tension over Greenland's control."
