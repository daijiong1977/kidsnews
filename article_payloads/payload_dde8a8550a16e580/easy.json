  "title": "President Trump Stops Wind Farms on the East Coast",
  "summary": "President Trump has stopped five big wind farms from being built in the ocean near the East Coast. The government says the wind turbines might cause problems for radar signals used by the military to keep the country safe. This is not the first time the Trump administration has tried to slow down wind power projects. Some of these wind farms were already starting to work, and people in the states and companies are sad and frustrated because they wanted clean energy from the wind. Wind power helps make electricity without pollution, but now these projects are on hold. This decision affects jobs and the environment, and it shows a big debate about using renewable energy like wind instead of fossil fuels.",

    "Wind power is a way to make electricity using wind turbines, which are big fans that spin in the wind. It is a clean energy source because it doesn't burn fossil fuels like coal or oil, so it helps reduce pollution and fight climate change. The East Coast of the United States has strong winds over the ocean, making it a good place for offshore wind farms. The government sometimes makes decisions about energy projects to balance things like safety, jobs, and the environment. In this case, the Trump administration is concerned about how wind turbines might affect military radar, which is used to protect the country."
