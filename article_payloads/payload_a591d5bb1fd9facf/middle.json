  "title": "Raducanu's Disappointing Loss in Transylvania Open Final",
  "summary": "Emma Raducanu, the British number one and top seed, suffered a heavy defeat in the Transylvania Open final, losing to Romanian Sorana Cirstea with a score of 6-0 6-2. Raducanu managed only two games in the match, held in Cluj-Napoca, Romania, marking a setback in her quest for a first title since her 2021 US Open win. The loss was attributed to Raducanu's fatigue from a grueling three-hour semi-final the previous day and a chest infection, which left her lacking energy. Cirstea, aged 35 and in her final career year, capitalized on this, playing sharply to claim her fourth WTA Tour title. Raducanu expressed disappointment but emphasized gratitude for reaching the final after a long hiatus. The article highlights the physical demands of professional tennis and the challenges athletes face in back-to-back matches.",
