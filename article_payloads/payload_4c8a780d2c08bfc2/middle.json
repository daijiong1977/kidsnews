  "title": "Decoding Mitraphylline: How Scientists Unlocked a Plant's Cancer-Fighting Secrets",
  "summary": "Researchers at UBC Okanagan have decoded the process by which plants produce mitraphylline, a rare spirooxindole alkaloid with significant anti-cancer and anti-inflammatory properties. Mitraphylline belongs to a unique family of plant chemicals characterized by twisted ring structures that enhance their biological effects. For years, the molecular assembly of these compounds remained a mystery. In 2023, Dr. Thu-Thuy Dang's team identified the first plant enzyme capable of forming the spiro shape. Building on this, doctoral student Tuan-Anh Nguyen led research to pinpoint two key enzymes: one that arranges mitraphylline into its correct three-dimensional structure and another that twists it into its final form. This discovery, likened to finding missing links in an assembly line, answers fundamental questions about natural product biosynthesis. Mitraphylline is challenging to obtain because it exists only in trace amounts in tropical trees like Mitragyna (kratom) and Uncaria (cat's claw). By understanding the enzymatic pathways, scientists can now replicate the production of mitraphylline using sustainable, green chemistry methods, making it more accessible for pharmaceutical development. The project involved collaboration between UBC Okanagan and the University of Florida, highlighting the importance of teamwork in advancing global health solutions.",
