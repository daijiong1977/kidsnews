  "title": "Scientists Discover How Plants Make a Special Cancer-Fighting Chemical",
  "summary": "Scientists at UBC Okanagan have solved a big mystery about how plants make a rare chemical called mitraphylline that can help fight cancer. Mitraphylline is part of a special group of plant chemicals with twisted shapes that give them strong effects against tumors and inflammation. For a long time, no one knew how plants built these chemicals. In 2023, researchers found the first plant enzyme that makes the twisted shape. Now, a student named Tuan-Anh Nguyen led new work to find two key enzymes that help make mitraphylline. One enzyme arranges the molecule into the right 3D structure, and another twists it into its final form. This discovery is like finding missing links in an assembly line, helping scientists understand how nature creates these complex molecules. Mitraphylline is hard to get because it only exists in tiny amounts in tropical trees like kratom and cat's claw. By knowing the enzymes, scientists can now make mitraphylline in a greener and more sustainable way, which could lead to new medicines. The work was a team effort between UBC Okanagan and the University of Florida.",
