    "This article is about two big companies, Netflix and Paramount, both wanting to buy Warner Bros, which is a famous movie and TV studio. Netflix is a streaming service that people use to watch shows online, and Warner Bros makes popular movies and series. When companies try to buy each other, it's called a takeover bid. Netflix's boss argues that their offer is better because it will help the movie industry grow by adding new content, while Paramount's offer might reduce the number of studios. This is important because it affects what movies and shows we can watch in the future."
