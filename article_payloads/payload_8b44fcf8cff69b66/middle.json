  "title": "Uncovering Hidden Tectonic Structures with Micro-Earthquakes in California",
  "summary": "Researchers are analyzing swarms of extremely small, low-frequency earthquakes to gain insights into a complex and hazardous region off Northern California's coast, where the San Andreas fault meets the Cascadia subduction zone. This area, known as the Mendocino Triple Junction, involves the convergence of tectonic plates and can generate powerful earthquakes. Scientists from the U.S. Geological Survey, UC Davis, and the University of Colorado Boulder used a dense network of seismometers to detect these tiny earthquakes, which are thousands of times weaker than perceptible ones. They tested their model by observing how the earthquakes respond to tidal forces, similar to ocean tides. The study revealed that the region comprises five moving pieces, not just three major plates, including a broken portion of the North American plate being dragged down with the Gorda plate and the Pioneer fragment—a mass of rock from the ancient Farallon plate—being pulled beneath North America. This research, published in Science, aims to improve earthquake prediction and hazard assessment by understanding underlying tectonic processes.",

    "Tectonic plates are large pieces of Earth's crust that move slowly, leading to earthquakes and volcanic activity. In California, the San Andreas fault is a major boundary where plates slide past each other, while the Cascadia subduction zone involves one plate sinking beneath another. The Mendocino Triple Junction is a complex area where these systems meet, posing significant earthquake risks. Scientists use advanced tools like seismometers to study small earthquakes and understand hidden geological structures, aiming to enhance public safety through better prediction models."
