  "title": "Tiny Earthquakes Show Hidden Dangers Under California",
  "summary": "Scientists are using tiny earthquakes to learn about a dangerous area off the coast of Northern California. This place is where two big earthquake zones meet: the San Andreas fault and the Cascadia subduction zone. It can cause very strong earthquakes. Researchers from the U.S. Geological Survey and universities studied small earthquakes that people cannot feel. They found that there are five moving pieces under the ground, not just three plates. One piece is called the Pioneer fragment, which is being pulled under North America. This helps scientists understand how earthquakes happen and predict future dangers. The study was published in a science journal.",
