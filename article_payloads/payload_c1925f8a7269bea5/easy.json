  "title": "A Wheelchair User Goes to Space for the First Time",
  "summary": "A German engineer named Michaela Benthaus became the first person in a wheelchair to go to space. She flew on a rocket from Texas with five other people. Michaela had a bike accident seven years ago and uses a wheelchair, but she left it behind to float in space. The rocket, called New Shepard, was made by a company called Blue Origin. It flew over 65 miles high for about 10 minutes. The company made small changes to help Michaela, like adding a board to move into her seat. After landing, she got back to her wheelchair right away. Michaela was very happy and said it was a cool experience. This shows that more people, including those with disabilities, can dream of going to space.",
