  "title": "Breaking Barriers: First Wheelchair User Reaches Space",
  "summary": "Michaela Benthaus, a 33-year-old paraplegic engineer from Germany, made history by becoming the first wheelchair user to travel to space. On December 20, 2025, she launched from West Texas aboard Blue Origin's New Shepard rocket, accompanied by five other passengers, including retired SpaceX executive Hans Koenigsmann, who helped organize and sponsor her trip. The flight lasted about 10 minutes, reaching over 65 miles in altitude, where Benthaus experienced weightlessness and floated freely, leaving her wheelchair behind. Blue Origin made minor adjustments to accommodate her, such as adding a patient transfer board for easier access to the capsule seat and providing a carpet for immediate wheelchair retrieval after landing. Benthaus, who was injured in a mountain bike accident seven years ago, is part of the European Space Agency's graduate trainee program and had prior experience with weightlessness during parabolic flights. This milestone demonstrates advancements in accessible space tourism, as Blue Origin has previously flown individuals with various disabilities, aiming to make spaceflight more inclusive. Benthaus expressed joy and described the experience as transformative, highlighting how technology and determination can overcome physical limitations.",
