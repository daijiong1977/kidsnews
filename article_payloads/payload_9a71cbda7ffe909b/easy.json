  "title": "Scientists Find Hidden Switches in Our DNA That Help Fight Alzheimer's Disease",
  "summary": "Our DNA is like a big instruction book for our bodies, but only a tiny part of it, about 2%, contains genes that tell our cells what to do. The rest, called 'junk DNA,' was thought to be useless, but scientists have discovered it has important switches that control genes. Researchers from UNSW Sydney studied brain cells called astrocytes, which help neurons and are linked to Alzheimer's disease. They tested nearly 1000 DNA switches, called enhancers, in lab-grown astrocytes and found about 150 that work. These enhancers turn genes on or off, and many of them control genes related to Alzheimer's. This discovery helps scientists understand how Alzheimer's develops and could lead to new treatments by focusing on these hidden switches in our DNA.",

    "DNA is like a blueprint inside every cell of our bodies, telling them how to grow and function. Only a small part, called genes, gives direct instructions, while the rest, once called 'junk DNA,' actually has switches that control when genes turn on or off. Scientists from UNSW Sydney studied brain cells called astrocytes, which help nerve cells and are involved in Alzheimer's disease, a condition that affects memory in older people. By testing DNA switches in these cells, they found many that control genes related to Alzheimer's, helping us understand the disease better and potentially leading to new treatments."
