  "title": "Unlocking the Secrets of Non-Coding DNA: How Enhancers in Astrocytes Connect to Alzheimer's Disease",
  "summary": "DNA consists of genes that code for proteins, but they make up only about 2% of the human genome. The remaining 98%, often termed 'junk DNA' or the non-coding genome, includes regulatory elements like enhancers that control gene expression without coding for proteins themselves. Researchers from UNSW Sydney focused on astrocytes, supportive brain cells implicated in Alzheimer's disease, to investigate these enhancers. Using advanced techniques such as CRISPRi and single-cell RNA sequencing, they tested nearly 1000 potential enhancers in lab-grown human astrocytes. CRISPRi allowed them to deactivate specific DNA segments without cutting, while single-cell RNA sequencing measured gene activity at the cellular level. The study identified approximately 150 functional enhancers that influence gene expression, with a significant portion regulating genes associated with Alzheimer's. This discovery narrows the search for genetic factors in the non-coding genome related to the disease. The findings also provide a valuable reference for interpreting genetic studies on other conditions like hypertension and diabetes, where changes often occur in non-coding regions. Overall, this research highlights the importance of non-coding DNA in disease mechanisms and suggests that similar studies in other cell types could further elucidate the functional landscape of the genome.",

    "DNA is divided into coding regions (genes) and non-coding regions, with genes making up only about 2% of the human genome. The non-coding portion, once dismissed as 'junk DNA,' includes regulatory elements like enhancers that control when and how genes are expressed. Enhancers can be located far from the genes they regulate, making them challenging to study. In this research, scientists from UNSW Sydney investigated enhancers in astrocytes, brain cells that support neurons and are linked to Alzheimer's disease. They used CRISPRi, a technique to deactivate DNA segments, and single-cell RNA sequencing to measure gene activity, allowing them to test nearly 1000 enhancers at once. The study identified functional enhancers that influence genes associated with Alzheimer's, providing insights into the disease's genetic basis. This work underscores the significance of non-coding DNA in health and disease, suggesting that similar approaches could be applied to other cell types and conditions."
