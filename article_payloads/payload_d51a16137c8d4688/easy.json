  "title": "Exercise Makes You Burn More Energy All Day",
  "summary": "A new study shows that when you exercise, your body uses more energy throughout the whole day without cutting back on other important tasks. Scientists from Virginia Tech and other universities worked together to learn about how physical activity affects our energy budget, which is like how our body spends energy on different jobs. They studied 75 people of different ages and activity levels, from not very active to ultra-runners. The participants wore sensors to track movement and drank special water to measure calories burned. The results found that moving more leads to burning more calories, and the body doesn't reduce energy used for things like breathing or keeping warm. This means exercise helps you use extra energy without your body canceling it out, which is good news for staying healthy.",

    "This article is about a science study that looks at how exercise affects our body's energy use. Scientists wanted to know if moving more makes us burn more calories all day, or if the body saves energy elsewhere to make up for it. They tested people with different activity levels and found that exercise increases total energy use without cutting back on other functions. This helps us understand why physical activity is important for health, as it doesn't get canceled out by the body."
