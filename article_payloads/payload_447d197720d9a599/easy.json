  "title": "Tiny Yeast Survives Mars-Like Conditions",
  "summary": "Scientists have discovered that baker's yeast, a tiny organism used in baking, can survive in conditions similar to Mars. Researchers from India tested yeast by exposing it to powerful shock waves like those from meteorite impacts and toxic salts found in Martian soil. They used a special machine called HISTA to create the shock waves. Even under these harsh conditions, the yeast stayed alive, though it grew slower. The yeast survived because it forms tiny structures inside its cells called RNP condensates, which help protect it from stress. This finding is important because it shows that simple life forms might be able to live in extreme places like Mars, helping scientists search for life beyond Earth.",

    "Baker's yeast is a common microorganism found in kitchens, used to make bread rise and beer ferment. Mars is the fourth planet from the sun, known for its cold, dry, and dusty environment with toxic chemicals in the soil. Scientists study extreme conditions to understand if life could exist on other planets, which is part of astrobiology, the science of life in space."
