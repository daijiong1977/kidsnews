  "title": "Cheese and Cream Might Help Keep Your Brain Healthy",
  "summary": "A new study from Sweden found that eating full-fat cheese and cream might help lower the chance of getting dementia when people get older. Dementia is a condition that makes it hard to remember things and think clearly. The study looked at over 27,000 adults for about 25 years. People who ate more high-fat cheese, like cheddar or Brie, had a 13% lower risk of dementia. Those who ate high-fat cream, like whipping cream, had a 16% lower risk. The study does not prove that these foods prevent dementia, but it shows a link. Researchers think this challenges old ideas that high-fat foods are always bad for health. They used food diaries and questions to track what people ate. The study was published in a medical journal called Neurology.",

    "Dementia is a health problem that often affects older people, making it difficult for them to remember things, communicate, or do daily tasks. It can be caused by diseases like Alzheimer's. Foods we eat can impact our brain health. Full-fat dairy products, such as cheese and cream, have been debated for years—some people think they are unhealthy because of their fat content, but this study suggests they might have benefits for the brain. Scientists do studies like this to learn how diet affects our health over time."
