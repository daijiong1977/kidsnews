  "title": "A Secret Report About a Big Dump Fire Danger",
  "summary": "In England, there is a big illegal waste dump in Kidlington, Oxfordshire, that has a high risk of catching fire. The Environment Agency spent over £9 million to clear this dump because a secret fire risk report said it was very dangerous. This report could close a major highway and affect electricity supplies. Local people and campaigners want to see the report to understand why this dump was cleared while other big dumps with similar fire risks are not being cleaned up. However, the Oxfordshire Fire and Rescue Service will not share the report, saying it might put public safety at risk. They worry that if people know the details, it could help criminals or cause more problems. Some people, like Baroness Sheehan, think the report should be made public so everyone can know about the dangers. The BBC found there are over 500 illegal dumps in England, and people are concerned about fire risks at these places too.",

    "In England, illegal waste dumps are places where trash is piled up without permission. These dumps can be dangerous because they might catch fire, pollute the environment, or harm people's health. The Environment Agency is responsible for cleaning up such sites to protect everyone. Sometimes, reports are written to assess risks, but they might be kept secret if sharing them could cause more problems. People who live near dumps often worry about safety and want information to stay safe."
