  "title": "Starmer Denies Authorizing Attacks in Leadership Dispute",
  "summary": "In a recent political story, Keir Starmer, the leader of the Labour Party, said he did not give permission for any attacks on other government ministers. This happened after a disagreement within his party. Kemi Badenoch, who leads the Conservative Party, accused Starmer of having a 'toxic' environment in his office. The article explains that politicians sometimes argue about how things are run, and Starmer wants to show he is not involved in negative behavior. It's important to understand that leaders must be honest and work together for the country. This helps us learn about responsibility in politics.",
