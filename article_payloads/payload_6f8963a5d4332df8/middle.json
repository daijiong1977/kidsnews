  "title": "Trump Rejects Nuclear Arms Treaty Extension Amid Global Tensions",
  "summary": "President Trump declined Russia's proposal to temporarily extend the New START treaty, which imposed caps on strategic nuclear weapons and expired today. Trump criticized the treaty as poorly negotiated and advocated for a new, modernized agreement developed by U.S. nuclear experts. The Kremlin expressed regret over the expiration, marking the end of the last remaining nuclear arms pact between the U.S. and Russia. A United Nations spokesperson highlighted the gravity of the situation, noting it's the first time in over 50 years without binding limits on the strategic arsenals of both nations. Concurrently, the U.S. and Russia agreed to restart high-level military communications, which had been suspended since 2021 due to rising tensions before Russia's invasion of Ukraine. This move aims to increase transparency and de-escalation. Additionally, Ukraine and Russia concluded a second day of U.S.-brokered talks in Abu Dhabi, described as constructive, with plans for future discussions. Trump has also pushed for China's inclusion in a potential new treaty, though China has resisted this idea.",

    "The New START treaty, signed in 2010, was a key arms control agreement between the United States and Russia, limiting deployed strategic nuclear warheads and delivery systems. Its expiration raises concerns about a new arms race, as nuclear weapons pose existential threats to global security. The United Nations often mediates in such disputes to prevent conflict. Tensions between the U.S. and Russia have been high, especially since Russia's 2022 invasion of Ukraine, leading to suspended diplomatic and military channels. Talks like those in Abu Dhabi are part of international efforts to resolve the Ukraine conflict, with the U.S. acting as a broker. Involving China in nuclear treaties is complex due to geopolitical rivalries and China's growing military capabilities."
