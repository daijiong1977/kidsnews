  "title": "Trump Says No to Nuclear Treaty with Russia",
  "summary": "President Trump said no to Russia's offer to keep a nuclear weapons treaty going for a little longer. This treaty, called New START, stopped the U.S. and Russia from having too many nuclear weapons, but it ended today. Trump thinks the old deal was not good and wants to make a new one with help from nuclear experts. The United Nations is worried because now there are no rules to limit nuclear weapons between these two countries for the first time in over 50 years. At the same time, the U.S. and Russia agreed to start talking again through military channels to help avoid problems, and Ukraine and Russia finished two days of talks in Abu Dhabi, which they said were good. Trump also wants China to join a new treaty, but China does not want to.",

    "Nuclear weapons are very dangerous bombs that countries use for defense. Treaties like New START help countries agree not to have too many, so the world is safer. The United Nations is an organization that tries to keep peace between countries. When treaties expire, it can lead to more weapons and tension. Talks between countries, like those in Abu Dhabi, are important to solve disagreements without fighting."
