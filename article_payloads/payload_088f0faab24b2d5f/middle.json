  "title": "Winter Storm Disrupts Power and Travel Across Southern U.S.",
  "summary": "A widespread winter storm impacted much of the United States on Sunday, delivering sleet, freezing rain, and snow that led to subzero temperatures and halted air and road traffic. The storm's effects were particularly severe in the Southeast, where ice accumulation caused tree branches and power lines to snap, resulting in hundreds of thousands of customers losing electricity. The National Weather Service forecasted continued ice and snowfall into Monday, warning of \"dangerous travel and infrastructure impacts\" that could persist for days due to very low temperatures. Meteorologist Allison Santorelli described the storm as unique for its extensive reach, affecting areas from New Mexico to New England over approximately 2,000 miles. In response, President Donald Trump approved emergency declarations for at least a dozen states by Saturday, with the Federal Emergency Management Agency pre-positioning rescue teams and supplies. Record-breaking cold was reported in New York near the Canadian border, while in Mississippi, businesses like Caterpillar advised employees to stay home, and residents shared experiences of unsettling sounds from breaking trees on social media. The storm disrupted daily activities, such as canceled play dates and limited driving, highlighting its broad societal impact.",

    "Winter storms in the United States can arise from complex weather systems that bring mixed precipitation like sleet, freezing rain, and snow, often leading to hazardous conditions. These events are monitored by agencies such as the National Weather Service, which uses meteorology to issue warnings and forecasts. When storms cause significant damage, like power outages from ice-laden trees and lines, emergency management becomes crucial. The Federal Emergency Management Agency plays a key role in coordinating federal response, including pre-positioning resources and supporting state efforts under emergency declarations approved by the President. Historically, such storms have highlighted vulnerabilities in infrastructure, such as power grids and transportation networks, prompting discussions on resilience and preparedness. Understanding these dynamics helps middle school students grasp how weather impacts society and the importance of scientific and governmental responses in mitigating risks."
