  "title": "Big Winter Storm Causes Power Outages in the South",
  "summary": "A huge winter storm hit many parts of the United States on Sunday, bringing ice, snow, and very cold weather. The storm stretched from New Mexico to New England, covering about 2,000 miles. Tree branches and power lines broke because of the heavy ice, leaving hundreds of thousands of homes and businesses without electricity in the Southeast. The National Weather Service warned that the ice and snow could continue into Monday, making travel dangerous and causing problems for roads and buildings. President Donald Trump approved emergency help for at least a dozen states, and rescue teams were ready to assist. In places like New York and Mississippi, people stayed home to stay safe, with some areas seeing record-breaking cold temperatures. The storm affected many people's daily lives, like canceling play dates and work.",

    "Winter storms are big weather events that happen in cold months, bringing snow, ice, and freezing temperatures. They can cause problems like power outages when ice weighs down power lines and trees, making them snap. In the U.S., agencies like the National Weather Service monitor storms and issue warnings to keep people safe. During emergencies, the government can declare states of emergency to send help, such as rescue teams and supplies. Storms like this one affect daily life by closing schools, canceling events, and making travel risky, so it's important for people to stay indoors and follow safety advice."
