  "title": "Contactless Card Limits Can Change Soon",
  "summary": "Starting in March, banks and card companies can let people set their own limits for contactless card payments or even have no limit at all. This means you might be able to pay more than £100 with just a tap of your card, without needing to type a PIN. The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), a group that makes rules for money, says banks should allow customers to choose their own limits or turn off contactless if they want. Some banks already do this. Contactless cards have had different limits over the years, starting at £10 in 2007 and going up to £100 in 2021. People like using contactless because it's fast, but there are worries about thieves stealing cards. The FCA says banks will still protect customers from fraud, so if someone steals your money, you can get it back. They want to give banks more flexibility to set limits based on how safe they think it is.",

    "Contactless cards let you pay by tapping them on a machine without typing a secret code called a PIN. This makes shopping quicker. Over time, the amount you can pay with a tap has increased from £10 to £100. Now, rules are changing so banks can let customers choose their own limits or even have no limit, starting in March. The FCA is a group that helps keep money safe and makes sure banks follow rules. They want to give banks more choice to set limits based on how safe they think payments are, while still protecting people from fraud where thieves might steal money."
