  "title": "New Rules Allow Flexible Contactless Card Limits from March",
  "summary": "From March, banks and card providers will have the authority to set maximum or unlimited single payment amounts for contactless cards, eliminating the need for a PIN in many cases. The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) is encouraging these institutions to allow cardholders to customize their own limits or disable contactless payments entirely, a feature some banks already offer. This regulatory shift occurs despite surveys indicating limited consumer and industry demand for changes to the current £100 limit. Contactless payment limits have evolved significantly since their 2007 introduction, starting at £10 and gradually increasing to £100 by 2021, with jumps during the Covid pandemic. While contactless cards are capped at £100, smartphone payments can bypass PIN requirements entirely, leveraging biometric security like thumbprints and face ID. Concerns about increased fraud risk with higher limits persist, but existing protections include PIN prompts after multiple transactions and fraud reimbursement guarantees. The FCA aims to enhance payment efficiency by granting banks flexibility to assess fraud risks and set appropriate limits, balancing security with consumer convenience in a system where contactless is the preferred payment method.",

    "Contactless card payments, introduced in the UK in 2007, allow transactions by tapping a card on a terminal, initially with a £10 limit that has risen over time to £100. The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) regulates financial services to protect consumers and ensure fair markets. In March, new rules will enable banks and card providers to set flexible or unlimited contactless limits, responding to technological advances and consumer habits. Despite low demand for change, the FCA promotes customization options for cardholders to enhance convenience. Fraud concerns are addressed through existing safeguards like PIN prompts and reimbursement policies. This shift reflects a balance between innovation in digital payments and security measures, as contactless methods become increasingly popular for their speed and ease."
