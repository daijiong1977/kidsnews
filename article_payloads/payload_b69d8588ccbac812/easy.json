  "title": "Your Rights When Meeting ICE Officers",
  "summary": "This article talks about what happens when people meet ICE officers, who are part of the government and work on immigration. ICE officers can stop and ask questions, but everyone has rights from the Constitution, which is like a big rulebook for the country. The Fourth Amendment is a rule that says officers cannot search or take people without a good reason. For example, in public places, officers can talk to you, but if they want to hold you for a short time, they need a 'reasonable suspicion,' which means they must think you did something wrong based on facts, not just a guess. The article shares stories from Minneapolis where ICE officers stopped people, including a grandpa and a dad, causing confusion and protests. Legal experts explain that even if someone might be in the U.S. without permission, they still have these rights. It's important to know your rights to stay safe and fair.",

    "This article is about ICE, which is part of the U.S. government and deals with immigration. Immigration means people moving to live in a new country. Sometimes, ICE officers stop people to check if they are following immigration rules. The Constitution is a very important document that gives rights to all people in the U.S., like the right to be safe from unfair treatment. The Fourth Amendment is one part of the Constitution that helps protect people when officers want to search or detain them. In Minneapolis, there were incidents where ICE officers stopped residents, leading to protests because people were confused about what ICE can do. Legal experts, who are lawyers and professors, explain that even if someone might not have permission to be in the U.S., they still have rights. Knowing these rights can help people understand how to act if they meet ICE officers."
