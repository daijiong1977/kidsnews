  "title": "Judge Helps British Man Stay in the US",
  "summary": "A US judge has stopped the detention of Imran Ahmed, a British man who lives in America. Imran works to fight hate online and keep children safe on social media. The US government wanted to detain him and maybe send him back to Britain because they didn't like his work. Imran is married to an American woman and has a child, so he didn't want to leave his family. The judge said Imran can stay in the US for now while his case is heard in court. This happened after some US officials accused Imran and others of trying to make social media companies censor free speech. Imran says he won't be bullied and will keep doing his important work.",
