  "title": "Bringing Back Sea Plants to Help Our Coasts",
  "summary": "A big project is working to bring back seagrass, a special saltwater plant, to the Humber Estuary in England. Seagrass is very important because it helps fight climate change by capturing carbon from the air faster than rainforests. It also protects coastlines from storms and erosion, keeping beaches and homes safe. In the past, seagrass covered over 1,000 acres here, but it got smaller due to pollution and other problems. Now, scientists are planting seagrass again using different methods, like putting seeds into the seabed. They found that this helps the seagrass grow well. The project is supported by a company that makes renewable energy. Bringing back seagrass helps wildlife like fish and birds, and makes the water cleaner for everyone.",

    "Seagrass is a plant that grows underwater in salty places like estuaries. It used to be common in many areas but has disappeared because of human activities like pollution. Projects like this one in England aim to bring it back to help the environment and protect coastal areas. Learning about seagrass can show how small actions, like planting, can make a big difference for our planet and wildlife."
