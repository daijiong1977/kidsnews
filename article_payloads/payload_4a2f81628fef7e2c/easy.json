  "title": "Storm Chandra Causes Floods and Travel Problems",
  "summary": "Storm Chandra is a big storm that brought heavy rain and wind to the UK. It has caused flooding in many places, with over 200 flood alerts and warnings. In Dorset, people had to leave their homes quickly because the flooding could be dangerous. In Somerset, about 50 homes were flooded, and schools and roads are closed. The storm came after another storm, so the ground was already wet, making flooding worse. Trains and travel are affected until Friday. Emergency workers are helping people stay safe.",

    "Storms are weather events with strong winds and heavy rain that can cause problems like flooding. Floods happen when water covers land that is usually dry, and they can damage homes and make travel hard. In the UK, the Environment Agency issues warnings to keep people safe. Evacuation means leaving a place to avoid danger, and emergency services help during such events."
