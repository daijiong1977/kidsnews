  "title": "New Money for Country Hospitals",
  "summary": "The government is giving $10 billion to help hospitals in rural areas next year. This money is part of a bigger plan to put $50 billion into rural health over five years. Each state will get some money, but not all states will get the same amount. The money is meant to help after budget cuts to rural hospitals. States can decide how to use the money, but they must follow some rules. For example, some money depends on states doing things like teaching nutrition in schools or not allowing certain foods to be bought with food stamps. Critics worry that if states don't follow the rules, they might lose the money. Officials say this program encourages states to be creative with their health plans.",

    "Rural areas often have fewer hospitals and doctors than cities, making it hard for people to get medical care. The government sometimes gives money to help, but it can come with conditions. This article talks about new funding to support rural hospitals, but it has rules that states must follow, which can be controversial."
