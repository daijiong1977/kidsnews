  "title": "Europe Learns to Protect Itself in a Changing World",
  "summary": "In Munich, Germany, people are seeing posters for drones and new military technology, which is unusual because Europe used to feel safer. Now, many Europeans worry about threats from countries like Russia and China, and even the United States is acting differently. Germany is helping Ukraine with military aid and plans to spend a lot more money on defense. Leaders from around the world met at a big security conference in Munich to talk about how Europe can work with other countries to stay safe. They discussed if old friends like the US are enough or if they need new partners. This shows that Europe is quickly adjusting to protect itself in a world that is changing fast.",

    "Europe is a group of countries that have worked together for peace. After World War II, they formed alliances like NATO with the United States to stay safe. Recently, countries like Russia and China have become more aggressive, making Europeans feel less secure. The United States, under leaders like Donald Trump, has sometimes been unpredictable, so Europe is thinking about how to protect itself better. This includes spending more on defense and talking with other countries at meetings like the Munich Security Conference."
