  "title": "Spain's Green Energy Adventure",
  "summary": "In Spain, a town called Figueruelas has a big wind turbine and is getting a new factory to make batteries for electric cars. This shows Spain is using more renewable energy like wind and sun to make electricity. The government wants renewable energy to provide most of the electricity by 2030. But recently, there was a big blackout that left many places without power. Some people think relying too much on renewable energy might have caused the blackout, while others say it was not related. This has started a debate about Spain's energy plans.",

    "Spain is a country in Europe that is trying to use more clean energy from wind and sun. Renewable energy helps reduce pollution and is better for the environment. Sometimes, when countries change how they make electricity, there can be problems like blackouts, which are times when the power goes out. People often debate about the best way to make energy to keep lights on and homes warm."
