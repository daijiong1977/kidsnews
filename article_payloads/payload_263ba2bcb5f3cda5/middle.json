  "title": "Alcaraz and Ferrero: A Surprising Split in Tennis",
  "summary": "Carlos Alcaraz, the world number one tennis player, announced a surprising split with his long-time coach Juan Carlos Ferrero in December. Ferrero had coached Alcaraz since he was 15, guiding him to six major titles, including the French Open and US Open. Alcaraz described the decision as a 'chapter of life that has to end,' emphasizing that it was mutual and they remain friends. He expressed gratitude for the seven years of learning that helped shape his career. The split caught many off guard, including British player Jodie Burrage, who noted the coaching relationship seemed highly successful. Alcaraz is now focused on the Australian Open, aiming to become the youngest man to complete the career Grand Slam. Ferrero revealed he had expected to continue coaching at the Australian Open, adding to the confusion. This event highlights the complexities of athlete-coach dynamics in professional sports.",
