  "title": "Uncovering Stationary Atoms in Liquid Metals",
  "summary": "Researchers have made a groundbreaking discovery in materials science by observing that not all atoms move within a liquid, even at high temperatures. Using transmission electron microscopy, scientists from the University of Nottingham and the University of Ulm studied molten metal nanoparticles, such as platinum and gold, supported on graphene. They found that some atoms remain stationary, strongly bonded to point defects in the graphene. These motionless atoms significantly influence solidification processes: when few are pinned, crystals can grow and solidify the metal, but when many are fixed, they disrupt crystal formation, leading to a corralled supercooled liquid state. This research sheds light on the complex behavior of liquids, which has been less understood compared to gases and solids. The findings have implications for various technologies, including aviation, construction, and electronics, as solidification determines material properties. Additionally, the study utilized the SALVE instrument to explore wave-particle duality of electrons, revealing how electrons can both image materials as waves and fix atoms as particles. This work builds on previous achievements in filming chemical reactions at the atomic level, advancing our ability to control and understand material transformations.",
