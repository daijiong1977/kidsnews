  "title": "Atomic Immobility in Molten Metals: Implications for Solidification and Phase Transitions",
  "summary": "In a seminal study published in ACS Nano, researchers from the University of Nottingham and the University of Ulm have elucidated the phenomenon of atomic immobility within molten metals, challenging conventional paradigms of liquid dynamics. Employing transmission electron microscopy, the team investigated platinum, gold, and palladium nanoparticles on graphene substrates, revealing that certain atoms remain stationary due to strong bonding at point defects, even at elevated temperatures. These immobilized atoms exert a profound influence on solidification mechanisms: sparse pinning facilitates crystalline growth and complete solidification, whereas dense pinning inhibits crystallization, culminating in a corralled supercooled liquid—a novel phase of matter. The research leverages the SALVE instrument's capabilities to explore wave-particle duality, demonstrating how electrons function as both imaging waves and momentum-transferring particles that can fix atoms. This work not only advances fundamental knowledge of liquid-state physics, which has historically been less tractable than gas or solid states, but also has significant technological ramifications. Solidification processes are integral to diverse fields, including mineralization, protein fibril folding, and industrial applications in aviation, construction, and electronics. By providing atomic-scale insights, the study enables precise manipulation of material properties, building on the team's prior achievements in real-time imaging of chemical bonds. The findings underscore the interdisciplinary synergy between materials science, quantum mechanics, and engineering, offering pathways for innovative material design and enhanced functional performance.",
