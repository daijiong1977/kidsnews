  "title": "Atoms That Don't Move in Hot Metal",
  "summary": "Scientists have discovered something amazing about liquids like molten metal. When metal gets very hot and turns into a liquid, most atoms move around quickly, but some atoms stay perfectly still. These motionless atoms are stuck to a special material called graphene, which acts like a tiny stove. The scientists used a powerful microscope to watch tiny drops of metal as they cooled and turned solid. They found that the still atoms can change how the metal solidifies. If only a few atoms are stuck, crystals can grow and the metal becomes solid. But if many atoms are stuck, they block the crystals from forming, creating a strange new state of matter called a corralled supercooled liquid. This discovery helps us understand natural processes like ice formation and is important for making better materials in industries like aviation and electronics.",

    "This article is about a scientific discovery in materials science. Scientists from universities in the UK and Germany studied how liquids turn into solids, which is called solidification. They focused on molten metals like platinum and gold, using advanced tools to see atoms. Understanding this process helps in many areas, such as making stronger metals for airplanes or creating new medicines. The research shows that even in hot liquids, some atoms can stay fixed, affecting the final solid material. This is exciting because it reveals new ways to control materials for better technology and natural processes like ice formation."
