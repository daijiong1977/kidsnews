  "title": "The Hidden Link Between Prince Andrew and Jeffrey Epstein",
  "summary": "This article investigates David Stern, a German businessman who served as a key intermediary between Prince Andrew and Jeffrey Epstein. In spring 2019, Stern attended a gala dinner in Shenzhen, China, for Pitch@Palace, a start-up competition associated with Prince Andrew. This event occurred shortly before Prince Andrew stepped back from royal duties due to controversy over his ties to Epstein, a convicted sex offender. Recent releases of documents by the U.S. Department of Justice reveal Stern's extensive role: he facilitated introductions, managed deals, assisted with Sarah Ferguson's debts, and made derogatory remarks about women. Based in London, Stern ran his own business and referred to Epstein as boss, while also holding positions in royal circles, such as director of Pitch@Palace and board member of St George's House charity. Despite his low public profile, Stern's name appears in over 7,000 documents from 2008 to 2018, highlighting his behind-the-scenes influence. The article uses these emails to illustrate how Stern operated discreetly, emphasizing the complex networks that can exist among influential figures.",
