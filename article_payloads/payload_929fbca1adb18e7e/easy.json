  "title": "A Man Who Connected a Prince and a Bad Person",
  "summary": "This story is about a man named David Stern. He helped connect Prince Andrew, who is a member of the British royal family, with Jeffrey Epstein, a man who did bad things and went to jail. In 2019, Stern was at a party in China for a business event called Pitch@Palace. Later, emails showed that Stern worked quietly in the background to make deals and help with money problems for Prince Andrew and his ex-wife, Sarah Ferguson. Stern was a businessman from Germany who lived in London and called Epstein his boss. He was also part of a royal charity. The article tells us that Stern's name appears in many government documents, but he doesn't talk about it. It's a story about how people can be connected in secret ways.",
