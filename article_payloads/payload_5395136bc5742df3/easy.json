  "title": "Heart Disease Risk in Diabetes: Different for Boys and Girls",
  "summary": "People with type 2 diabetes have a higher chance of getting heart problems like heart attacks. But this risk is not the same for everyone. A new study from Johns Hopkins Medicine looked at why men and women with diabetes might have different heart disease risks. The researchers think that sex hormones, like testosterone and estradiol, could be part of the reason. They studied data from a long-term project called Look Ahead, which tracked people with diabetes over time. They found that in men, higher testosterone was linked to lower heart disease risk, while increases in estradiol were linked to higher risk. For women, the connection between hormones and heart disease was not clear, suggesting other factors might be more important. This research helps doctors understand how to better prevent heart disease in people with diabetes by considering hormone levels along with things like smoking and cholesterol.",

    "Type 2 diabetes is a common disease where the body cannot use sugar properly, leading to high blood sugar. It can cause health problems like heart disease, which includes heart attacks and strokes. Hormones are natural chemicals in our bodies that control many functions, such as growth and energy. Testosterone is often called the 'male hormone,' and estradiol is often called the 'female hormone,' but both are found in everyone. Doctors study these to understand how they affect health risks in different people."
