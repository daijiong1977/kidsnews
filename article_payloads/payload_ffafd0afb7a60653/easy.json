  "title": "Wisconsin Map Changes Might Take a Long Time",
  "summary": "In Wisconsin, there are two court cases about changing the maps that decide who gets elected to Congress. These maps currently help Republicans win more seats. Some people want new maps ready for the 2026 elections, but others say it's too fast. Lawyers for Democrats asked judges to make a decision by March 1, 2026, so new maps can be used. However, judges and lawyers for Republicans think the cases should wait until after 2026, with a trial maybe in 2027. The judges will decide next year if they should dismiss the cases or rule without more arguments. This is the first time special three-judge panels are handling such cases in Wisconsin. The hearings happened in the same courthouse near the state Capitol.",

    "In the United States, states draw maps called districts for elections to Congress. These maps can affect which political party wins more seats. Sometimes, people go to court if they think the maps are unfair. Judges decide if maps need to be changed. This process is called redistricting. In Wisconsin, there is a debate about changing maps before the 2026 elections."
