  "title": "Take That's New Documentary Story",
  "summary": "Take That is a famous band from the UK. They made a documentary in 2005 when they were not active. The documentary was very popular, with over six million people watching it. This helped them get back together and perform in big arenas. Now, twenty years later, they are still successful with hit songs and awards. They have a new documentary on Netflix, but it is different from the old one. The old documentary showed more personal moments, while the new one focuses on their work and friendships. The band members have changed, with Robbie Williams and Jason Orange not in the new film. The article asks what we can learn from this new story since we already know a lot about Take That.",

    "Take That is a British pop band that started in 1990. They became very famous with songs like 'Pray' and 'Back for Good'. In 2005, they made a documentary that showed their lives and helped them reunite. Now, they have a new documentary on Netflix, but it is different because some members are missing and it tells a more polished story. This article compares the two documentaries and asks if we can learn anything new from the band's journey."
