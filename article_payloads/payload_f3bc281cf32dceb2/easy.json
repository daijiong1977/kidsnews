  "title": "Robbie Williams Talks About Feeling Proud and British Habits",
  "summary": "Robbie Williams is a famous singer from Britain who has been making music for over 30 years. He just released a new album called Britpop, which became his 16th number one hit, breaking a record that was held by the Beatles. He is starting a tour to celebrate this success. Robbie says that British people often don't feel good about their achievements and like to make fun of themselves, but he wants to enjoy this moment. He will play in smaller places like he did when he first became famous. The album includes songs with old friends from his band and other musicians. Robbie also talks about feeling sad in the past, even when good things happened, but now he looks back and thinks the 1990s were a special time. Having his daughter helped him feel better and more responsible.",
