  "title": "F1 Racing Gets More Famous Friends",
  "summary": "Formula 1 racing is a fast car sport that has always been glamorous, but now it is becoming even more popular with celebrities. Susie Wolff, who knows a lot about F1, says the paddock area at races is like a catwalk where famous people show up. This change started when a company called Liberty Media bought F1 in 2017 and made it more modern. They stopped using grid girls and made a Netflix show called Drive to Survive, which shows behind-the-scenes drama and has brought in many new young fans. Celebrities like Beyoncé and Jennifer Lopez now go to races, making F1 a hot ticket. The sport is not just about racing anymore; it is also about the fun and excitement off the track.",
