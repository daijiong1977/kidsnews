  "title": "F1's Celebrity Boom: How the Sport is Changing",
  "summary": "Formula 1 is experiencing a new era of celebrity influence, driven by strategic changes and media exposure. Susie Wolff, a former racer and F1 insider, notes that the paddock has transformed into a glamorous catwalk, attracting high-profile figures. This shift began in 2017 when Liberty Media acquired F1, replacing Bernie Ecclestone's long tenure with a focus on modernization through digital rights and social media. Key initiatives included phasing out grid girls and launching the Netflix series Drive to Survive, which offers unfiltered access to drivers and teams, boosting drama and personal stories. As a result, F1's fanbase has grown younger, with 43% under 35, and celebrities like Beyoncé, Jennifer Lopez, and Timothée Chalamet now frequent races, drawn by marketing opportunities and the sport's global appeal. While celebrities have always been part of F1 history, the current trend emphasizes a younger, more diverse audience, making race weekends premier social events. This evolution highlights how F1 balances racing with entertainment to expand its reach.",

    "Formula 1 is a premier motorsport with a 76-year history, known for high-speed racing and luxury associations. Traditionally, it attracted older fans and featured elements like grid girls. In 2017, Liberty Media's acquisition marked a turning point, aiming to rejuvenate the sport by leveraging digital media and social platforms. The Netflix series Drive to Survive, launched in 2019, played a crucial role by humanizing drivers and showcasing off-track drama, resonating with younger audiences. This shift reflects broader trends in sports entertainment, where personality and accessibility drive fan engagement. Celebrities have always been part of F1, but recent years see a surge in A-list attendance, influenced by the sport's enhanced glamour and global marketing. Understanding this context helps explain how F1 adapts to maintain relevance in a competitive media landscape."
