  "title": "A New Vitamin Helps People Feel Better After COVID",
  "summary": "Many people still feel sick after having COVID-19, with problems like tiredness and trouble thinking, called long COVID. Scientists tested a vitamin called nicotinamide riboside (NR) to see if it could help. NR helps cells make energy. In a study, some people took NR pills for up to 20 weeks, while others took fake pills. The scientists checked how people felt and did on memory tests. They found that people who took NR for at least 10 weeks said they felt less tired, slept better, and had better moods. But the memory test scores did not change much. This shows that NR might help with some long COVID symptoms, but more research is needed to be sure.",
