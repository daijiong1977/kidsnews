  "title": "Space Rockets: Successes and Surprises",
  "summary": "This article talks about exciting news in space rockets. Blue Origin's New Glenn rocket had a successful launch and landing, and they plan to make it even stronger. SpaceX is getting ready to test its new Starship rocket. A company called Katalyst won a contract from NASA to rescue an old space telescope named Swift using a Pegasus rocket, which hasn't flown much lately. Another company, Ursa Major, got a lot of money to build rocket engines for defense and space projects. Rocket Lab launched a secret payload quickly from New Zealand. The article explains why the Pegasus rocket was chosen for the rescue mission, even though it's expensive, because it can reach the right orbit and other rockets can't do the job as well. It's all about how companies are working hard to explore space and keep satellites safe.",

    "Space exploration involves sending rockets and satellites into space to learn about the universe. Companies like SpaceX and Blue Origin build rockets to carry payloads, which can be satellites or scientific instruments. Orbits are paths around Earth where satellites stay to do their jobs, like observing stars or helping with weather. Sometimes, old satellites need help to stay in orbit, so rescue missions are planned. Rockets can be launched from the ground or from airplanes, and companies compete to make better and cheaper rockets. Understanding these basics helps us see how space technology is advancing and why certain rockets are used for specific tasks."
