  "title": "Rocket News: SpaceX Booster Fails and Pegasus Rocket Returns",
  "summary": "This article talks about exciting space news. The government shutdown is over, so rocket launches can happen during the day again. Blue Origin's New Glenn rocket had a successful launch and landing, and they plan to make it even stronger with more engines. SpaceX is getting ready to test its new Starship rocket. A company called Katalyst won a contract to rescue an old NASA satellite using Northrop's Pegasus rocket, which hasn't flown in years. Ursa Major, another company, raised a lot of money to build rocket engines. Rocket Lab launched a secret payload quickly. The article explains why Pegasus was chosen for the rescue mission and shares updates on space companies.",

    "Space rockets are vehicles that carry satellites or people into space. Companies like SpaceX and Blue Origin build rockets to explore space or help with science. NASA is a space agency that studies stars and planets. Sometimes, old satellites need help to stay in orbit, so rescue missions are planned. Rockets can use different fuels and be launched from the ground or from airplanes."
