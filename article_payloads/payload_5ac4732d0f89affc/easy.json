  "title": "Actor Colin Salmon Thanks Court for Kindness After Speeding",
  "summary": "Colin Salmon is an actor from the TV show EastEnders and James Bond movies. He was caught driving too fast in London, going 24mph in a 20mph zone. This gave him more points on his driving licence. Usually, this means a six-month ban from driving, but the court did not ban him. The court showed compassion because Colin takes care of his sick wife and daughter, driving them to doctor appointments. He said sorry and thanked the court for understanding his family situation. He was fined money instead of getting a ban. Colin is happy he can still drive to help his family.",
