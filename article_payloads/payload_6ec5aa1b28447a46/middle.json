  "title": "Alcaraz Overcomes Cramps in Epic Australian Open Semifinal Victory",
  "summary": "In a dramatic Australian Open semifinal, Carlos Alcaraz of Spain defeated Alexander Zverev in a grueling five-hour, 27-minute match to advance to his first final at this tournament. Alcaraz started strong, winning the first two sets, but faced a major setback in the third set when he experienced severe cramping, impairing his movement and serve. Despite this, he took a medical timeout and, with support from the crowd, mounted an incredible comeback in the fifth set. Zverev had an early break and served for the match at 5-4, but Alcaraz broke back and capitalized on Zverev's nerves to secure a 7-5 victory. Post-match, Alcaraz emphasized self-belief and credited the fans for their encouragement. This win keeps his pursuit of a career Grand Slam alive; if he triumphs on Sunday, he will become the youngest man to achieve this feat. The final will likely feature a showdown with Novak Djokovic or Jannik Sinner, adding to the historical significance. Alcaraz's resilience, reminiscent of past comebacks like at the French Open, highlights his mental toughness in high-pressure situations.",
