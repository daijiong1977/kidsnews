  "summary": "Carlos Alcaraz, a young tennis player from Spain, won a very long and exciting match against Alexander Zverev to reach the Australian Open final. The match lasted over five hours, and Alcaraz had to fight hard because he started cramping, which made it hard for him to move and serve. Even though he was hurting, he didn't give up. With help from the cheering crowd, he came back when Zverev was close to winning. Alcaraz broke Zverev's serve and won the match in the fifth set. After the win, Alcaraz said he always believes in himself and thanked the fans. This victory means he has a chance to win another big tournament and make tennis history by becoming the youngest man to win all four Grand Slam titles. Now, he will play in the final on Sunday.",
