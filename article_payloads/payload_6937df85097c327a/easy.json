  "title": "Are Two Tennis Stars Making Big Tournaments Too Predictable?",
  "summary": "In tennis, two young players named Carlos Alcaraz and Jannik Sinner have been winning most of the big tournaments called Grand Slams. They have played against each other in the last three finals, and their matches are very exciting, like when Alcaraz saved three championship points to win at Roland Garros. But some people worry that if only these two players keep winning, the men's tennis tournaments might become too predictable and boring. Pat Cash, a former Wimbledon champion, says it's not healthy to have just two players dominating because it means other players don't get as much attention. In the Australian Open, Alcaraz and Sinner are playing well, but Sinner had a lucky break due to heat that helped him win a match. The article asks if having only two top players is good for tennis.",
