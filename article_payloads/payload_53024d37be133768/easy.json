  "title": "Ancient Mystery: A Big Group Burial Found in Scotland",
  "summary": "Archaeologists found a very old burial site in Scotland that is about 3,300 years old. They dug it up while building a wind farm near a place called Sanquhar. They discovered a burial mound with five urns that held the burned bones of at least eight people. These urns were all buried together at the same time, which is unusual. The archaeologist, Thomas Muir, thinks something bad like a famine might have happened, causing many people to die quickly. This is different from other burials where bodies were left out for a while. The site helps us learn about life in the Bronze Age and what might have caused this sad event.",

    "In ancient times, people in Scotland lived during the Bronze Age, which was about 4,000 to 2,500 years ago. They often buried their dead in special ways, like in mounds or urns. Sometimes, bad things like famines could happen, making many people die at once. Archaeologists study these old sites to understand how people lived and what challenges they faced."
