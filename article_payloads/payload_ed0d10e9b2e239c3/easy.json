  "title": "Countries Building Their Own Rockets for Space",
  "summary": "Some countries are working hard to build their own rockets to launch satellites into space. This is important for their safety and independence. Countries like Australia, Canada, Germany, and Spain are spending money to create their own rocket companies. They want to stop relying on other countries, especially the United States and its company SpaceX. Germany is giving a lot of money to three new rocket companies. Italy is also helping a company that makes rockets. These countries believe having their own rockets makes them stronger and safer. They want to control how their satellites get to space without depending on others.",

    "Space is important for many things like GPS, weather forecasts, and communication. Countries use satellites in space to help with these tasks. Launching satellites requires rockets. Some big countries like the United States and China have their own rockets, but smaller countries often pay others to launch their satellites. Now, more countries want to build their own rockets to be independent and safe. This means they can control their own space missions without asking for help."
