  "title": "A News Story About a Chancellor and a Budget",
  "summary": "This article talks about Rachel Reeves, who is the Chancellor in the UK government. She held a special news conference before her Budget to tell people about her plans. She said taxes would go up and she wanted to help with living costs, which she did in the Budget. But there was a problem: she knew that tax money coming in was better than expected, which made things easier for her, but she didn't tell everyone at the news conference. The article says this was misleading because she kept that important information secret. It explains how the Office for Budget Responsibility, a group that checks the numbers, later showed what she knew. The writer, Chris Mason from BBC News, thinks this was not honest because people should know all the facts to understand the Budget decisions.",

    "This article is about a news story from BBC News. In the UK, the Chancellor is a government minister who makes decisions about money, like taxes and spending. A Budget is a big plan announced each year to show how the government will use money. Sometimes, leaders share information to help people understand, but if they hide facts, it can be misleading. The Office for Budget Responsibility is an independent group that checks the government's numbers to make sure they are fair and accurate. This story helps us learn about honesty in sharing information."
