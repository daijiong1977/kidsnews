  "title": "Why the Maya Cities Disappeared",
  "summary": "Long ago, the Maya people built big cities in places like Mexico and Central America. They were farmers who grew food and lived together. But life in cities was hard because of sickness, fighting, and not enough resources. Scientists studied why people left these cities. They found that when it became too costly to live in cities, people moved back to the countryside. This happened because of droughts, conflicts, and better conditions in rural areas. The Maya collapse wasn't just about lack of rain; it was about many problems adding up. This helps us understand how cities grow and shrink over time.",

    "The Maya were an ancient civilization in places like Mexico and Guatemala. They built cities with temples and farms. People lived there for hundreds of years, but around 900 AD, many cities were abandoned. Scientists think problems like droughts, wars, and hard city life made people leave. This helps us learn about how cities can change and why people might move away from them today."
