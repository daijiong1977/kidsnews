  "title": "Charli XCX's New Music Adventure",
  "summary": "A songwriter named Finn Keane worked with pop star Charli XCX on her fun dance album called Brat. After that, they decided to try something new by making music for a movie called Wuthering Heights, which is based on an old book. They wanted to do something different from dance music, so they used instruments like an orchestra to create a spooky and exciting sound. They worked on the songs while traveling for concerts, sometimes in hotel rooms. This change was a big step for Charli's music career, and they were very happy to surprise people with something fresh.",
