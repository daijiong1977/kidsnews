  "title": "Charli XCX's Artistic Shift to Wuthering Heights Soundtrack",
  "summary": "Finn Keane, a songwriter and Grammy-winning producer who collaborated with Charli XCX on her electro-dance album Brat, describes creating the soundtrack for Emerald Fennell's film adaptation of Wuthering Heights as an ideal pivot. After the Brat summer phenomenon ended in 2024, Charli sought a new direction, and both she and Keane were inspired by the darker themes of the Emily Brontë classic. They viewed this project as a counterpoint to their previous work, moving away from the dance world to explore orchestral elements recorded at Abbey Road Studios for a gothic feel. The soundtrack was developed during tours for the Brat remix album, with sessions in studios or hotel rooms, showcasing Charli's preference for working in extremes. This shift highlights her artistic growth and desire to surprise audiences, contrasting with her earlier work on the Barbie soundtrack.",
