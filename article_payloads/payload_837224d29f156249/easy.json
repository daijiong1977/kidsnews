  "title": "Astronaut's Health Problem Ends Space Mission Early",
  "summary": "Nasa is bringing four astronauts back from the International Space Station earlier than planned because one of them has a serious health issue. The astronaut is safe and stable, but Nasa wants to make sure they get the best care. This is not an emergency, but it is the first time a mission has ended early for health reasons. The astronauts are part of Crew-11 and have been in space since last August. They were supposed to stay for six months, but now they will come back a month early. One American astronaut will stay on the space station with two Russian cosmonauts. The space station has doctors on Earth who can talk to the astronauts and help them. Returning early might delay some science experiments and repairs until new astronauts arrive next month.",

    "The International Space Station is a home in space where astronauts from different countries live and work together. They do science experiments to learn about space and help people on Earth. Astronauts train for years to go to space, and their health is very important. Nasa always puts safety first, so if an astronaut gets sick, they might come back early to get better care on Earth. This shows how space missions need careful planning to keep everyone safe."
