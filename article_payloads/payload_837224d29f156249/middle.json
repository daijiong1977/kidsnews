  "title": "Medical Issue Forces Early Return from International Space Station",
  "summary": "Nasa has decided to shorten the mission of Crew-11 aboard the International Space Station by one month due to a serious medical condition affecting one astronaut. The agency has not revealed the astronaut's identity or specific condition, citing privacy, but confirmed the individual is stable and this is not an emergency evacuation. This marks the first early return in the ISS's history, which has been continuously occupied since 2000. Crew-11 consists of four members: Nasa astronauts Zena Cardman and Mike Fincke, JAXA astronaut Kimiya Yui, and Russian cosmonaut Oleg Platonov. They launched in August last year for a six-month stay and were scheduled to return next month after being replaced by another crew. One American astronaut will remain on the ISS with two Russian cosmonauts. The ISS is equipped with basic medical tools and communication systems, allowing Earth-based doctors to consult privately with astronauts. Early return may delay some experiments and maintenance tasks until the new crew arrives. Nasa officials emphasized that the medical issue is unrelated to space operations or injuries, highlighting their commitment to astronaut well-being.",

    "The International Space Station is a symbol of global cooperation, involving space agencies from the US, Russia, Japan, Europe, and Canada. Astronauts conduct experiments in microgravity to advance science in fields like biology, physics, and medicine. Missions typically last six months, with crews rotating to maintain continuous human presence. Health monitoring is critical in space due to risks like radiation and isolation. Nasa has protocols for medical emergencies, including telemedicine consultations. This incident underscores the challenges of long-duration spaceflight and the importance of adaptive planning to ensure crew safety and mission success."
