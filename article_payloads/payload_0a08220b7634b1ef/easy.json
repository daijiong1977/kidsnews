  "title": "UK's Plan to Stop Harmful Forever Chemicals",
  "summary": "The UK has started a new plan to deal with 'forever chemicals,' which are called PFAS. These chemicals are used in many things we use every day, like school uniforms and frying pans, because they can resist water and oil. But they don't go away easily and can build up in the environment, which might be bad for our health and nature. The government wants to test more water and soil to find where these chemicals are. They also plan to make rules to limit their use by 2029, similar to what the EU is doing. Some people want faster action, but it takes time to change rules. The plan aims to protect people and the environment by finding safer alternatives.",

    "Forever chemicals, or PFAS, are man-made substances found in many everyday items like clothes and cookware because they help repel water and stains. They are called 'forever' because they don't break down easily and can linger in nature for years, potentially harming animals and people. Governments around the world are creating plans to reduce their use and find better options to keep everyone safe."
