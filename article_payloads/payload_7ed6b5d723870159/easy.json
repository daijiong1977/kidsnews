  "title": "Church Leaders Asked to Stop Money Plan for Slavery History",
  "summary": "A new leader of the Church of England, Dame Sarah Mullally, is being asked by some politicians to cancel a plan to spend £100 million. This money is meant to help fix problems from the Church's past links to slavery. A long time ago, the Church had a fund that was used to support slavery, which hurt many people. Now, the Church wants to use the £100 million to help communities affected by slavery through projects like research and support. But the politicians say the money should only be used for churches and paying priests, as the law requires. They think churches need the money more because many are struggling to stay open. The Church says their plan follows the law and aims to make things right for past wrongs.",

    "The Church of England is a large religious group in England with a long history. Slavery was a practice where people were forced to work without freedom, especially affecting African people during the transatlantic slave trade. Money like £100 million is a huge amount that can help many people, but it must be used carefully according to rules called laws. Politicians, such as MPs, are elected to make decisions about how money and resources are used in the country. Communities are groups of people who live together and share common needs, and helping them can make society better."
