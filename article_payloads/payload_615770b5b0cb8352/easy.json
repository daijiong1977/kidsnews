  "title": "Prime Minister Keir Starmer's New Year Plans",
  "summary": "Prime Minister Keir Starmer is starting the new year feeling refreshed after a tough time in 2025. He talks to a reporter and says he will stay in his job until 2027, no matter what happens. He had a busy day, speaking to leaders from Ukraine and dealing with news from Venezuela. Starmer believes he will be judged by the people in the next big election, but some of his friends in the Labour Party think he is not doing a good job and want him to leave. He says he will not quit, even if the party does badly in upcoming elections in May. Starmer hopes things will get better this year, like the economy improving, and he wants to lead the fight against other political groups.",
