  "title": "Building Homes and Helping Wildlife in England",
  "summary": "In England, the government has changed some rules to help build more houses. Builders used to have to make new homes better for animals and plants, but now smaller building projects don't have to do this. This change is part of a plan to build 1.5 million new homes. Some people who care about nature are worried because they think it might hurt wildlife. They say it could slow down efforts to protect animals and plants. But other people, like builders, think the old rules made building too hard and expensive. The government says the new rules will make it easier to build homes on small pieces of land, helping about 12,500 homes each year. They also want to say yes to building near train stations and include things like special bricks for birds in new houses.",

    "In England, there is a big need for more houses because many people need places to live. At the same time, it's important to protect animals and plants in nature. The government makes rules called Biodiversity Net Gain that ask builders to help wildlife when they build new homes. Recently, the government changed these rules so that smaller building projects don't have to follow them as much. This is to make it easier and faster to build houses, but some people who love nature are upset because they worry it will harm wildlife. Builders, on the other hand, are happy because they think the old rules were too tough. The government says this change is part of a plan to build many new homes and help solve the housing problem."
