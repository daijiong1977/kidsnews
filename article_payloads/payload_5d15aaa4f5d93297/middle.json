Survivors were advised to shelter in place until rescue teams could reach them. The Sierra Avalanche Center warned of high avalanche danger due to rapid snowfall and gale-force winds on fragile snowpack, emphasizing the risks in backcountry areas during storms. This event highlights the challenges of mountain rescues and the importance of avalanche awareness.",

    "Backcountry skiing involves skiing in remote, unpatrolled mountain areas, which carries higher risks like avalanches. Avalanches occur when snow layers become unstable and slide, often triggered by weather conditions such as heavy snowfall or wind. Rescue operations in such environments require coordination among agencies like sheriff's offices and fire departments. The Sierra Avalanche Center monitors snow conditions to provide warnings. Understanding avalanche safety, including checking forecasts and carrying emergency gear, is crucial for outdoor enthusiasts in snowy regions."
