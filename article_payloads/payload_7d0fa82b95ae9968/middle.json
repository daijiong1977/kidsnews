  "title": "James Webb Telescope Captures Distant Supernova from Cosmic Dawn",
  "summary": "Astronomers have achieved a significant breakthrough by using the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) to detect a supernova at an unprecedented distance, occurring when the universe was approximately 730 million years old during the reionisation era. The discovery began with a long-duration gamma-ray burst (GRB) detected by the SVOM monitor, which led to follow-up observations with the ESO/VLT and JWST. JWST's Near Infrared Camera enabled researchers to isolate the supernova's fading light from its host galaxy, confirming its nature. This supernova, named SN in GRB 250314A, closely resembles SN 1998bw, a known supernova from a gamma-ray burst, suggesting that massive stars in the early universe died similarly to those today. The findings challenge previous assumptions that early star explosions would be brighter or different, indicating consistency across cosmic time. Future JWST observations are planned to further study the host galaxy and refine understanding of stellar evolution in the early universe.",

    "Supernovae are catastrophic explosions marking the end of massive stars, crucial for enriching the universe with elements. The James Webb Space Telescope, launched in 2021, excels in infrared astronomy to peer into the early universe. Gamma-ray bursts are intense emissions from cosmic events, often linked to supernovae or black holes. The reionisation era, around 400 million to 1 billion years after the Big Bang, saw the formation of the first luminous objects. Studying distant supernovae helps astronomers understand stellar evolution and cosmic history."
