  "title": "A Star Explodes Far, Far Away: James Webb Telescope Sees It!",
  "summary": "Astronomers used the James Webb Space Telescope to see a supernova, which is when a big star explodes. This happened a very long time ago, when the universe was young, about 730 million years old. It was found because of a bright flash called a gamma-ray burst. The telescope took pictures to separate the supernova's light from its galaxy. This helps scientists learn about how stars died in the early universe. The supernova looks similar to ones we see closer to Earth, which is surprising. Scientists will keep watching it to learn more about the galaxy where it happened.",

    "A supernova is a huge explosion that happens when a massive star dies. The James Webb Space Telescope is a new telescope that can see very far into space. Gamma-ray bursts are flashes of energy that come from space events like star explosions. The early universe was when everything was just starting, and scientists study it to learn how stars and galaxies formed."
