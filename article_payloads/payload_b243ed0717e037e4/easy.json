  "title": "A Saturn-Sized Planet Found in Space",
  "summary": "Scientists have found a new planet in space that is as big as Saturn. They used a special method called microlensing to see it. Microlensing happens when a planet moves between Earth and a star, making the star look brighter for a short time. This planet is special because it is not orbiting any star; it is floating alone in space. It is called a rogue planet. The planet was found in a place called the \"Einstein desert,\" which is a gap where not many planets are seen. This discovery helps scientists learn how rogue planets are made. They think rogue planets can form in two ways: either they are kicked out of their star system by gravity, or they form like stars but stop growing. The planet was spotted by telescopes on Earth and a space telescope called Gaia. Finding this planet tells us more about the universe and the different kinds of planets out there.",

    "Scientists study planets in space to understand how they form. Most planets orbit stars, but some, called rogue planets, float alone. They use tools like telescopes and microlensing to find these planets. Microlensing works when a planet passes in front of a star, making it look brighter. This helps find planets that are hard to see. The Einstein desert is a term for a gap in space where not many planets are found. Learning about rogue planets helps us know more about the universe."
