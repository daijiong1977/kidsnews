  "title": "Jobs and Layoffs: What's Happening in the U.S. Economy?",
  "summary": "In January 2026, the U.S. economy added 130,000 new jobs, which is good news because it means more people are working. The unemployment rate went down a little to 4.3%. But there is also some bad news. The government revised last year's job numbers and found that only 181,000 jobs were added in 2025, which is much fewer than they thought before. At the same time, big companies like Amazon and UPS are laying off thousands of workers. This mix of good and bad news makes people unsure about how strong the economy really is. An expert named Harry Holzer, who used to work for the government, helps explain what these numbers mean for jobs and the future.",

    "The U.S. economy is like a big machine that creates jobs for people to work and earn money. Sometimes, the government counts how many jobs are added each month and year to see if the economy is doing well. When companies lay off workers, it means they are letting people go, which can make it harder for those people to find new jobs. Experts help us understand these numbers to know if the economy is strong or weak."
