  "title": "Kate Winslet on Media Intrusion and Personal Resilience",
  "summary": "Kate Winslet, acclaimed for her role in Titanic, discusses the intense media scrutiny she faced after achieving fame. She describes paparazzi following her, phone tapping, and invasions like rummaging through her bins to speculate on her diet. This intrusion was exacerbated during a marriage breakdown, leading her to cope with simple comforts: a good meal, shared conversations, coffee, music, and personal routines. Winslet reflects on early body image struggles, including childhood teasing and pressure from a drama teacher, which led to unhealthy dieting habits. Post-Titanic, she encountered abusive media coverage and unauthorized photo edits in magazines, causing fear and isolation. However, she emphasizes resilience through support from friends and neighbors, who offered gestures like leaving pasta and wine. This summary highlights her journey of dealing with public scrutiny and advocating for mental well-being.",
