  "title": "Soldiers Ready to Help in Minnesota",
  "summary": "The U.S. Army has told 1,500 soldiers to be ready to go to Minnesota if needed. These soldiers are from Alaska and are trained for cold weather. They might be sent if the President decides to use a special law called the Insurrection Act. This law lets the President use soldiers to help with law enforcement. The President talked about using this law because of protests in Minnesota about immigration rules. He said he might use it if local leaders don't stop people from causing trouble. Later, he said he doesn't need to use it right now, but he could if necessary. The soldiers are just waiting and haven't gone yet.",

    "Minnesota is a state in the U.S. known for its cold winters. The U.S. Army has soldiers all over the world to protect the country. Sometimes, the President can use a law to send soldiers to help with problems inside the U.S., like protests. Protests happen when people want to show they are unhappy about rules, such as immigration rules. Immigration is about people moving to a new country to live. The President is the top leader who makes big decisions for the country."
