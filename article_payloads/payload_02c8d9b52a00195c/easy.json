  "title": "Americans Feel Less Hopeful About the Future",
  "summary": "A new poll shows that many Americans are feeling less hopeful about their future. The poll, called a Gallup poll, asks people to rate how good they think their life will be in five years. In 2025, only 59% of Americans said they feel very good about their future, which is the lowest number in almost 20 years. This means people are more gloomy or sad about what might happen. The poll also found that fewer than half of Americans, about 48%, are in a group called 'thriving,' which means they feel good about both their current life and future. People's feelings can change when a new president is elected, but this time, even with a president back in office, not everyone feels better. This poll helps us understand how Americans are feeling and why it's important to talk about hope.",
