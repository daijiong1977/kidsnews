  "title": "Helping Boys Learn Respect in Schools",
  "summary": "The government in England has a new plan to help boys in schools learn to respect girls and women. They want to stop bad ideas about girls from spreading early. Teachers will get special training to spot and fix problems in the classroom. Some boys who show risky behavior might go to extra classes to learn better ways to act. Students will also learn about important topics like saying yes or no to things, not sharing private pictures, and finding good role models. There will be a new helpline for teenagers to call if they are worried about abuse in their relationships. The government hopes this will make schools safer and prevent violence against women and girls in the future. Some people think the plan is good but needs more money to really work.",

    "In England, schools are working to make sure all students feel safe and respected. Sometimes, boys might learn bad ideas about girls from friends or the internet, which can lead to bullying or worse problems. The government wants to stop this early by teaching good behavior. Teachers are important because they can help students understand right from wrong. Learning about respect and healthy relationships helps everyone get along better and prevents harm. This plan is part of a bigger effort to reduce violence against women and girls, which is a serious issue in many places."
