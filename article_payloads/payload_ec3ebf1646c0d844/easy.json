  "title": "A Special Heart from King Henry VIII's Time",
  "summary": "The British Museum in London has raised enough money to keep a special gold pendant called the Tudor Heart. This pendant is linked to King Henry VIII and his first wife, Katherine of Aragon. It was found by a person using a metal detector in a field in Warwickshire in 2019. The museum needed £3.5 million to buy it and put it on display forever. Many people helped by donating money, including over 45,000 members of the public. The pendant has symbols like a Tudor rose and a pomegranate, and it might have been made for a royal wedding celebration long ago. Now, everyone can see it at the museum and learn about history.",
