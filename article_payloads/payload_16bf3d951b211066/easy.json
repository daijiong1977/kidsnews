  "title": "TV Licence Fee Going Up in the UK",
  "summary": "The TV licence fee in the UK will increase by £5.50 to £180 starting in April. This fee helps pay for BBC shows and services like TV and online programs. The government announced this change, and the fee goes up every year with inflation until 2027. People need a TV licence if they watch or download BBC shows on iPlayer or watch live TV on any channel. The government is also asking the public for ideas on how to fund the BBC in the future, which might include different payment options. They want to make sure the funding is fair and affordable for everyone, especially during tough times with living costs. Some people, like those over 75 on pension credit, can get a free licence, and others may pay less.",

    "In the UK, people need a TV licence to watch or record TV shows as they are broadcast or to use BBC iPlayer. This fee helps fund the BBC, which provides TV, radio, and online services without ads. The government sets the fee and reviews it regularly to make sure it is fair. Recently, there have been discussions about changing how the BBC is funded because of rising costs and new ways people watch TV. Some ideas include different payment models, like subscriptions or ads, to make it more modern and affordable for households."
