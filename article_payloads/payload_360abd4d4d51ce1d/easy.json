  "title": "What Businesses Can Expect from the Budget",
  "summary": "Businesses are feeling nervous before the government's Budget announcement. Last year, taxes went up a lot, which made things hard for companies. Now, business leaders are worried about what might happen next. The Budget could raise taxes again, which might slow down the economy. But the Bank of England might lower interest rates to help people borrow and spend money. The government wants to avoid big surprises and focus on stability. For example, they might make discounts on business rates permanent to help small shops and restaurants. This article explains who is involved, what might change, where this is happening, and why it matters to businesses.",

    "The Budget is a big plan made by the government each year to decide how to spend money and collect taxes. Businesses pay taxes to the government, which can affect how much money they have. Last year, taxes went up, making it harder for businesses to grow. Now, business leaders are worried that taxes might rise again in the new Budget. The government is trying to balance things by possibly lowering interest rates to encourage spending. This is happening in the UK, and it's important because it affects jobs and the economy."
