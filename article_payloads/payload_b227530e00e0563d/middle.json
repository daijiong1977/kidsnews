  "title": "Early Detection of Alzheimer's Through Brain Signal Analysis",
  "summary": "Researchers at Brown University, in collaboration with scientists from Complutense University of Madrid, have identified a brain-based biomarker that may predict the progression from mild cognitive impairment to Alzheimer's disease. They studied 85 individuals diagnosed with mild cognitive impairment, using magnetoencephalography (MEG) to noninvasively record their brain activity during rest. By applying the Spectral Events Toolbox—a computational method developed at Brown—they analyzed beta frequency band signals, which are associated with memory processes. The study found that participants who developed Alzheimer's within two and a half years exhibited beta events with lower rate, shorter duration, and weaker power compared to those with stable conditions. This discovery offers a new approach to early detection, complementing existing biomarkers like beta amyloid and tau proteins, by directly measuring neuronal responses. It highlights the potential for improved diagnosis and intervention strategies in Alzheimer's research.",

    "Alzheimer's disease is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder that impairs memory and cognitive function, often starting with mild cognitive impairment. Current biomarkers, such as beta amyloid plaques and tau tangles detected in spinal fluid or blood, indicate protein accumulation but do not directly reflect brain cell activity. Magnetoencephalography (MEG) is a neuroimaging technique that measures magnetic fields from neuronal electrical signals, offering high temporal resolution for studying brain dynamics. The Spectral Events Toolbox is an analytical method that decomposes brain signals into events to examine their properties, widely used in neuroscience. Understanding beta frequency bands is crucial as they are involved in memory processes, making them relevant for Alzheimer's research. This study's findings could enhance early diagnosis and inform therapeutic strategies by providing a direct measure of brain function."
