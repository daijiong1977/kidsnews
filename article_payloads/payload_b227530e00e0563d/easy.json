  "title": "Finding Brain Clues for Alzheimer's Disease Early",
  "summary": "Scientists at Brown University have discovered a new way to predict Alzheimer's disease early by looking at brain signals. They studied 85 people with mild memory problems, using a special machine called MEG to record their brain activity while they rested. The researchers found that certain brain signals, called beta events, were different in people who later developed Alzheimer's. These signals were weaker, shorter, and less frequent two and a half years before diagnosis. This discovery is exciting because it helps doctors spot Alzheimer's sooner without invasive tests, using a tool that analyzes brain patterns. It could lead to better treatments and help patients prepare earlier.",

    "Alzheimer's disease is a common brain illness that mostly affects older people, causing them to forget things and have trouble thinking. Scientists are always looking for ways to find it early so they can help patients better. Brain signals are like tiny electrical messages that brain cells send to each other; by studying these, researchers can learn how the brain works and when something is wrong. Mild memory problems mean someone has a little trouble remembering but isn't very sick yet. Tools like MEG are safe and don't hurt people, making them good for studying brains over time."
