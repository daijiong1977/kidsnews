  "title": "How Scientists Check if Quantum Computers Are Right",
  "summary": "Quantum computers are super-fast machines that can solve hard problems regular computers can't. Scientists are working to make them reliable for things like medicine and security. A big challenge is checking if their answers are correct, especially for problems that would take supercomputers billions of years to solve. Researchers at Swinburne University found a new way to test a type of quantum computer called a Gaussian Boson Sampler. This machine uses light particles called photons to do calculations. The new method can quickly find errors in the results using just a laptop. This helps make sure quantum computers work properly and can be trusted for important tasks in the future.",

    "Quantum computers are advanced machines that use the rules of quantum physics to process information much faster than regular computers. They can help solve complex problems in science, medicine, and technology. However, because they work differently, it's tricky to know if their answers are correct, especially for tasks that would take supercomputers an extremely long time. This article talks about new tools scientists made to check these answers quickly and find mistakes, which is important for building trustworthy quantum computers in the future."
