  "title": "Nemo Returns Eurovision Trophy to Protest Israel",
  "summary": "Nemo, who won the Eurovision Song Contest last year, is giving back their trophy. They are doing this to protest Israel being in the contest. Nemo says Israel's participation does not match the contest's values of unity and inclusion. Israel is involved in a war in Gaza, which has caused tension. Some other countries are also boycotting next year's event because of Israel. Nemo is a non-binary singer from Switzerland and the first non-binary winner. They felt alone during the contest and hope for better support for artists. Nemo posted a video of packing the trophy to send it back to the contest organizers, who said they are sad but respect Nemo's decision.",

    "Eurovision is an annual song contest where European countries compete. It promotes unity and music. Nemo won in 2024 with a song about being non-binary. Israel has been in the contest for years, but its involvement in the Gaza war has led to protests. Some people think countries at war should not be in events that celebrate peace. Nemo's action is part of a bigger debate about politics in entertainment."
