  "title": "The Search for Nancy Guthrie: A Kidnapping Mystery",
  "summary": "Nancy Guthrie, an 84-year-old woman from Arizona, went missing from her home. Her family last saw her on January 31 after dinner and games. The next day, she didn't go to church, so they reported her missing. Authorities think she was kidnapped because they found her blood on the porch and her doorbell camera was turned off. Nancy has a pacemaker and needs medicine, so everyone is worried about her health. Police are looking for clues, like ransom notes, but haven't found a suspect yet. Neighbors are helping by sharing camera videos. The search continues to bring Nancy home safely.",
