  "title": "Solar Power Beats Water Power in the US",
  "summary": "In 2025, the United States used more electricity than before, with a 2.8% increase. Solar power grew a lot, making 35% more energy and passing hydroelectric power for the first time. This is good news because solar is clean energy. However, coal power also increased by 13% because it became cheaper and the government kept some coal plants open. Wind power also grew. The government under President Trump did not like renewable energy much, but solar and wind are still getting bigger because they are cost-effective. More solar and wind projects are planned for 2026, which will help renewable energy provide nearly a quarter of US electricity. Battery storage is also expanding to save extra solar power. Overall, solar and wind are becoming more important than water power in making electricity.",

    "This article talks about how the US makes electricity. In 2025, people used more electricity than before. Solar power grew a lot and became more important than water power. Coal power also increased because it was cheaper. The government did not support renewable energy much, but solar and wind are still growing because they are good for the environment and cost less. More projects are coming to add solar and wind power in 2026. Battery storage is also being added to save energy. This shows that clean energy is becoming a bigger part of how we power our homes and schools."
