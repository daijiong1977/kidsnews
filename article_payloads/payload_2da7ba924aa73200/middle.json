  "title": "US Energy Shift: Solar Overtakes Hydro Amid Rising Demand",
  "summary": "In 2025, US electricity consumption increased by 2.8%, driven by factors like heating, cooling, and economic growth. Solar power experienced remarkable growth, rising 35% and surpassing hydroelectric generation for the first time, contributing to renewable energy expansion. However, coal power also increased by 13% due to economic viability and government policies that kept some coal plants operational. The Trump administration showed hostility towards renewables but could not halt their economic advantages. Wind power grew as well, with new projects planned for 2026, including significant solar and wind capacity additions. Battery storage is expanding rapidly, particularly in California and Texas, to manage excess solar energy. Overall, renewable sources like solar and wind are poised to outpace hydropower and coal, potentially reaching nearly a quarter of the US electricity mix. The article highlights the complex interplay between rising demand, fossil fuels, and the unstoppable growth of clean energy technologies.",

    "This article discusses US energy trends in 2025, based on data from the Energy Information Administration. Electricity demand rose due to factors like heating, cooling, and economic activities. Solar power showed significant growth, overtaking hydroelectric generation, while coal use increased because of lower costs and government interventions. The Trump administration opposed renewables but could not stop their economic rise. Future projections include major additions of solar and wind capacity, with battery storage playing a crucial role in grid management. Understanding these dynamics requires knowledge of energy sources, policy impacts, and technological advancements in renewable energy."
