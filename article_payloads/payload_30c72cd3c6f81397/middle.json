  "title": "Mourners Gather in Rome for Valentino's Funeral",
  "summary": "The funeral of Italian fashion designer Valentino Garavani took place in Rome on Friday, attended by notable figures from the fashion and film industries, including Anna Wintour, Elizabeth Hurley, and Anne Hathaway. Held at the Basilica of Saint Mary of the Angels and Martyrs, the service followed two days of public viewing at his foundation's headquarters. Valentino, who died at age 93 in Rome, was renowned for his career that began in the 1950s, dressing celebrities such as Jackie Kennedy, Elizabeth Taylor, and Princess Diana. Outside the basilica, crowds paid respects with red ribbons, symbolizing his signature 'Valentino red.' The coffin was adorned with white roses and lilies, accompanied by Mozart's music, and Valentino will be cremated, with his ashes interred at Rome's Flaminio Cemetery. Despite retiring in 2008, his influence endures, with an upcoming couture show in Paris serving as a tribute to his legacy as a key figure in Italian fashion.",
