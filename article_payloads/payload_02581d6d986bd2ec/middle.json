  "title": "NASA's Crew-11 Mission: An Early Return Due to Medical Evacuation",
  "summary": "NASA's Crew-11 mission successfully ended with a splashdown in the Pacific Ocean off San Diego, marking the conclusion of a five-month stay on the International Space Station. The crew, comprising NASA astronauts Zena Cardman and Mike Fincke, JAXA astronaut Kimiya Yui, and Roscosmos cosmonaut Oleg Platonov, returned about one month earlier than planned due to a medical concern involving one member, who remains stable. During their time in orbit, they completed over 140 science experiments, contributed to station maintenance, and celebrated 25 years of continuous human presence on the ISS. The mission launched in August 2025 and involved 167 days in space, with the astronauts traveling nearly 71 million miles. After landing, they were transported to a hospital for evaluation before heading to NASA's Johnson Space Center for postflight checks. This event highlights NASA's Commercial Crew Program with SpaceX, demonstrating the ability to handle unexpected challenges and support international collaboration in space exploration as NASA prepares for future missions to the Moon and Mars.",

    "The International Space Station is a collaborative project involving multiple space agencies, including NASA, Roscosmos, JAXA, and others, serving as a microgravity laboratory for scientific research. NASA's Commercial Crew Program, established to reduce reliance on foreign spacecraft, partners with private U.S. companies like SpaceX to transport astronauts to and from the ISS. Medical evacuations in space are rare but critical for crew safety, involving careful planning and rapid response. This mission underscores the importance of international cooperation in advancing human spaceflight and preparing for future exploration beyond Earth orbit, such as the Artemis missions to the Moon."
