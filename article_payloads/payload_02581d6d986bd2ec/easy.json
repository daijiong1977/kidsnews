  "title": "Astronauts Come Home Early from Space",
  "summary": "Four astronauts from NASA, Japan, and Russia came back to Earth early from the International Space Station. They landed safely in the Pacific Ocean near San Diego after spending over five months in space. The crew did many science experiments and helped keep the space station running. They returned about one month earlier than planned because one astronaut had a medical issue, but everyone is okay. After landing, they went to a hospital for check-ups and will go to NASA in Houston. This mission shows how countries work together in space and how NASA can bring astronauts home quickly if needed.",

    "Space is a place far above Earth where astronauts go to live and work on the International Space Station. They do experiments to help us learn about science and prepare for future trips to the Moon and Mars. NASA is the U.S. space agency that sends astronauts into space with help from companies like SpaceX. Sometimes, astronauts need to come back early if there is a health problem, but they always land safely in the ocean."
