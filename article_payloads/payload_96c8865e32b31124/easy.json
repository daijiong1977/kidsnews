  "title": "Uranus and Neptune: What's Inside the Blue Planets?",
  "summary": "Uranus and Neptune are two planets in our Solar System that look blue and are called ice giants. Scientists used to think they had a lot of ice inside, but new research from the University of Zurich says they might have more rock than we thought. The scientists made computer models to guess what's inside these planets. They found that Uranus and Neptune could be made of water or rock, and we don't know for sure yet. This helps explain why their magnetic fields are weird, with many poles instead of two like Earth. The study shows we need more missions to Uranus and Neptune to learn the truth about what's inside them.",

    "Uranus and Neptune are the seventh and eighth planets from the Sun, known for their blue color. They are far away and cold, making them hard to study. Scientists group planets by what they're made of: rocky ones like Earth, gas giants like Jupiter, and ice giants like Uranus and Neptune. Ice giants were thought to have lots of water ice, but new ideas suggest they might have more rock. Magnetic fields are like invisible shields around planets; Earth's has two poles, but Uranus and Neptune's are different. Missions are space trips to explore planets, and we might send more to these distant worlds to solve the mystery."
