  "title": "Toxic Exposure in Firefighting Foam at 3M Factory",
  "summary": "An investigation by BBC File on 4 has revealed that dozens of workers at a 3M factory in Swansea, Wales, were exposed to toxic chemicals over decades. The factory, which operated from 1952 to 2023, manufactured products like nappy fastenings and video tapes, employing over 1,000 people. Workers selected for the 'fire party' team used aqueous film-forming foam (AFFF) during monthly training to put out chemical fires. This foam contained PFOS and PFOA, two 'forever chemicals' that are carcinogenic and persist in the environment. 3M, a multi-billion-dollar US company, knew about the health risks but failed to inform employees. Although the company stopped manufacturing these chemicals in 2002, they remained at the site, leading to environmental contamination. In 2023, 3M closed the factory and applied for redevelopment, but a land contamination report submitted to the local council showed the site is polluted with PFOS and PFOA from historic firefighting activities. The BBC tracked down former workers, who are now speaking publicly about their experiences, highlighting issues of corporate responsibility and worker safety.",

    "This article discusses a case of long-term chemical exposure at a 3M factory in Swansea, Wales. Workers involved in firefighting training used AFFF, which contains PFOS and PFOA—toxic 'forever chemicals' linked to cancer. 3M, a major US manufacturer, was aware of the risks but did not disclose them to employees, raising concerns about corporate ethics and worker protection. The factory, operational from 1952 to 2023, left behind environmental contamination, as shown in documents submitted for redevelopment. The BBC's investigation highlights the importance of transparency in industrial safety and the lasting impact of chemical pollution on communities."
