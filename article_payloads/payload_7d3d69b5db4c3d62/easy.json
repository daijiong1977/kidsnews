  "title": "Workers Exposed to Harmful Chemicals in Firefighting Foam",
  "summary": "A factory in Swansea, Wales, had workers who were exposed to dangerous chemicals for many years. The factory, owned by a big company called 3M, made things like nappy fastenings and video tapes. Some workers were part of a 'fire party' team that practiced putting out fires using a special foam. This foam contained toxic chemicals called PFOS and PFOA, which can cause cancer and stay in the environment forever. The company knew about the risks but did not tell the workers. The factory is now closed, and the site is polluted with these chemicals from old firefighting activities. The BBC found documents showing the contamination, and workers are sharing their stories for the first time.",
