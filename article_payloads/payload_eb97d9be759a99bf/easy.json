  "title": "Many People Want to Be a New Leader in Georgia",
  "summary": "In Georgia, 22 people are trying to become the new member of Congress after Marjorie Taylor Greene left. This includes 17 Republicans, 3 Democrats, 1 Libertarian, and 1 independent. They will all be on the same ballot on March 10. If no one gets more than half the votes, the top two will have another election on April 7. The area they want to represent is very Republican and liked Greene's strong conservative ideas. Some important candidates are Clay Fuller, who was a district attorney, and Colton Moore, who was a state senator. Nicky Lama, a city council member, is also running. This election is happening because Greene resigned after five years in Congress.",

    "In the United States, Congress is part of the government that makes laws. People vote for representatives from their area to serve in Congress. Sometimes, when a representative leaves, like Marjorie Taylor Greene did, there is a special election to choose someone new. Georgia is a state in the U.S., and this election is happening in a district there. Candidates from different political parties, such as Republicans and Democrats, compete to win votes. Elections help decide who will lead and make decisions for the community."
