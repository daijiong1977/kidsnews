  "title": "What Will Happen to the BBC?",
  "summary": "The government in the UK is asking people what they think about the future of the BBC, which is a big TV and radio company. They have started a special process called a consultation to decide how the BBC should work and get money after 2027. The BBC needs a rulebook called a charter to exist, and it is time to make a new one. The government wants to make sure the BBC is strong, trusted, and has enough money to keep going. People can share their ideas on things like the licence fee, which is a payment many households make to watch TV, and whether the BBC should show ads. The BBC leader says they want to change to serve the UK better and stay independent. This is an important discussion because the BBC helps with news and entertainment for everyone.",

    "The BBC is a public service broadcaster in the UK that provides TV, radio, and online content. It is funded mainly by a licence fee paid by households that watch live TV. The government is starting a discussion called a consultation to plan the BBC's future, including how it gets money and what rules it follows. This happens every few years when the BBC's charter, which is like its permission to operate, needs to be renewed. People are invited to share their thoughts to help shape the BBC for years to come."
