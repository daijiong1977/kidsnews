    "Strictly Come Dancing is a long-running British television dance competition that pairs celebrities with professional dancers, judged on performance and technique. Drag culture, exemplified by shows like RuPaul's Drag Race, involves performers using drag as an art form to express identity and entertain. Injuries in dance are common due to physical strain, and medical withdrawals protect participants' health. The BBC, as a public broadcaster, reports entertainment news with a focus on factual accuracy and public interest, often citing official sources and social media for updates. Understanding these contexts helps analyze how media covers celebrity events and their impacts on audiences."
