  "title": "New Astronauts Join Space Station Team",
  "summary": "Four new astronauts arrived at the International Space Station on Saturday. They came in a SpaceX rocket from Cape Canaveral, Florida. The astronauts are from the United States, France, and Russia. Their names are Jessica Meir, Jack Hathaway, Sophie Adenot, and Andrei Fedyaev. They will live and work on the space station for eight to nine months. They are replacing other astronauts who had to leave early because one got sick. This is the first time NASA had to bring astronauts home early for health reasons in 65 years. The space station had only three people left, so NASA stopped spacewalks and reduced science experiments. Now, with the new crew, the station is back to full strength. The astronauts are excited to start their mission and help with research in space.",

    "The International Space Station is a large spacecraft that orbits Earth. Astronauts from different countries live there to do science experiments and learn about space. Sometimes, astronauts have to come back to Earth early if there is a health problem. NASA works with companies like SpaceX to send astronauts to space using rockets. Spacewalks are important for fixing things outside the station, but they can be dangerous, so NASA is careful about when to do them."
