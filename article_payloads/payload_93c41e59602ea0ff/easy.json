  "title": "A Leader's Chat Puts Soldiers in Danger",
  "summary": "A report from the Pentagon watchdog found that Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth used a messaging app called Signal to talk about a military strike in Yemen. This put U.S. service members at risk because the chat had secret information that should not be shared. A journalist was accidentally added to the chat, which gave real-time updates about the strike against Houthi militants. The inspector general, who investigates for the Department of Defense, said the messages were classified as 'secret/no foreign,' meaning they could harm national security if leaked. This shows how important it is to keep sensitive information safe to protect people.",

    "This article is about a report from the Pentagon, which is part of the U.S. government that handles the military. A watchdog is like a detective who checks if things are done correctly. In this case, they found that Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth used a private messaging app called Signal to talk about a military strike in Yemen. This is a country where there is a conflict. The chat had secret details that could put soldiers in danger if others saw them. A journalist, who reports news, was added to the chat by mistake, which made the information less secure. This teaches us about the importance of protecting sensitive information in government and military work."
