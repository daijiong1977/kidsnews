  "title": "A New Leader for a Big Union in the UK",
  "summary": "Andrea Egan has been chosen as the new leader of Unison, which is the largest trade union in the UK with over 1.3 million members. She won the election by getting almost 60% of the votes, even though not many members voted. Andrea Egan used to be in the Labour Party but was removed three years ago. She beat Christina McAnea, who is a friend of Prime Minister Keir Starmer. After winning, Andrea Egan said she will stand up to employers, politicians, and ministers who do not help union members. She promised to hold the Labour Party accountable and not give them easy support. Keir Starmer congratulated her and said he wants to work together. Unison helps workers in public services like schools, hospitals, and police. Andrea Egan will start her job in January for five years.",
