  "title": "Jannik Sinner Reflects on Serve Improvements After Australian Open Victory",
  "summary": "Jannik Sinner, the world number two and defending Australian Open champion, began his title defence with a straightforward first-round win against Hugo Gaston, who retired when Sinner led 6-2, 6-1. Despite his dominance, Sinner expressed concerns about his serve, stating he does not 'feel very safe' with recent changes made to his service motion and rhythm. He explained that adjustments were implemented after his US Open final loss to Carlos Alcaraz, aiming to slow down his initial motion for better control. Sinner emphasized the serve's importance as a critical shot that can dictate points, highlighting his 2025 ATP Tour leading percentage of service games won at 92%. In the match, he demonstrated strong serving with six aces, no double faults, and a 64% first-serve percentage, recovering from an early 0-40 deficit to hold serve. Sinner's performance included winning nine consecutive games, showcasing his skill but also his ongoing focus on refining his serve for future competitions.",
