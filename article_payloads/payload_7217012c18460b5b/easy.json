  "title": "Jannik Sinner Wins Tennis Match and Talks About His Serve",
  "summary": "Jannik Sinner is a top tennis player who won his first match at the Australian Open tournament. His opponent, Hugo Gaston, had to stop playing because Sinner was winning easily. Sinner says he is working on improving his serve, which is how he starts each point in tennis. He changed how he moves his arm when he serves to make it better. Even though he is good at serving, he does not feel very confident with it yet. Sinner thinks the serve is very important because it can help him win points quickly. He played well in the match, hitting many aces, which are serves that the other player cannot hit back. Sinner is happy with his win but wants to keep getting better at serving.",
