  "title": "Rebuilding the First TV: A Fun Science Story",
  "summary": "A long time ago, in 1926, a man named John Logie Baird made the first television. He showed a moving picture in a small room in London. Now, 100 years later, a team at Bournemouth University is rebuilding his old TV machine. They are using special spinning disks called Nipkow disks to make it work, just like Baird did. The team leader, Gary Toms, says Baird used simple parts like light bulbs, but today we have better technology. Baird had health problems and couldn't fight in a war, so he worked on his invention instead. People at the time thought the pictures were blurry, but they were amazed it worked at all. This story shows how inventions start small and grow big.",

    "John Logie Baird was a Scottish inventor who lived a long time ago. He worked hard to create the first television, even though he was often sick. In 1926, he showed a small, flickering picture to some scientists and reporters in London. This was a big moment because it started the TV industry we have today. Now, universities like Bournemouth are studying his work to learn about old technology and how inventions change over time. This helps us appreciate how simple ideas can lead to big changes in how we watch shows and learn things."
