  "title": "Silver Helps Make Better Batteries",
  "summary": "Scientists are working on new batteries that are safer and can hold more energy than the ones we use today. These batteries use a solid material instead of a liquid inside. But this solid material can get tiny cracks that make the battery stop working over time. Researchers at Stanford University found a way to fix this problem. They put a very thin layer of silver on the surface of the solid material and heated it. This silver layer makes the material stronger and prevents cracks from forming. This helps the battery last longer, especially when charging quickly. The scientists think this idea could help make better batteries for things like phones and electric cars in the future.",
