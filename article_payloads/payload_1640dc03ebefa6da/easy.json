  "title": "Honduras Votes for a New President with Surprise from U.S.",
  "summary": "People in Honduras voted on Sunday to choose a new president. The election was very close, with three main candidates having a chance to win. They are Moncada, who wants to help the economy for everyone; Nasralla, who says he will stop corruption; and Asfura, who supports businesses. A big surprise happened when U.S. President Donald Trump said he liked Asfura and would pardon a former Honduran president in prison. This made the election more interesting. Hondurans also voted for Congress and local leaders. They care about safety and jobs, even though the country is safer now than before. The voting day had music and flags outside schools where people lined up to vote.",
