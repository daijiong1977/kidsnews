  "title": "A Mom Leaves a Baby Group Because of Mean Comments",
  "summary": "Martina joined a baby signing class to meet other moms and teach her baby hand signs. But she felt judged by the other mothers. They did not like that she bottle-fed her son and had a C-section birth. Martina thought they saw her as a lazy mom and were competing like teenagers. She left the group after three sessions. Another mom, Ashley Tisdale, also talked about a toxic mom group where some people were left out. A doctor says being a new mom can make women feel insecure and compare themselves to others. Martina had a similar bad experience online when a mom stopped talking to her after learning about her C-section. She knows mom groups can help with loneliness but worries about judgment.",
