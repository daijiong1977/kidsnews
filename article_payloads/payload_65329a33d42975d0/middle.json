  "title": "Navigating Judgment in Motherhood Support Groups",
  "summary": "Martina, a mother in Wales, joined a baby signing class hoping to connect with other local mothers and teach her infant communication skills. However, she quickly encountered judgment from the group, who criticized her for bottle-feeding and opting for an elective caesarean section, making her feel labeled as lazy. After three sessions, she left, describing the dynamic as competitive and reminiscent of teenage cliques. This experience mirrors that of celebrity Ashley Tisdale, who recounted exclusion in a toxic mom group, highlighting a shift from her earlier positive reflections on maternal support. Dr. Noëlle Santorelli, a clinical psychologist, explains that new motherhood triggers profound identity changes, often activating insecurity, comparison, and fear of exclusion, which can manifest as subtle conflicts like gossip or passive-aggression. Martina's prior online interaction worsened her anxiety when a potential friend ceased contact after learning of her C-section. Despite these challenges, she acknowledges the value of mutual support for combating social isolation and postnatal depression, as seen with Rachel in Virginia, who sought out a moms' group for connection. The article explores the tension between the need for community and the prevalence of judgmental behaviors that can undermine support networks for new mothers.",
