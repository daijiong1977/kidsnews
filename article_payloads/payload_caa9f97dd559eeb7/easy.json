  "title": "How Food Choices Can Help Your Brain Stay Healthy",
  "summary": "Scientists studied how the food we eat might affect our brain as we get older. They looked at carbohydrates, which are a big part of our meals, like bread and fruits. They found that eating foods that make your blood sugar go up slowly, such as whole grains and fruits, can help lower the chance of getting dementia, a brain problem that makes it hard to remember things. The study used information from over 200,000 adults in the UK and followed them for more than 13 years. People who ate more of these slow-sugar foods had a 16% lower risk of Alzheimer's, a type of dementia. The researchers say choosing good carbs is important for keeping your brain healthy when you're older.",
