  "title": "Monkey Faces Tell Stories with Their Brains",
  "summary": "Scientists studied how monkeys make faces to talk to each other. They used special cameras and brain scans to watch monkeys' faces and brains. The monkeys made faces like smiling, frowning, and chewing. The scientists thought different parts of the brain would control different faces, but they found that all parts worked together for every face. This helps us understand how brains create expressions, which could help people who can't move their faces due to sickness. The study shows that making faces is more than just a reflex; it's a complex brain activity.",
