  "title": "A Leader Wants to Change How We Handle Drugs",
  "summary": "Zack Polanski, the leader of the Green Party, says we need to change the way we deal with drugs. He thinks the current rules are not working and make drugs more dangerous. Polanski wants a new system that helps people who have problems with drugs by giving them medical support instead of punishing them. He has never taken drugs or alcohol himself because he wanted to stay sober around his friends. Polanski believes that by making drugs legal, we can have safer conversations and help people get the care they need. He talks about families who have lost loved ones to drugs and supports their call for a national discussion. The prime minister criticized Polanski's ideas, but Polanski says we need a grown-up talk based on evidence to keep people safe.",
