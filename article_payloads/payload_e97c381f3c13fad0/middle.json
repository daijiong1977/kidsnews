  "title": "UK Selects Electronic Artist Look Mum No Computer for Eurovision 2024",
  "summary": "Look Mum No Computer, an electronic music artist and tech creator known for inventing unique musical instruments, has been selected by the BBC to represent the United Kingdom at the Eurovision Song Contest 2024 in Vienna. Originally named Sam Battle, he began his career as the frontman of indie rock band Zibra, performing at events like Glastonbury in 2015, before transitioning to a solo project. He expresses enthusiasm for Eurovision, citing it as an honor to join its legacy and bring joy to audiences. With 1.4 million combined social media followers, he gains attention for crafting unusual instruments such as organs from Furby toys and flame-throwing keyboards. The BBC's internal process, aided by industry experts, led to this choice, with Kalpna Patel-Knight praising his bold vision and electric performance style as emblematic of British creativity and wit. Although his song remains unrevealed, BBC Radio 2 DJ Scott Mills hints it blends diverse influences like Basshunter and Blur, suggesting a departure from the UK's typically safe entries to offer something innovative for the international stage in May.",
