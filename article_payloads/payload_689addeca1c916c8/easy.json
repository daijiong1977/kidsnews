  "title": "Tiny Holes in Bacteria Learn Like Brains",
  "summary": "Scientists at EPFL studied tiny holes called nanopores in bacteria. These holes can act in surprising ways, like letting ions pass through in one direction but not the other. The researchers found that this happens because of electrical charges inside the holes. They even made some nanopores that can learn and remember things, similar to how our brains work. This discovery could help create new kinds of computers that use ions instead of electricity, making them faster and more efficient. It's exciting because it shows how nature's designs can inspire new technology for the future.",
