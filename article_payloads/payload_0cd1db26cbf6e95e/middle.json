  "title": "Innovative Smart Synthetic Skin with Adaptive Capabilities",
  "summary": "A research team at Penn State, led by assistant professor Hongtao Sun, has developed a multifunctional smart synthetic skin using a novel fabrication technique. This material, made from hydrogel, is programmable and can perform various tasks such as hiding or revealing information, enabling adaptive camouflage, and supporting soft robotics. Inspired by cephalopods like octopuses, which dynamically control their skin appearance and texture, the team employed a 4D-printing system to create the skin. The method involves halftone-encoded printing, where digital patterns are embedded into the hydrogel to instruct its response to external triggers like heat, solvents, or stress. For example, the team encoded an image of the Mona Lisa into the skin, which becomes visible only under specific conditions like ice water or heating, demonstrating its potential for concealment and communication. Published in Nature Communications, this innovation highlights advances in material science for creating adaptable, intelligent systems.",
