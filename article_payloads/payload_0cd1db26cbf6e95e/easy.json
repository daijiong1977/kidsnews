  "title": "Smart Skin That Hides Pictures and Changes Shape",
  "summary": "Scientists at Penn State have made a new kind of smart skin that can do many cool things. It is made from a soft, water-based material called hydrogel. This smart skin can hide or show images, like the Mona Lisa painting, when it gets wet or cold. It can also change its shape and texture when touched or heated, inspired by how octopuses change their skin to hide. The scientists used a special printing method to put instructions into the material, so it knows how to react. This smart skin could help in making robots that can blend in or show messages. It is a fun invention that shows how materials can be smart and adaptable.",

    "Scientists often create new materials to solve problems. This article talks about a team at Penn State who made a smart synthetic skin that can change and react, inspired by octopuses. It is made from hydrogel and uses printing to hide images and change shape when exposed to things like water or heat. This could be used for camouflage or soft robots, showing how materials can be designed to be more adaptable and useful in different situations."
