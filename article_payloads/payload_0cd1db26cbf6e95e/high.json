  "title": "Advanced Programmable Smart Synthetic Skin with Multifunctional Responsiveness",
  "summary": "Researchers at Penn State, under the leadership of Hongtao Sun, have engineered a sophisticated smart synthetic skin through an innovative fabrication technique, resulting in a multifunctional material capable of dynamic adaptation. Constructed from hydrogel, this skin is programmable via halftone-encoded 4D-printing, which embeds binary digital instructions directly into the material's structure. Inspired by cephalopod biology, particularly octopuses that modulate skin appearance and texture for camouflage and communication, the skin exhibits tunable responses to external stimuli such as thermal changes, solvents, and mechanical stress. Key functionalities include concealing and revealing encoded images—exemplified by the Mona Lisa demonstration—altering surface texture, and modifying shape, thereby enabling applications in adaptive camouflage and soft robotics. Published in Nature Communications and highlighted by editors, this study advances material science by integrating principles from living systems into synthetic design, offering potential for next-generation intelligent materials with broad industrial and scientific implications.",
