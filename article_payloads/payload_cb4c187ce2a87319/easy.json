  "title": "Government Plan to Stop Animal Experiments",
  "summary": "The government has made a plan to stop using animals in experiments. This plan was promised in their election campaign. Animal experiments are tests done on animals to learn about diseases and medicines. The government wants to find other ways to do these tests without hurting animals. This is important because it helps protect animals and could lead to better science. Many people support this idea because they care about animal welfare. The plan will take time to put into action, and scientists will need to develop new methods. This change could make science kinder and more modern.",
