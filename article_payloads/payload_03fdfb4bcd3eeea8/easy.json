NASA has been busy with many missions, like launching science satellites and testing new airplanes. They are working hard to explore space and make new discoveries. The agency has support from the government to do these exciting things. NASA wants to show that America is a leader in space. They hope to land astronauts on the Moon by 2028 and maybe even go to Mars one day. This is all about learning more about our universe and inspiring people.",
