  "title": "A Drummer's Lucky Survival After Stage Collapse",
  "summary": "Lionel Duke, a drummer in the band The Christians, collapsed on stage during a music festival in Liverpool. He had a cardiac arrest, which means his heart stopped beating. Medics and people from the crowd quickly helped him by doing CPR to keep him alive. He was taken to a hospital and spent eight days there, including time in an induced coma to help him recover. Lionel says he feels very lucky to be alive because many people thought he might not survive. He is now back on his feet and happy to be home. This story shows how important it is to have help nearby in emergencies.",

    "A cardiac arrest is a serious medical emergency where the heart stops pumping blood. CPR, or cardiopulmonary resuscitation, is a life-saving technique that involves chest compressions to keep blood flowing until professional help arrives. Festivals like On The Waterfront in Liverpool are large public events with music performances, and having medical teams nearby is crucial for safety. Induced comas are sometimes used in hospitals to protect the brain and body during recovery from severe injuries or illnesses."
