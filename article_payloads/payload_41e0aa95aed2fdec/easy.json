  "title": "Man Pretends to Be Navy Admiral at Remembrance Event",
  "summary": "A man named Jonathan Carley dressed up as a navy admiral without permission at a Remembrance Sunday event in Llandudno, Wales. He wore a uniform with medals and pretended to be a high-ranking officer. This event is held to remember soldiers who died in wars. People at the event were worried because he was not a real admiral. The police arrested him at his home after pictures were shared online. He went to court and admitted to wearing the uniform without permission, which is against an old law from 1894. This caused concern because it disrespects the memory of fallen soldiers and the military.",

    "Remembrance Sunday is a special day in the UK and other countries to honor soldiers who died in wars. People wear poppies and lay wreaths at war memorials. Military uniforms are important symbols of service and respect. Wearing them without permission can be disrespectful and against the law. This helps kids understand why the man's actions were wrong and why the event matters."
