  "title": "UK Pays Money to Man Held in Prison Without Trial",
  "summary": "The UK government has given a lot of money to a man named Abu Zubaydah who was tortured by the CIA and is still in prison at Guantanamo Bay without a trial after almost 20 years. He was the first person to face harsh questioning by the CIA after the 9/11 attacks, and it was once said he was part of al-Qaeda, but that was later taken back. UK intelligence services, MI5 and MI6, helped the CIA by giving questions for his interrogations even though they knew he was being badly treated. Zubaydah sued the UK, saying they were involved in his torture, and now they have settled the case with money. His lawyer says the money is important but not enough, and he should be released because his rights are still being violated. The UK government won't talk about it, and the exact amount of money is secret. A politician said this settlement is very unusual but what happened was wrong. Zubaydah is a Palestinian from Saudi Arabia and has been at Guantanamo since 2006 without being charged; he is one of 15 prisoners still there despite reports of mistreatment.",

    "This article is about a man named Abu Zubaydah who was captured after the 9/11 attacks and accused of being in al-Qaeda, but that was later withdrawn. He was tortured by the CIA using harsh methods, and UK intelligence services helped by providing questions. He has been in Guantanamo Bay, a US military prison in Cuba, since 2006 without being charged or having a trial. The UK government recently paid him money to settle a legal case where he said they were involved in his torture. His lawyer and others argue he should be released because his rights are still being violated, and he is one of 15 prisoners still there."
