  "title": "A Study on Bacteria in Diabetic Foot Infections",
  "summary": "Scientists from King's College London and the University of Westminster studied E. coli bacteria found in foot infections in people with diabetes. They looked at bacteria from patients in many countries like Nigeria, the UK, and China. The study showed that these bacteria are very different from each other and not just one type. Some bacteria can resist antibiotics, making infections hard to treat. This research helps doctors understand the bacteria better so they can choose the right medicines to help patients heal faster and avoid serious problems like amputation.",

    "Diabetic foot infections are wounds on the feet of people with diabetes that can get infected with bacteria like E. coli. These infections are dangerous because they can lead to losing a foot if not treated properly. Scientists study bacteria to find out how to fight them with medicines called antibiotics. This helps keep people healthy and safe from serious harm."
