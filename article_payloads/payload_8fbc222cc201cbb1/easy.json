  "title": "Dan Evans Loses Early in Australian Open Qualifying",
  "summary": "Dan Evans, a tennis player from Great Britain, lost his first match in the Australian Open qualifying rounds. He was beaten by Rei Sakamoto from Japan with scores of 6-1 and 6-2. Evans is 35 years old and had trouble with his serve during the match. This means he won't play in the main part of the tournament this year. Other British players like Jay Clarke and Jack Pinnington Jones also lost their first matches. But some British players, Arthur Fery and George Loffhagen, won their matches. Players need to win three qualifying matches to get into the main draw, which starts soon. The article also mentions other British players who are already in the main draw or got in without qualifying.",
