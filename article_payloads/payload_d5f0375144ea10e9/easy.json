  "title": "Police Catch Men for Huge Illegal Trash Pile",
  "summary": "Two men were arrested for dumping a massive pile of trash in a field in Oxfordshire, England. The Environment Agency, which protects nature, made the arrests. The trash pile is very big, about 21,000 tonnes, and is made of things like plastic, tires, and household waste. It is one of over 500 illegal dumps in England, with some having even more trash. These dumps are often hidden in the countryside and can be dangerous, like causing fires. Police think organized crime groups run these dumps to make money by charging less than legal places. Cleaning up this site will cost £9.6 million, and the agency hopes to get the money back from the people responsible. The men were released on bail while the investigation continues.",

    "In England, there are rules about where trash can be thrown away to keep the environment safe. Legal places charge fees and follow laws, but some people break these rules by dumping trash illegally in fields or countryside areas. This can harm nature, cause pollution, and be dangerous. The Environment Agency works to stop this by investigating and arresting people who do it. Organized crime groups sometimes get involved because they can make money by charging less than legal options. Cleaning up illegal dumps is expensive and takes a long time."
