  "title": "How to Stop the War in Ukraine",
  "summary": "This article talks about the war in Ukraine and what might make Russian President Vladimir Putin stop fighting. Putin feels confident because he thinks America is becoming more friendly towards him and Russia is winning battles. Some experts say Putin wants Ukraine to give up land, reduce its army, and never join NATO. There are different ideas about what could happen next. One idea is that US President Donald Trump might push Ukraine to agree to a ceasefire that gives land to Russia, but this might not protect Ukraine in the future. If Ukraine says no or Russia disagrees, Trump might stop helping Ukraine with important information. Another idea is that the war could continue slowly. Europe is planning to help Ukraine by sending soldiers and money to rebuild, but some people think Europe should prepare for a long war that could last 15 to 20 years. Europe could also help protect Ukraine from drones and missiles. The article asks what else could change Putin's mind and what Ukraine, Europe, and China could do differently.",
