  "title": "Strategies to End the Conflict in Ukraine",
  "summary": "This article examines the ongoing war in Ukraine and explores potential strategies to persuade Russian President Vladimir Putin to halt military operations. Putin exhibits confidence due to perceived diplomatic shifts, including improved relations with the US and battlefield successes. Analysts note that Putin has little incentive to compromise, demanding Ukraine cede control over Donetsk, recognize occupied territories as Russian, limit its military capabilities, and renounce NATO membership. Several scenarios are considered: US President Donald Trump might pressure Ukraine into a ceasefire involving territorial concessions, which could lack security guarantees against future Russian aggression. If Ukraine resists or Russia vetoes, Trump could withdraw crucial US intelligence support for Ukraine. Alternatively, the conflict may persist with gradual Russian advances in eastern Ukraine. The Trump administration's national security strategy downgrades Russia from an existential threat, advocating for renewed stability with Russia. With US support uncertain, the article questions what could alter Putin's stance and what roles Ukraine, Europe, and China might play. Europe is preparing a ceasefire initiative through a 'coalition of the willing,' involving military and financial aid to deter future invasions and rebuild Ukraine. However, some officials advocate for long-term preparedness, suggesting support for a potential 15-20 year war, including enhanced drone and missile defense via the European Sky Shield Initiative.",
