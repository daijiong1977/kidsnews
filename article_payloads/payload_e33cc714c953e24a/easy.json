  "title": "How Animals Got Their Backbones",
  "summary": "Scientists have discovered a big clue about how animals with backbones, like fish and frogs, first evolved. They studied genes in animals with and without backbones. Genes are like instructions inside cells that tell them what to do. The scientists found that in animals with backbones, certain genes make more types of proteins. Proteins help cells talk to each other and grow properly. This extra variety in proteins might have helped animals develop backbones and become more complex. The research used a new method to look at genes in sea squirts, lampreys, and frogs. Sea squirts don't have backbones, lampreys are simple vertebrates, and frogs are more advanced. This finding helps explain how vertebrates came from simpler ancestors long ago.",

  "background_read": [
    "This article is about how animals with backbones, called vertebrates, first appeared on Earth. Vertebrates include many animals we know, like dogs, fish, and birds. They evolved from simpler animals without backbones, called invertebrates, such as worms or jellyfish. Scientists study genes to understand this change because genes control how animals develop. By comparing different animals, they can learn what makes vertebrates special. This research helps us know more about our own bodies and how life has changed over millions of years."
