  "title": "A Spider's Pearl Necklace: Tiny Mites on a Spider",
  "summary": "Scientists in Brazil found a tiny spider with what looked like a pearl necklace. It was actually baby mites living on the spider. This is only the second time such mites have been seen in Brazil. The mites are very small, about half a millimeter long, and they attach to young spiders. They feed on a fluid called lymph from the spider's body, especially at a weak spot called the pedicel. The spiders were found near caves in Rio de Janeiro. This discovery helps scientists learn more about these rare mites and where they live.",

    "Scientists study tiny animals like spiders and mites to understand nature. In Brazil, researchers found a spider with mite larvae that look like pearls. Mites are small bugs that can live on other animals, sometimes as parasites. This discovery is rare and helps us know more about biodiversity in South America."
