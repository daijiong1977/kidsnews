  "title": "How Muscles Help Keep Your Brain Young",
  "summary": "Scientists found that having more muscles and less belly fat deep inside your body can make your brain look younger. This means your brain stays healthier as you age. The study used special pictures from MRI machines to look at people's bodies and brains. They discovered that people with more muscle and less hidden fat had brains that seemed younger. This is important because a younger brain can help prevent diseases like Alzheimer's. The researchers say that exercising to build muscle and eat healthy to reduce belly fat can help keep your brain in good shape. It's like taking care of your body to take care of your brain too.",

    "The brain is an important organ that controls thinking and memory. As people get older, their brains can change and sometimes get sick. Scientists study how to keep brains healthy. In this article, they looked at how the body's muscles and fat affect the brain. They used MRI machines, which are like cameras for the inside of the body, to see muscles and fat. This helps us understand that taking care of our bodies by exercising and eating right can also protect our brains from diseases."
