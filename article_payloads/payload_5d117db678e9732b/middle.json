  "title": "Investigating Maternity Failures at a UK Hospital Trust",
  "summary": "This article reports on a joint investigation by BBC News and New Statesman into maternity care failures at the University Hospitals Sussex NHS Foundation Trust. It focuses on several families, including two couples who met in antenatal classes and both planned to name their sons Felix, but lost their babies under the trust's care. The investigation reveals that the trust has paid over £100 million in clinical negligence payments for maternity errors between 2021 and 2025, with £34.3 million in 2024/25 alone—the highest in England that year. Despite the trust's claim of low mortality rates and attributing high claims to its size, bereaved parents like Katie Fowler argue that the trust often convinces families that nothing could have been done, potentially hiding cases where babies could have been saved. The article highlights specific incidents, such as Beth Cooper's repeated visits to the Princess Royal Hospital with concerns about reduced fetal movements, where she was reassured and sent home despite her professional background as a neonatal nurse. An independent investigation has been expanded to include 15 families, underscoring ongoing concerns about patient safety and transparency in maternity services.",
