  "title": "President Trump Calls Back U.S. Ambassadors",
  "summary": "President Trump is asking U.S. ambassadors from about 30 countries to come back home. Ambassadors are important people who represent the United States in other countries. This is happening in many places like Africa, Asia, Europe, the Middle East, and the Western Hemisphere. The State Department says this is normal for a new president to choose ambassadors who support his \"America first\" plan. John Dinkelman, who worked as a diplomat for 37 years, talks about this move. He says it is unusual to recall so many ambassadors at once. This change is part of President Trump's way of handling foreign policy, which means how the U.S. deals with other countries.",
