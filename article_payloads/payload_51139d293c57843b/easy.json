  "title": "An Old Fossil That Might Change How We Think About Human Beginnings",
  "summary": "Scientists found a very old fossil called Sahelanthropus tchadensis that is about seven million years old. They think it could walk on two legs, which would make it the earliest human ancestor we know. The fossil was discovered in Chad, Africa, in the early 2000s. Researchers used special 3D imaging to look at its bones and found a small part called the femoral tubercle that helps with standing and walking upright. This fossil had a brain like a chimpanzee and probably lived in trees too, but it could walk on the ground. The study was done by a team from different universities and published in a science journal. This discovery helps us learn more about how humans started to walk on two legs long ago.",

    "Human ancestors are species that lived long ago and are related to modern humans. Fossils are important because they give clues about how these ancestors lived and moved. Walking on two legs, called bipedalism, is a key trait that helped humans evolve. Scientists study fossils using tools like 3D imaging to understand ancient life better."
