  "title": "New Evidence Suggests Early Human Ancestor Walked Upright Seven Million Years Ago",
  "summary": "A recent study published in Science Advances provides strong evidence that Sahelanthropus tchadensis, a species dating back about seven million years, was capable of bipedal walking, potentially making it the earliest known human ancestor. Researchers used advanced 3D imaging and analytical techniques to examine fossils discovered in the Djurab desert of Chad in the early 2000s. They identified a femoral tubercle, a skeletal feature linked to the iliofemoral ligament crucial for upright posture, along with other anatomical traits like femoral antetorsion and a gluteal complex that support bipedal movement. The analysis also compared limb proportions, showing Sahelanthropus had a longer femur relative to its ulna, resembling early hominins like Australopithecus more than apes. Lead author Scott Williams notes that Sahelanthropus was a bipedal ape with a chimpanzee-sized brain that likely spent time in trees but adapted to ground movement. This collaborative research involved scientists from multiple institutions and addresses long-standing debates about the species' locomotion, offering insights into the early evolution of bipedalism in the human lineage.",

    "Human evolution involves the development of traits like bipedalism over millions of years. Fossils such as Sahelanthropus tchadensis help scientists trace this history. Bipedalism allowed early humans to free their hands for tool use and other activities. The study of fossils often uses techniques like 3D imaging to analyze bone structures without damaging them. Debates in paleoanthropology center on when and how bipedalism evolved, with new discoveries constantly reshaping our understanding."
