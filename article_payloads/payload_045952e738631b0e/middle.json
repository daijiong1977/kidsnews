  "title": "Amateur Triumph at Australian Open's Innovative Tennis Event",
  "summary": "In a surprising turn of events at the Australian Open's Million Dollar One Point Slam, amateur player Jordan Smith secured a A$1 million prize by defeating world-class tennis professionals. Smith, a New South Wales state champion, outperformed defending Australian Open champion Jannik Sinner and women's world number four Amanda Anisimova during the innovative tournament held at Rod Laver Arena in Melbourne. The format allowed amateur participants to compete in single-point matches against top-ranked players and celebrities, drawing a crowd of 10,000. Smith's journey culminated in a final against Joanna Garland, who had herself upset higher-ranked players like Alexander Zverev and Nick Kyrgios. Another amateur, Queensland state champion Alec Reverente, also made headlines by beating Felix Auger-Aliassime and later winning a car in a head-to-head match with Smith. The event fostered a spirited atmosphere, with even defeated players like Carlos Alcaraz staying to watch the amateur finalists, highlighting the tournament's unique appeal and the growing interest in inclusive tennis competitions.",
