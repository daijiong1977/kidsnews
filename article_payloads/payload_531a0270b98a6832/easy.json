  "title": "North Korea Fires Missiles Before South Korean Leader's Trip",
  "summary": "North Korea launched several ballistic missiles into the sea near its coast on a Sunday morning. This happened just before the president of South Korea left for a visit to China. South Korea and Japan, which are neighbors, said the missiles flew about 900 kilometers and broke rules set by the United Nations. They asked North Korea to stop these actions and talk about peace. The United States said the missiles were not an immediate danger but promised to protect its friends. Experts think North Korea is showing off its weapons before a big meeting of its ruling party. South Korea's president went to China to ask for help in making peace on the Korean Peninsula, where North and South Korea are divided. China is a close friend and trading partner of North Korea, so South Korea hopes China can influence North Korea to talk instead of testing missiles.",

    "North Korea and South Korea are two countries on the Korean Peninsula that have been divided since the Korean War in the 1950s. They often have tensions, with North Korea testing missiles and having nuclear weapons. The United Nations has rules against such tests to keep peace. China is a powerful country nearby that is friends with North Korea and trades with it. South Korea and the United States are allies who want North Korea to stop its weapons programs and talk for peace. This article talks about a recent missile test by North Korea and how it relates to South Korea's leader visiting China to ask for help."
