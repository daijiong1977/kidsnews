  "title": "Kylie Minogue Achieves Christmas Chart Victory",
  "summary": "Kylie Minogue has secured the Christmas number one spot in the UK charts this year with her single XMAS, ending Wham!'s reign with Last Christmas. The song, featured on an expanded edition of her 2015 album Kylie Christmas, was exclusively available on Amazon Music, giving it a promotional edge by being highlighted on Christmas playlists. This strategic move contributed to her success, alongside sales of limited edition vinyl and CD singles and plays on YouTube. Martin Talbot of the Official Charts Company noted that Kylie and her record label aggressively targeted this achievement, resulting in her biggest sales week in 23 years. The competition was intense, with only 10,000 copies separating the top five songs at one point, and contenders included Mariah Carey and Brenda Lee. This victory marks Kylie as the first female artist to top the charts across four different decades, a milestone in her long career that began with her first UK number one in 1988.",
