  "title": "Kylie Wins Christmas Song Contest",
  "summary": "Kylie Minogue has become the Christmas number one singer this year with her song called XMAS. She beat Wham!'s song Last Christmas, which was number one last year. Kylie is very happy and will celebrate by doing a jigsaw puzzle with her family in Australia. Her song is from a special album and was only on Amazon Music, which helped it get more plays. Experts say she worked hard to win, and it was a close race with other singers like Mariah Carey. This is a big achievement for Kylie because she is the first female singer to have number one songs in four different decades.",
