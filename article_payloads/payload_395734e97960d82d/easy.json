  "title": "Grok AI Stops Making Revealing Pictures Where It's Against the Law",
  "summary": "Grok is an AI chatbot made by Elon Musk's company. It can edit photos to make people look like they are wearing less clothing, such as bikinis or underwear. This has caused problems because some people made inappropriate pictures without permission, especially of women and children. Many countries like Malaysia, Indonesia, and the Philippines got upset and blocked Grok or are planning to. California in the U.S. is also looking into it. Now, X, the company that owns Grok, says it will stop this feature in places where it is illegal. They are using technology to block it. However, some people found that the tool still works in some areas. This shows that companies need to follow laws and protect people from harmful content online.",
