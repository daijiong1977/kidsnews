  "title": "A New Superconductor That Breaks the Rules",
  "summary": "Scientists have found a special material called platinum-bismuth-two (PtBi2) that acts in a surprising way. This shiny gray crystal has electrons that behave differently than in other materials. At low temperatures, electrons on the top and bottom surfaces pair up to flow without resistance, making it a superconductor, while the inside stays normal. This creates a sandwich-like structure. The electrons pair in a unique pattern with six directions, which has never been seen before. This discovery could help build better quantum computers in the future by using elusive particles called Majorana particles. The research was done by a team in Germany using high-tech measurements to study the material's properties.",

    "Superconductors are materials that can conduct electricity perfectly without losing energy, usually at very cold temperatures. They are used in things like MRI machines and maglev trains. Quantum computers are advanced machines that use quantum bits to solve problems much faster than regular computers. Majorana particles are special particles that might make quantum computers more reliable. This article talks about a new superconductor that could help improve technology."
