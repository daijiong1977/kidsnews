  "title": "UN Chief Criticizes US for Prioritizing Power Over International Law",
  "summary": "In an interview with the BBC, UN Secretary-General António Guterres accused the United States of acting with impunity and believing that its power outweighs the importance of international law. He stated that Washington holds a clear conviction that multilateral solutions are irrelevant, emphasizing instead the exercise of US power and influence, sometimes at the expense of international norms. This criticism follows recent US actions, such as strikes in Venezuela and threats to annex Greenland under President Trump. Guterres expressed concern that the founding principles of the UN, including the equality of member states, are under threat. He admitted the UN struggles to enforce the UN Charter due to the greater leverage of big powers like the US, questioning whether this leverage leads to lasting solutions or just quick fixes. Additionally, he called for UN reform to address global challenges, suggesting the Security Council is ineffective and no longer representative. Trump's past criticisms of the UN, where he claimed it failed to help in conflicts, add context to this tension.",

    "The United Nations, established after World War II, aims to promote international cooperation and peace through the UN Charter, which includes principles like sovereign equality. Multilateralism involves countries collaborating on global issues, but powerful nations like the US sometimes prioritize unilateral actions, challenging this system. The UN Security Council, with five permanent members including the US, has authority to enforce decisions, but critics argue it is outdated and influenced by big power politics. Recent US foreign policy under President Trump has emphasized America First, leading to tensions with international institutions. Understanding these dynamics helps explain Guterres' concerns about power imbalances and the need for UN reform."
