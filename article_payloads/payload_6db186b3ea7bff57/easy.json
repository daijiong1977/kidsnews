  "title": "UN Leader Says US Thinks Power Is More Important Than Rules",
  "summary": "The leader of the United Nations, António Guterres, told the BBC that the United States believes its power is more important than following international rules. He said the US thinks working together with other countries doesn't matter and that using its strength is what counts. This comes after the US took actions in Venezuela and talked about taking Greenland. Guterres worries that the UN's ideas, like all countries being equal, are in danger. He admitted the UN has trouble making countries follow the rules because big powers like the US have more influence. He wants the UN to change to help solve big problems better.",

    "The United Nations (UN) is a group of countries that tries to keep peace and make rules for everyone to follow. International laws are rules that countries agree on to work together. Sometimes, big countries like the US use their power instead of following these rules, which can make it hard for the UN to do its job. António Guterres is the leader of the UN, and he is worried about this problem."
