  "title": "AI Accelerates Search for Sustainable Magnetic Materials",
  "summary": "Researchers at the University of New Hampshire have developed an AI system to accelerate the discovery of advanced magnetic materials, creating a searchable database called the Northeast Materials Database with 67,573 magnetic compounds. This includes 25 previously unrecognized materials that maintain magnetism at high temperatures. The project aims to reduce reliance on rare earth elements, which are costly, largely imported, and difficult to secure for powerful magnets used in electric vehicles, renewable-energy systems, and other technologies. The AI reads scientific papers to extract experimental data, trains models to predict magnetic properties, and organizes results into a comprehensive resource. Published in Nature Communications, the study highlights how this approach tackles the challenge of testing millions of element combinations in labs. The team, including lead author Suman Itani and professor Jiadong Zang, believes the database and AI technologies will help find sustainable alternatives to permanent magnets, potentially lowering costs and strengthening U.S. manufacturing. Supported by the U.S. Department of Energy, the research also explores broader applications in education, such as updating library collections.",

    "Magnetic materials are essential in modern technology, powering devices from electric vehicles to medical equipment. However, the strongest magnets often rely on rare earth elements like neodymium, which are expensive, geopolitically sensitive due to limited global supply, and environmentally taxing to mine. This has driven research into finding sustainable alternatives. Artificial intelligence (AI) is increasingly used in materials science to analyze vast datasets and predict properties, speeding up discovery processes that would otherwise require extensive lab testing. In this context, the University of New Hampshire team leveraged AI to create a database of magnetic compounds, aiming to identify new materials that can replace rare earth-based magnets. Their work not only advances scientific knowledge but also has practical implications for reducing costs and enhancing energy independence in manufacturing."
