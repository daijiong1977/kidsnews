  "title": "Finding New Magnets with Computers",
  "summary": "Scientists at the University of New Hampshire are using artificial intelligence, or AI, to help find new magnetic materials. Magnets are important for things like electric cars and phones, but many strong magnets today use rare earth elements that are expensive and hard to get. The scientists created a big database with information about 67,573 magnetic materials, including 25 new ones that can stay magnetic even when hot. They used AI to read science papers and learn about these materials. This work could help make electric cars cheaper and reduce the need for rare earths. The team hopes their database and AI tools will help discover more sustainable magnets in the future.",

    "Magnets are used in many everyday things like toys, phones, and cars. They attract metal and help machines work. Some magnets are made from rare earth elements, which are special metals found in only a few places in the world. This makes them expensive and sometimes hard to get. Scientists are looking for new materials to make magnets that are cheaper and easier to find. Artificial intelligence, or AI, is a tool that uses computers to learn from information and solve problems quickly. In this article, scientists used AI to search for new magnetic materials in a big database, which could help make technology better and more affordable."
