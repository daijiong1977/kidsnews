  "title": "Courts Help Wind Farms Build Again in the Ocean",
  "summary": "In the United States, some wind farms are being built in the ocean to make clean energy. The government tried to stop them by saying it was a secret safety problem. But five different courts said no, the government's reason didn't make sense. The judges allowed the wind farms to keep building because stopping suddenly would hurt the companies. The wind farms are almost finished, so they might be done before the government can try to stop them again. This is good for making energy from wind instead of polluting sources.",

    "Wind farms use big turbines to catch wind and turn it into electricity, which is a clean way to power homes and schools. In the US, some are built in the ocean where the wind is strong. The government sometimes makes rules about building things, and courts help decide if those rules are fair. This article talks about a time when the government tried to stop ocean wind farms, but courts said it was okay to keep building them."
