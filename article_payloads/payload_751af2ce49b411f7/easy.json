  "title": "U.S. Seizes Oil Tanker to Stop Illegal Smuggling",
  "summary": "The U.S. government recently seized a big oil tanker called the Skipper near Venezuela. This ship was part of a secret group of old tankers that smuggle oil for countries like Venezuela, Russia, and Iran, which are under U.S. sanctions. These ships hide their locations by turning off or faking their tracking systems, making it hard to know where they are. The seizure is part of President Trump's plan to pressure Venezuela's leader, Nicolás Maduro, by cutting off money from oil sales. Experts say this action might scare other smugglers and make it riskier to break the rules. The tanker was carrying millions of dollars worth of illegal crude oil, and U.S. commandos used helicopters to take control of it. This shows the U.S. is getting tougher on stopping illegal oil trade.",

    "This article is about how the U.S. is stopping illegal oil smuggling. Oil is a valuable resource used for energy, and some countries break rules to sell it. The U.S. uses sanctions, which are like punishments, to pressure countries like Venezuela. Ships sometimes hide to avoid getting caught, but the U.S. is using technology and soldiers to find and seize them. This helps control trade and support fair rules."
