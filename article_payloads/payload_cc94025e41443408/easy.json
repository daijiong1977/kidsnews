  "title": "Hair Extensions and Hidden Chemicals",
  "summary": "Scientists found many chemicals in hair extensions that could be harmful to health. Hair extensions are products people wear to make their hair look longer or different. The study tested 43 popular hair extension brands and found over 900 chemical signs, including some linked to cancer and hormone problems. Black women use hair extensions more often than other groups, which means they might face higher risks. The chemicals can touch the skin or be breathed in when extensions are heated. Companies do not always tell people what chemicals are in the extensions. Researchers say we need better rules to keep people safe and help companies make safer products.",

    "Hair extensions are popular beauty products used by many people, especially black women, to change their hairstyle. They can be made from synthetic materials or human hair. Sometimes, chemicals are added to make them flame-resistant or waterproof, but these chemicals might not be safe. Scientists study these products to check for harmful substances that could cause health problems like cancer. It's important for consumers to know what's in the products they use and for companies to be honest about ingredients."
