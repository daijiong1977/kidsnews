  "summary": "Melania Trump, the former first lady of the United States, has released a documentary titled 'Melania: Twenty Days to History,' which chronicles the 20-day period leading up to her husband Donald Trump's second inauguration. This film is notable as it marks the first instance where a sitting first lady has been the central subject of such a documentary, and Melania served as its producer. At the premiere, she expressed her intention to demonstrate the transition from private life to the public role of first lady. The documentary was acquired by Amazon for approximately $40 million in rights, with an additional $35 million allocated for marketing, highlighting its commercial significance. The article also includes brief mentions of unrelated news items, such as Oscar nominations and weather incidents, but the primary focus remains on Melania's film and its context within political and media landscapes.",

Inaugurations are key political events symbolizing the transfer of power. The article touches on broader news to provide context, but the core is Melania's personal and professional venture into filmmaking."
