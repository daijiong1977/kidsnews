  "title": "Melania Trump's New Movie About Becoming First Lady",
  "summary": "Melania Trump, the wife of former US President Donald Trump, has made a new documentary film. The film is called 'Melania: Twenty Days to History' and shows her life in the 20 days before her husband's second inauguration as president. This is special because it is the first time a sitting first lady has been in such a movie. Melania produced the film herself. At the movie's premiere, she walked on a black carpet with her husband and said she wanted to show people what it is like to become first lady again. The film was sold to Amazon for a lot of money, about $40 million, and they spent more on advertising it. The article also talks about other news, like actors nominated for awards and weather events, but the main story is about Melania's film.",
