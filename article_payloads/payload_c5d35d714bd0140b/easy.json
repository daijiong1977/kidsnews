  "title": "UK Economy Grows Slowly at End of 2025",
  "summary": "In the last part of 2025, the UK economy grew by only 0.1%, which is a very small increase. This means the economy was not doing very well. The Office for National Statistics (ONS) said that the services sector, which is a big part of the economy, did not grow at all for the first time in over two years. The construction sector had its worst performance in four years, with a big drop in building new houses. However, manufacturing helped a little by increasing. Overall, the growth was called 'subdued,' which means it was weak. The government wants to grow the economy more, but it is still slow. Some companies like Jaguar Land Rover helped by making cars again after a cyber-attack, but others held back on spending because they were unsure about taxes. Experts say the economy lacks momentum, but the government believes it has a good plan for the future.",

    "The UK economy is how much the country produces and earns. Growth means it is getting bigger, which is good for jobs and money. The services sector includes things like shops and banks, while construction builds houses. When growth is 'subdued,' it is slow and not very strong. The government tries to help the economy grow by making plans, but sometimes things like cyber-attacks or tax worries can slow it down. Understanding this helps us see how countries work to improve."
