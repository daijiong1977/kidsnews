  "title": "UK Economic Growth Remains Weak in Late 2025",
  "summary": "The UK economy experienced subdued growth of 0.1% in the final quarter of 2025, slightly below expectations, according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS). This weak performance was driven by a lack of growth in the services sector, which accounts for over 80% of economic output and saw no expansion for the first time in over two years. Meanwhile, the construction sector suffered its worst quarterly decline in four years, with a 2.1% drop, largely due to reduced new housing and repair work. Manufacturing provided a slight boost, but overall economic momentum remained low. For the entire year of 2025, the economy grew by 1.3%, up from 1.1% in 2024 but below the Bank of England's forecast of 1.4%. Factors influencing the quarter included Jaguar Land Rover resuming production after a cyber-attack, which helped, but uncertainty ahead of the November Budget, with speculation about tax changes, caused companies to delay investment. ONS director Liz McKeown described the growth as 'subdued,' while economist Ruth Gregory called it 'disappointing' and indicative of little momentum. Chancellor Rachel Reeves argued that government policies have set the stage for interest rate cuts and positioned the UK as the fastest-growing economy in the G7 in Europe.",

    "The UK economy is measured by Gross Domestic Product (GDP), which tracks the total value of goods and services produced. Growth rates indicate economic health, with higher rates suggesting prosperity. The services sector dominates the UK economy, including finance, retail, and tourism, while construction involves building infrastructure. Economic data is collected by the Office for National Statistics (ONS) through surveys and reports. Factors like business investment, consumer spending, and government policies influence growth. Understanding these concepts helps analyze economic trends and their impact on jobs and living standards."
