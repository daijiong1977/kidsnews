  "summary": "Joanna Trollope, a best-selling British author, has passed away at the age of 82, as announced by her family. Known as the 'queen of the Aga saga,' she wrote novels focusing on romance and intrigue in middle England, though she found the label patronizing. Her daughters stated she died peacefully at her Oxfordshire home. Trollope authored over 20 contemporary novels, including popular titles like The Rector's Wife and Sense & Sensibility, part of the Austen Project. Her books have been translated into more than 25 languages and adapted for television. Additionally, she wrote 10 historical novels under the pseudonym Caroline Harvey and contributed to short stories, magazines, and anthologies. Trollope was active in charity work, receiving an OBE in 1996 and a CBE in 2019 for her services to literature. She was a fifth-generation niece of novelist Anthony Trollope, admiring his work. Her literary agent and publisher praised her as a cherished and acclaimed writer, highlighting her wit and determination. Trollope's death is mourned by her family, friends, and readers worldwide.",
