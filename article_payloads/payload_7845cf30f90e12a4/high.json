  "title": "Joanna Trollope: An Obituary on the Demise of a Literary Icon",
  "summary": "Joanna Trollope, an esteemed British novelist, has died at the age of 82, as confirmed by her family in a public statement. Renowned as the 'queen of the Aga saga,' a term she deemed patronizing, Trollope specialized in contemporary fiction exploring romance and societal dynamics in middle England. Her daughters announced her peaceful death at her Oxfordshire residence. Over a career spanning more than five decades, Trollope authored over 20 contemporary novels, including notable works such as The Rector's Wife and her contribution to the Austen Project with Sense & Sensibility. She also produced 10 historical novels under the pseudonym Caroline Harvey, demonstrating her versatility. Her literary output extended to short stories, magazine pieces, and edited anthologies like The Country Habit, alongside non-fiction such as Britannia's Daughters. Trollope's books have achieved international reach, translated into over 25 languages and adapted for television, underscoring her widespread appeal. Recognized for her philanthropic efforts, she received an OBE in 1996 and a CBE in 2019, honoring her services to charity and literature. As a fifth-generation niece of Anthony Trollope, she acknowledged his influence while carving her own distinct legacy. Tributes from her literary agent and publisher highlight her astute judgement and enduring impact, mourning her loss among family, friends, and a global readership.",
