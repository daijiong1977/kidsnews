  "title": "Iran's Leader Warns About a Big Fight in the Middle East",
  "summary": "Iran's top leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, said that if the United States attacks Iran, it could start a big war in the Middle East. This happened as the U.S. sent warships to the area because of protests in Iran. The protests began over money problems but grew to challenge the leader's rule. Khamenei called the protests a 'coup' and said they attacked important places like police stations and banks. He warned that Iran would fight back if attacked, but does not want to start a war. The U.S. president, Donald Trump, said he hopes to make a deal with Iran instead of fighting. This situation makes people worried about more violence in the region.",

    "The Middle East is a region with many countries, and Iran is one of them. Sometimes, countries have disagreements that can lead to fights or wars. Protests happen when people are unhappy with their government, like if they don't have enough money. Leaders like Ayatollah Ali Khamenei make important decisions for Iran, and the U.S. president, Donald Trump, leads the United States. When tensions rise, it can make people scared of violence."
