  "summary": "Two American officials, Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner, met with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Moscow to discuss ending the war in Ukraine. The meeting lasted five hours, but no agreement was reached yet. The U.S. is trying to help Ukraine and Russia make peace, but it's hard because Ukraine might have to give up some land. Ukrainian President Zelenskyy says Putin is stopping peace, but he likes that the U.S. is talking to Russia. The war has been going on for a long time, and people hope these talks can bring peace soon.",
