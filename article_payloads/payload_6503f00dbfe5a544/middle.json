  "title": "U.S. and Russian Leaders Discuss Ukraine Peace Plan in Moscow Meeting",
  "summary": "U.S. special envoy Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner, the president's son-in-law, met with Russian President Vladimir Putin at the Kremlin for a five-hour negotiation session aimed at ending Russia's war with Ukraine. The Kremlin reported that no compromise has been reached yet, with a Putin aide stating that peace is 'no closer, but no further away.' Ukrainian and U.S. officials claim progress has been made in recent talks on a U.S.-backed peace deal, but European sources indicate the U.S. is still pressuring Ukraine to concede parts of Donetsk province, a contentious issue. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy criticized Putin for obstructing peace but supported the U.S. diplomatic efforts. The meeting highlights ongoing international efforts to resolve the conflict, which has persisted for over a decade, with complex geopolitical stakes involving territorial disputes and global alliances.",

    "The Russia-Ukraine war began in 2014 with Russia's annexation of Crimea and escalated into a full-scale invasion in 2022. The conflict involves deep historical, cultural, and political tensions, with Ukraine seeking to maintain its sovereignty and territorial integrity. International efforts, led by the U.S. and European Union, have included sanctions on Russia and diplomatic talks to broker peace. Key issues include the status of regions like Donetsk and Luhansk, where pro-Russian separatists have fought Ukrainian forces. Understanding this context is crucial for grasping the complexities of current negotiations, as global powers navigate alliances and humanitarian concerns in seeking a resolution."
