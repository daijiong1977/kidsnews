  "title": "Learning Romanian in School: A New Idea for Kids",
  "summary": "Some people want schools to teach Romanian as a subject for exams called GCSEs. Romanian is the second most spoken language in London after English, with 159,000 speakers, according to a recent survey. A historian named Dr Tessa Dunlop started a campaign to make this happen, and she is supported by a politician, Gareth Thomas. They say it would help children from Romanian families feel proud and connected to their culture. For example, a teenager named Mara, who learns Romanian at home, thinks it's important so kids can talk to their families and celebrate diversity. The government says exam boards decide which languages to offer, but they are encouraging language learning in primary schools. This campaign shows how languages bring people together.",

    "In the UK, GCSEs are exams that students take around age 16 in subjects like math and science. Languages like French or Spanish are often offered. Romanian is a language from Romania, a country in Europe. Many people from Romania have moved to London, making it a diverse city where different cultures mix. Learning languages helps people understand each other and feel proud of where they come from. This article talks about why some people want Romanian added as a school subject to help kids connect with their heritage."
