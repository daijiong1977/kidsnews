  "title": "Germany's Exciting Tennis Win",
  "summary": "Germany had a very exciting tennis match in the Davis Cup, which is a big team competition. They played against Argentina and were losing at first, but then they made a great comeback to win. In the doubles match, Kevin Krawietz and Tim Puetz saved three match points, which means they were almost out of the game, but they fought hard and won in a tie-break. Alexander Zverev also helped by winning his singles match. Now, Germany will play against Spain in the semi-finals. The players were very happy and said it was an incredible match. This win is special because Germany hasn't been in the final since 1993. Tennis is a fun sport where players hit a ball over a net, and teams work together to score points.",
