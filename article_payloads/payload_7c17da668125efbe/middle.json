  "title": "Germany's Dramatic Davis Cup Victory",
  "summary": "In a highly competitive Davis Cup quarter-final, Germany staged an impressive comeback to defeat Argentina 2-1, securing a spot in the semi-finals against Spain. The match hinged on the doubles rubber, where German pair Kevin Krawietz and Tim Puetz faced immense pressure, saving three match points in a tense final-set tie-break to win 4-6, 6-4, 7-6 (12-10). Earlier, Argentina had taken the lead with Tomas Etcheverry's strong performance in singles, but Alexander Zverev leveled the tie by defeating Francisco Cerundolo. Zverev, though not at his peak, delivered crucial points in tie-breaks. The doubles match was a rollercoaster, with Germany missing four match points before clinching victory. This win is significant as Germany aims for their first final since 1993, highlighting the team's resilience. Meanwhile, Spain advanced by beating the Czech Republic, setting up an exciting semi-final in Bologna. The Davis Cup emphasizes national pride and team dynamics in tennis.",
