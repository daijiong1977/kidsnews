  "title": "How Statins Can Cause Muscle Pain",
  "summary": "Statins are medicines that help lower cholesterol and prevent heart attacks and strokes for many people. But some patients get muscle pain or weakness from taking them. Scientists from the University of British Columbia and University of Wisconsin-Madison have found out why this happens. They used a special microscope to see how statins interact with a protein in muscle cells called the ryanodine receptor. This protein controls calcium flow in muscles. When statins bind to it, they make the protein stay open, causing calcium to leak out. This leak can damage muscle tissue and lead to pain. The study was published in Nature Communications and could help make safer statins in the future.",

    "Statins are common medicines used by millions to lower cholesterol and reduce heart disease risk. Cholesterol is a waxy substance in blood that can clog arteries if too high, leading to heart attacks or strokes. Muscles need calcium to contract and move properly, but imbalances can cause pain. Scientists use tools like microscopes to see tiny parts of cells and understand how drugs work. This research aims to improve medicines so people can stay healthy without side effects."
