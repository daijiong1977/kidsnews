  "title": "Frida Kahlo's Record-Breaking Auction Sale",
  "summary": "A surrealist self-portrait by Mexican artist Frida Kahlo, titled El sueño (la cama), was sold for $54.7 million at a Sotheby's auction, setting a new record for the highest price paid for a work by a female artist. The painting, created in the 1940s, depicts Kahlo asleep in a bed with a skeleton and dynamite overhead, reflecting her psychological turmoil during a difficult period in her life, including the assassination of a former lover and her divorce. This sale surpassed the previous record of $44 million for Georgia O'Keeffe's painting and Kahlo's own record of $34.9 million. Initially sold for $51,000 in 1980, the painting's value increased over 1,000 times, highlighting the growing appreciation for women in art. Anna Di Stasi of Sotheby's emphasized that this result marks progress in recognizing female artists. Kahlo's works are rare in the market due to Mexican laws protecting them as national monuments, adding to their allure. Her art often explores themes of pain and identity, influenced by her disabilities from polio and a bus accident.",

    "Frida Kahlo (1907-1954) was a prominent Mexican painter known for her vivid self-portraits that blend surrealism with personal narrative. Her life was marked by physical suffering; she contracted polio as a child and sustained severe injuries in a bus accident at age 18, leading to chronic pain and multiple surgeries. These experiences deeply influenced her art, which often explores themes of identity, pain, and mortality. Kahlo was married to Diego Rivera, another famous artist, and their tumultuous relationship is reflected in her work. In the 1980s, the Mexican government designated her artworks as national artistic monuments, restricting their export and making them scarce in international auctions. The art market has evolved, with increased attention to female artists; for instance, Georgia O'Keeffe previously held the auction record. Sotheby's, founded in 1744, is a key player in high-stakes art sales, and records like this highlight shifts in cultural valuation and gender equity in art history."
