  "title": "Frida Kahlo's Painting Sells for a Lot of Money",
  "summary": "A painting by Frida Kahlo, a famous artist from Mexico, was sold for $54.7 million at an auction. This is the highest price ever paid for a painting by a woman. The painting is called El sueño (la cama), which means The Dream (The Bed). It shows Frida sleeping in a bed with a skeleton and dynamite above her. This painting was made in the 1940s and sold for much more than it did in 1980. Frida Kahlo is known for her self-portraits that show her feelings and pain from being sick and hurt in a bus accident. The auction house, Sotheby's, said this sale shows that people now value women artists more. This broke the old record set by another artist, Georgia O'Keeffe. It's a big deal because not many of Frida's paintings are sold since Mexico protects them as important art.",

    "Frida Kahlo was a Mexican artist born in 1907 who painted many pictures of herself. She had a hard life because she got sick with polio as a child and was badly hurt in a bus accident. Her paintings often show her pain and feelings. She used bright colors and strange images, like skeletons, to tell stories about her life. In the 1980s, Mexico said her art was very important and should not be taken out of the country. This made her paintings rare and valuable. Auctions are events where people bid money to buy art, and Sotheby's is a well-known auction house. This sale helps us see that women artists are getting more recognition in the art world."
