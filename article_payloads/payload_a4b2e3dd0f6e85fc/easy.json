  "title": "A Company That Helped Blind People Lost Its Job",
  "summary": "A long time ago, a company called Clarity started to give jobs to blind people. They made soap for many years. But five years ago, the company had to close because it ran out of money. Over a hundred workers, many of whom were blind, lost their jobs and did not get paid what they were owed. The owner was accused of taking the workers' pension money. Now, a former worker named Camilla has started a new business called Amplify Goods. This new company helps homeless people, disabled people, and those leaving prison by giving them paid work experience packing soap. Camilla wants to continue helping people like Clarity did, but in a better way.",

    "Clarity was a social enterprise, which is a business that tries to help people while making money. It started in 1854 to give jobs to blind people, who often find it hard to get work. Over time, it made soap and had famous supporters. But in 2020, it closed because of money problems, hurting many workers. Now, a former worker has started Amplify Goods to help others in need, showing that helping people can continue even after a business fails."
