  "title": "The Clintons Agree to Talk About Jeffrey Epstein",
  "summary": "Bill Clinton, a former US president, and Hillary Clinton, a former secretary of state, have agreed to testify in a congressional investigation about Jeffrey Epstein, a man who was a sex offender. This happened just before a vote that could have held them in contempt for not appearing earlier. They had refused to go because they said they didn't know much about Epstein and thought it was a political trick. Bill Clinton knew Epstein a long time ago but says he stopped talking to him 20 years ago and didn't know about the bad things Epstein did. Now, they will answer questions from a committee in Congress, which is a big deal because it's the first time a former president has done this since 1983. The vote to hold them in contempt has been postponed while they figure out the details of their testimony.",

    "This article is about Bill and Hillary Clinton, who are important people in US politics. Bill was president from 1993 to 2001, and Hillary was a senator and secretary of state. Jeffrey Epstein was a wealthy man who was accused of sex crimes and died in prison in 2019. Congress is part of the US government that makes laws and investigates things. Sometimes, if people don't cooperate with Congress, they can be held in contempt, which is a way to punish them. This story shows how politicians sometimes argue about investigations and how they agree to talk to avoid trouble."
