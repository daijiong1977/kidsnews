  "title": "Clintons Agree to Congressional Testimony on Epstein Amid Contempt Threat",
  "summary": "Bill Clinton, former US president, and Hillary Clinton, former secretary of state, have agreed to testify before the House Oversight Committee in the congressional investigation into Jeffrey Epstein, a convicted sex offender who died in prison in 2019. This decision comes just before a scheduled vote to hold the Clintons in criminal contempt for their previous refusal to appear, following a months-long standoff. The Clintons had resisted the committee's demands, arguing that they had already provided sworn statements with limited information on Epstein and dismissing the summonses as a political ploy orchestrated by former President Trump. Bill Clinton has acknowledged a past acquaintance with Epstein but denies any knowledge of his sex offending and claims he severed contact two decades ago. The testimony marks a significant event, as it will be the first time a former president has testified to a congressional panel since Gerald Ford in 1983. After the Clintons' agreement, the contempt vote was postponed to allow for clarification of the terms of their testimony. The House Oversight Committee, led by Republicans with some Democratic support, continues to seek details on what the Clintons know about Epstein's activities.",

  "background_read": [
    "This article discusses a high-profile political investigation involving Bill and Hillary Clinton, two prominent figures in US history. Bill Clinton served as the 42nd president from 1993 to 2001, and Hillary Clinton was a US senator, secretary of state under President Obama, and the Democratic presidential nominee in 2016. Jeffrey Epstein was a financier convicted of sex trafficking who died in jail in 2019 under suspicious circumstances, leading to ongoing investigations into his network. The House Oversight Committee is a key part of the US Congress that conducts oversight of the executive branch, and it has the power to issue subpoenas and hold individuals in contempt for non-compliance. Contempt of Congress is a serious charge that can result in fines or imprisonment, though it is rarely enforced. This case highlights tensions between political parties, with Republicans leading the investigation and some Democrats supporting it, reflecting broader issues of accountability and transparency in government."
