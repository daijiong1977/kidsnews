  "title": "Families Struggle with High Energy Bills in America",
  "summary": "This article tells the story of Kristy Hallowell, a mom from New York who lost her job and then saw her energy bill jump to $1,800 a month. She couldn't pay, so her gas and electricity were turned off for six months. She, her two kids, and her mom had to use a generator to light and heat their house. Now, her electricity is back on with help from a local group, but she still owes $3,000 and worries about another shut-off. Many other American families are also behind on their bills because energy prices have gone up a lot. The article says that electricity prices rose 6.9% in one year, which is faster than other prices. President Trump says costs are falling, but some experts think his actions might make bills higher. The government is also cutting help for low-income people to pay their bills.",
