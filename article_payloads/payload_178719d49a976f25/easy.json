  "title": "Artists Cancel Shows at Kennedy Center After Name Change",
  "summary": "This article talks about news from Tuesday. More artists are canceling their shows at the Kennedy Center, a big arts building in Washington, D.C., because President Trump's name was added to it. A jazz band called The Cookers canceled their New Year's Eve show, and another musician, Chuck Redd, canceled his Christmas Eve show. The center's president, who is a friend of Trump, threatened to sue Redd. The article also mentions other news: strong winds and snow caused power outages in the Great Lakes and Northeast, and many flights were delayed. In sports, a football player named Stefon Diggs is facing charges but denies them, and his team supports him. In world news, the United Arab Emirates is pulling its soldiers out of Yemen after Saudi Arabia attacked a shipment, which might make the war in Yemen worse.",

    "The Kennedy Center is a famous place for music and shows in the United States. President Trump is a former leader of the country, and some people disagree with his actions. Artists often use their shows to share their feelings about politics. Weather like snow can cause problems like power outages and travel delays. In sports, players can face legal issues, and teams might support them. Wars in other countries, like Yemen, involve different groups fighting, and countries like Saudi Arabia and the UAE can have conflicts that affect the war."
