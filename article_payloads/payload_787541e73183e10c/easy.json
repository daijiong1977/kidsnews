  "title": "Space Telescope Finds Life's Building Blocks in a Nearby Galaxy",
  "summary": "Scientists using the James Webb Space Telescope have discovered special molecules that are like the building blocks of life. These molecules were found frozen in ice around a young star in a galaxy close to ours called the Large Magellanic Cloud. One of these molecules, acetic acid, was seen for the first time outside our Milky Way galaxy. This discovery is exciting because it shows that the ingredients for life can form in different places in space, even in environments that are not very rich in metals, similar to the early universe. It means life might have started in more places than we thought, helping us understand how life began on Earth and possibly elsewhere.",

    "The James Webb Space Telescope is a powerful tool that looks at distant objects in space. Galaxies are huge collections of stars, and the Large Magellanic Cloud is a small galaxy near ours. Molecules are tiny parts that can combine to form things like water or DNA, which are important for life. Scientists study these to learn how life began on Earth and if it could exist elsewhere in the universe."
