  "title": "Investigation into the Deaths of Hollywood Director Rob Reiner and Wife Michele",
  "summary": "Rob Reiner, a renowned Hollywood film-maker and actor, and his wife Michele were discovered dead in their Los Angeles residence. Authorities are treating the incident as an apparent homicide after emergency services responded to a call at their upscale Brentwood home on Sunday afternoon. Reiner is celebrated for directing iconic films across various genres, such as When Harry Met Sally and A Few Good Men. A family spokesperson issued a statement confirming the tragic loss and requesting privacy. Tributes have poured in from notable figures, including former President Barack Obama and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. Police reported that a 78-year-old man and 68-year-old woman were pronounced dead at the scene, but they have not officially identified the couple or disclosed details about the circumstances. No arrests have been made, and no suspects are currently being sought. The Los Angeles Fire Department received a call for medical aid, and robbery homicide detectives from the LAPD have initiated a homicide investigation. At a news conference, Deputy Chief Alan Hamilton stated that the bodies remained inside the house hours after the initial response, with the cause of death to be determined by the coroner. Reiner, son of comedy legend Carl Reiner, began his career in the 1960s and gained fame for his role in the TV sitcom All in The Family, earning two Emmy Awards.",
