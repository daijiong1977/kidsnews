  "title": "BYD Beats Tesla in Electric Car Sales Race",
  "summary": "BYD, a company from China, is about to become the world's biggest seller of electric cars, beating Tesla for the first time. In 2025, BYD sold over 2.25 million electric cars, which is a lot more than Tesla's 1.65 million. Tesla had a tough year because people were not happy with some new cars, and Elon Musk, Tesla's boss, was busy with other things like politics. BYD sells cars for lower prices than other companies, which helps it grow fast in places like Latin America and Europe, even though some countries charge extra taxes on Chinese cars. This change shows that Chinese companies are becoming very strong in making electric vehicles.",
