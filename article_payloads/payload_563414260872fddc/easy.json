  "title": "Drivers Fined by Mistake on Roads",
  "summary": "In England, many drivers got speeding fines they didn't deserve because of a problem with speed cameras. Since 2021, about 2,650 times, cameras on A roads and motorways took pictures of cars that weren't really speeding. This happened because there was a delay between the cameras and signs that change speed limits. When the speed limit went up, the camera might still think it was lower, so it fined drivers for going too fast even if they were following the new limit. National Highways, the group that runs these roads, said sorry for the mistake. They are fixing the cameras and will give money back to drivers who paid fines. Police will also take points off licenses if needed. Not all wrong camera activations led to fines, but drivers who were affected will be contacted. Safety is important, so everyone should still follow speed limits as usual.",

    "In England, there are special roads called motorways and A roads where many cars drive. To keep everyone safe, there are rules about how fast cars can go. Speed cameras are used to check if drivers are following these rules. Sometimes, machines can make mistakes, just like people do. When that happens, it's important to fix the problem and help those who were affected. This article talks about a mistake with speed cameras that led to unfair fines for some drivers."
