  "title": "BP Gets a New Boss: A Big Change at an Oil Company",
  "summary": "BP, a big oil company, has a new boss named Meg O'Neill. She is the first woman to lead a major global oil firm. The old boss, Murray Auchincloss, is leaving after less than two years. He replaced Bernard Looney, who got in trouble for not telling about relationships at work. BP is changing its plan to focus more on oil and gas instead of renewable energy like wind and solar. Some investors wanted this change because BP was not making as much money as other companies. Rivals like Shell are also doing similar things. Meg O'Neill says she wants to help BP provide energy for the world. A new chairman was also appointed recently. Experts say this is a big shake-up to make BP stronger and avoid being taken over by another company.",
