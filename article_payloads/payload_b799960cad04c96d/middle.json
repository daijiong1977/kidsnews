  "title": "Alcaraz's Serve Evolution: A Key to Grand Slam Success",
  "summary": "Carlos Alcaraz, the world number one tennis player, is making significant strides at the Australian Open by refining his serve, which he describes as an 'important weapon.' In a recent match against Tommy Paul, Alcaraz secured a straight-set victory, advancing to his 14th Grand Slam quarter-final and breaking a record previously held by Bjorn Borg and Boris Becker for the most quarter-finals before age 23. Alcaraz has been working on his serve for months, noting improvements in his serve percentage, which reached 70% in this match. He monitors this statistic after each set to track progress. The match included challenges, such as a medical emergency delay and an early break by Paul, but Alcaraz recovered to win 7-6, 6-4, 7-5. His consistent serve performance, with minimal break points faced in later sets, highlights its effectiveness. Alcaraz aims to win the Australian Open to complete a career Grand Slam, having never progressed beyond the quarter-finals in Melbourne before. He will next face Alex de Minaur, with high stakes for his tournament run and legacy in tennis.",
