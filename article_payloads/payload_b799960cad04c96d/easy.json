  "title": "Carlos Alcaraz's New Serve Helps Him Win Tennis Matches",
  "summary": "Carlos Alcaraz is a young tennis player who is doing very well at the Australian Open tournament. He has made changes to his serve, which is how he starts each point by hitting the ball. Alcaraz says his new serve is an 'important weapon' because it helps him win games without losing many points. He is happy with how much he has improved his serve and checks his serve percentage, which shows how often his serve is successful, after each set. In his match against Tommy Paul, Alcaraz won in three sets and did not face many break points, meaning his opponents couldn't win games when he was serving. He is now in the quarter-finals and wants to win the Australian Open to complete a career Grand Slam, which means winning all four major tennis tournaments. Alcaraz is only 22 years old and has already broken a record for most Grand Slam quarter-finals before turning 23.",
