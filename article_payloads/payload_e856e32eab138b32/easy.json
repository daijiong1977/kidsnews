  "title": "How Cocoa and Tea Can Help Your Heart When You Sit a Lot",
  "summary": "Scientists found that eating foods like cocoa, tea, berries, and apples might help protect your heart when you sit for long times. Sitting too much can hurt your blood vessels, which are like tiny tubes that carry blood in your body. This can lead to heart problems. In a study, men drank a cocoa drink with lots of flavanols, which are healthy parts of these foods. Those who had the high-flavanol drink had better blood vessel health after sitting. This means that even if you sit a lot, eating flavanol-rich foods could keep your heart safe. It's important to move around and eat healthy to stay strong.",

    "Sitting for a long time is common, like when watching TV or at school, but it can be bad for your heart. Blood vessels help move blood, and if they don't work well, it can cause heart attacks or strokes. Flavanols are natural substances in foods like cocoa and tea that scientists think can keep blood vessels healthy. In this study, researchers tested men to see if drinking flavanol-rich cocoa helped their blood vessels during sitting. Understanding this can help people eat better to stay healthy even when they have to sit a lot."
