  "title": "A New Gold Catalyst Breaks a Green Chemistry Record",
  "summary": "Scientists have made a big discovery in green chemistry! They created a new gold catalyst that helps turn bioethanol into acetaldehyde, a useful chemical for making things like plastics and medicines. Bioethanol comes from plants, making it a greener choice than oil. The old way to make acetaldehyde was expensive and bad for the environment. The new catalyst works better at a lower temperature of 225°C and stays stable for 80 hours. It uses gold, copper, and manganese working together to make the reaction faster and more efficient. This breakthrough could help factories produce chemicals in a cleaner, safer way, reducing pollution and costs. The research was done by a team from universities in China and the Netherlands.",

    "Green chemistry is about making chemicals in ways that don't harm the Earth. Catalysts are special materials that help reactions happen faster without being used up. Bioethanol is made from plants like corn and can replace oil in making useful chemicals. Acetaldehyde is an important chemical used in many products we use every day. Scientists are always looking for better ways to make things to help our planet."
