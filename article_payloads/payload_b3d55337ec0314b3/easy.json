  "title": "A Tennis Match Between a Man and a Woman",
  "summary": "Nick Kyrgios, a man who plays tennis, beat Aryna Sabalenka, a woman who is the best in the world at tennis, in a special match called the 'Battle of the Sexes'. This match happened in Dubai and was just for fun, not in a big tournament. People talked about why they played it. For Kyrgios, it was a chance to practice because he has been hurt and wants to come back to playing tennis. For Sabalenka, it might help more people know her name, even though she is already famous. The match was not very exciting and did not have the big action some hoped for. Some people think matches like this are not a good idea because they compare men and women unfairly, but Sabalenka says it is okay. The match made people think about what such games are for.",
