He got an email that he says was from a BBC boss, showing he got more votes than it looked like. The email also said the BBC was upset because he met a US Vice-President. The BBC says the vote is checked by an independent company to make sure it is fair, and they deny cheating. Skinner is not going to the show's final and says he wants people to know why. He says he checked the email was real, but the BBC hasn't seen it. This is a story about a disagreement over a TV show vote.",
