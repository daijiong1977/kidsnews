  "title": "New Files About a Bad Man Named Jeffrey Epstein",
  "summary": "The US government released millions of new files about Jeffrey Epstein, a man who did bad things to children. These files include emails, pictures, and videos. They show details about his time in prison and his death. The files also talk about his friend Ghislaine Maxwell, who helped him. Some emails are between Epstein and famous people, like a British royal called \"The Duke.\" They discuss having dinner at a palace. The emails do not say anyone did anything wrong. The release happened because a law said the government must share these documents. This helps people learn more about what happened.",
