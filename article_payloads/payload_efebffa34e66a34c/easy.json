  "title": "Missing Zombie Worms Worry Scientists",
  "summary": "Scientists are worried because zombie worms, which are tiny creatures that eat whale bones in the deep ocean, have disappeared. These worms help break down bones from dead whales, which gives food to other sea animals. A scientist named Fabio De Leo did an experiment for ten years by putting whale bones on the ocean floor in Canada. He used cameras to watch, but no zombie worms came. This is concerning because zombie worms are important for the ocean's health. Their absence might be due to low oxygen in the water, which could be caused by climate change. If zombie worms are gone, it could mean other animals might disappear too, making the ocean ecosystem weaker.",

    "Zombie worms, also called Osedax, are small animals that live in the deep ocean. They don't have a mouth or stomach, but they use roots to drill into whale bones and get nutrients with help from microbes. When whales die, their bodies sink and become 'whale falls,' which provide food for many deep-sea creatures. Scientists study these worms to understand how ocean ecosystems work and why some animals might be disappearing due to changes like low oxygen from climate change."
