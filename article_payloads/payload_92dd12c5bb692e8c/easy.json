  "title": "UK Car Rules: A Big Change for Petrol Cars",
  "summary": "In the UK, there is a rule that says all new cars must be electric or hybrid by 2030 to help the environment. But Kemi Badenoch, a leader in the Conservative Party, says they will stop this rule if they win the next election. She thinks the rule is not good because it might hurt car companies in the UK and help other countries like China. She wants to make cleaner cars in a way that is affordable and practical. The rule was made by a past leader, Boris Johnson, and later changed by Rishi Sunak to 2035. Labour Party wants to bring it back to 2030. The government is giving money to help people buy electric cars, but some worry about new costs. This is about balancing helping the planet and keeping jobs in the UK.",

    "In the UK, leaders make rules about cars to reduce pollution and fight climate change. A rule was made to stop selling new petrol and diesel cars by 2030, but it has been changed and debated. Political parties like the Conservatives and Labour have different ideas on how to do this while keeping jobs and helping the environment. This article talks about these plans and why they matter for the future."
