  "title": "A Big Weather and Climate Center Might Close",
  "summary": "The White House wants to close a big research center in Colorado that studies the weather and climate. This center is called the National Center for Atmospheric Research, or NCAR for short. It started in 1960 and has helped scientists learn a lot about how the climate changes and how weather works. The government says it is closing because they think the center makes people too worried about climate change. Many scientists who study weather and climate are upset about this. They say NCAR is very important because it does research that helps us understand big storms, heat waves, and other weather events. Closing it could mean we know less about the weather in the future.",

    "The National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) is a place in Colorado where scientists work together to learn about the Earth's atmosphere. They study things like hurricanes, tornadoes, and how the climate is changing. This research helps people prepare for bad weather and understand why the planet is getting warmer. The center was created in 1960 and has many smart people who share their findings with others. Some leaders in the government want to close it, but many scientists think it is very valuable for keeping us safe and informed."
