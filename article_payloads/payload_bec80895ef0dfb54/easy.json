  "title": "Young People Share Feelings About Church Donations",
  "summary": "This article tells stories from young people who joined a church called the London International Christian Church. They felt pressured to give money to the church, even when they didn't have much. For example, Jodie celebrated her birthday with church members only, not her old friends, and others lived in church houses that made them feel alone. The church says donations should be voluntary and not forced. The article explains that churches must follow rules about fundraising, like not pushing people to donate. It highlights how young students, feeling lonely at university, might be influenced by groups asking for money.",

    "This article is about young students who joined a church and felt pushed to donate money. Churches are places where people gather for religious activities, and sometimes they ask for donations to support their work. It's important for charities, including churches, to follow rules that protect people from being pressured into giving money they can't afford. Young people, especially when they are new to university and feeling lonely, might be more likely to join groups that offer friendship, but they should always feel safe and not forced to do things like give money."
