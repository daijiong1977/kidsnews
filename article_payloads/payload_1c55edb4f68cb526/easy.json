  "title": "Astronaut Says Moon Suits Are Tough to Wear",
  "summary": "A former astronaut named Kate Rubins talked about spacesuits for the Moon. She said the suits are heavy and make walking on the Moon very hard. Astronauts will wear these suits for many hours each day to do work outside. The Moon has dust and less gravity than Earth, which makes it different from the space station. NASA picked a company called Axiom to make new suits for the Artemis missions. The suits need to protect astronauts from radiation and help them move better. Rubins said walking on the Moon is like running a marathon because it is so tiring. Other astronauts have gotten hurt from wearing suits, like skin cuts or joint pain. NASA hopes to send people to the Moon by 2028, but it depends on the suits and landers being ready.",

    "Spacesuits are like special armor for astronauts in space. They keep astronauts safe from things like no air, extreme temperatures, and radiation. On the Moon, astronauts need suits that are strong and flexible because they have to walk and work in low gravity and dusty conditions. NASA's Artemis program is planning to send people back to the Moon, and good suits are very important for their health and success."
