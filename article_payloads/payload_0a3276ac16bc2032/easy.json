  "title": "Why Scotch Tape Makes a Screeching Sound",
  "summary": "Scientists have solved the mystery of why Scotch tape screeches when you peel it off quickly. They found that tiny cracks move along the tape faster than sound, creating shock waves that make the loud noise. Scotch tape was invented in 1930 by an engineer named Richard Drew to help with car painting. It became popular during the Great Depression for fixing things. Tape can also make light when peeled, a phenomenon called triboluminescence, seen in things like Wint-O-Green Life Savers. In this study, researchers used high-speed cameras and microphones to watch the cracks and listen to the sound at the same time. They discovered that the screech comes from weak shocks when the cracks reach the edge of the tape. This helps us understand everyday science better.",

    "Scotch tape is a common sticky tape invented in 1930 by Richard Drew to help with car painting without removing paint. It became very useful during the Great Depression, a hard economic time, because people used it to repair items instead of buying new ones. Scientists have long been interested in tape because it can make light when peeled, called triboluminescence, which is also seen in Wint-O-Green Life Savers candy. In this study, researchers wanted to find out why tape screeches, so they used special tools to watch and listen to the tape as it peeled, discovering that fast-moving cracks create the sound."
