  "title": "Unraveling the Science Behind Scotch Tape's Screech",
  "summary": "Researchers have uncovered the mechanism behind the screeching sound produced when peeling Scotch tape rapidly. The sound originates from micro-cracks that propagate along the adhesive at supersonic speeds, generating shock waves. This study builds on earlier findings, including the discovery of triboluminescence in tape, where light is emitted during peeling. Scotch tape, invented by 3M engineer Richard Drew in 1930 for automotive painting, gained popularity during the Great Depression for repairs. Physicists have long studied tape phenomena, such as light emission and X-ray production in vacuums. In 2010, scientists identified transverse cracks during peeling, and a 2024 study linked these to sound but lacked a mechanism. The current research by Thoroddsen et al. used synchronized high-speed imaging and sound recording to test if crack tips directly produce sound pulses. Their experiments confirmed that screeching results from weak shocks when cracks reach the tape edge, due to supersonic travel relative to air. This advances understanding of adhesive physics and everyday acoustic effects.",

    "Scotch tape, developed by Richard Drew in 1930, was initially for automotive painting to prevent paint removal. Its utility expanded during the Great Depression, as people used it for repairs amid economic hardship. Physicists have explored tape's properties, noting triboluminescence—light from peeling—since the 17th century, with examples like Wint-O-Green Life Savers. In 1953, Russian scientists reported electron emission in vacuums, later confirmed in 2008 with X-ray production. Research on tape sound began with the slip-stick mechanism, and in 2010, transverse cracks were identified. A 2024 study connected these cracks to screeching but didn't explain how. The current study by Thoroddsen et al. aimed to fill this gap by experimentally testing if crack tips generate sound pulses, using advanced imaging and audio techniques to reveal the role of supersonic cracks and weak shocks."
