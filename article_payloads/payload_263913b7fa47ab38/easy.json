  "title": "Bees and Ants Fight for Food",
  "summary": "Bumble bees are having a tough time because they are fighting with invasive Argentine ants over food like nectar. Even though bees are bigger and can win fights against ants one-on-one, these battles take up a lot of time. This means bees spend less time collecting food, which is bad for their hives. The hives are already struggling with problems like losing their homes, getting sick, and being harmed by pesticides. Scientists found that bees often stay away from places where ants are eating, to avoid fights. This research helps us understand how invasive species can hurt important pollinators like bees.",

    "Bumble bees are important insects that pollinate flowers, which helps plants make fruits and seeds. They live in groups called colonies and collect nectar for food. Invasive species, like Argentine ants, are animals that spread to new areas and can harm local wildlife. This article talks about how these ants are causing problems for bees by fighting over food, making it harder for bees to survive when they already face other dangers like pesticides and habitat destruction."
