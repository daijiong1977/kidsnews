  "title": "AI Finds a Hidden Lion Roar",
  "summary": "Scientists have discovered that African lions make two kinds of roars, not just one. Using artificial intelligence, researchers found a new 'intermediary roar' that helps identify lions better. This is important because lions are in danger, with only about 20,000 to 25,000 left in Africa. The AI system can tell the roars apart with high accuracy, making it easier for conservationists to track and protect these big cats. This new method reduces human mistakes and helps save lions from extinction. It shows how technology can help animals in the wild.",

    "Lions are big cats that live in Africa and are known for their loud roars. They are in danger because their numbers are going down. Scientists study them to help protect them. Artificial intelligence, or AI, is a smart computer tool that can learn from sounds and pictures. In this study, AI helped find a new type of roar that people didn't know about before. This makes it easier to count lions and keep them safe."
