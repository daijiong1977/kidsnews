  "title": "AI Finds a Hidden Lion Roar",
  "summary": "Scientists have discovered that African lions make two kinds of roars, not just one. Using artificial intelligence, researchers found a new 'intermediary roar' that helps identify lions better. This is important because lions are in danger, with only about 20,000 to 25,000 left in Africa. The AI system can tell the roars apart with high accuracy, making it easier for conservationists to track and protect these big cats. This new method reduces human mistakes and helps save lions from extinction. The study was done by experts from universities and wildlife groups, and it shows how technology can help animals.",

    "Lions are big cats that live in Africa and are known for their loud roars. They are in danger because their numbers are going down. Conservationists work to protect them by studying how they live. Artificial intelligence, or AI, is technology that helps computers learn from data. In this study, AI was used to analyze lion sounds, which is part of a field called bioacoustics. This helps scientists understand lions better without always needing people to watch them directly."
