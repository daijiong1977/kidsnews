  "title": "AI Finds a Hidden Lion Roar",
  "summary": "Scientists have discovered that African lions make two kinds of roars, not just one. Using artificial intelligence, researchers found a new 'intermediary roar' that helps identify lions better. This is important because lions are in danger, with only about 20,000 to 25,000 left in Africa. The AI system can tell the roars apart with high accuracy, reducing mistakes from people. This helps conservation groups track lions more easily to protect them. The study was done by experts from universities and wildlife groups, and it shows how technology can save animals. Lions use roars like signatures, so knowing both types helps count them correctly.",

    "Lions are big cats that live in Africa and are known for their loud roars. They are in danger because their numbers are going down. Scientists study them to help save them from disappearing. Roars help lions talk to each other and mark their territory. New tools like AI make it easier to understand animal sounds without human mistakes. This article talks about a discovery that could help protect lions better."
