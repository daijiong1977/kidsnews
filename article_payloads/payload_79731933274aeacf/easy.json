  "summary": "Every year, famous movie stars who are nominated for Oscars get together for a special lunch and take a big group picture called a class photo. In 2026, the photo was taken at the Beverly Hilton Hotel in Los Angeles. Stars like Timothée Chalamet, Emma Stone, and Michael B Jordan were there. This year, most stars stood up straight and didn't make funny faces, but Guillermo del Toro stood out by stretching his arms out. Jacob Elordi, who is very tall, was placed in the back row next to another tall actor, Stellan Skarsgård. Teyana Taylor wore a shiny black coat and is nominated for an award. The photo helps celebrate the actors before the Oscars ceremony.",

    "The Oscars, or Academy Awards, are a big event where movies and actors are given awards for being the best each year. Before the ceremony, all the people nominated for awards meet for a lunch and take a group photo. This photo is like a school class picture but with famous stars. It's a fun tradition to see all the nominees together and spot interesting things, like who is wearing what or who is standing where. In 2026, the photo was more serious with fewer funny poses, but it still had exciting moments to notice."
