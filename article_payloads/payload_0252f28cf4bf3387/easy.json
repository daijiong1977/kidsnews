  "title": "Trump Wants to Buy Greenland to Keep It Safe",
  "summary": "President Donald Trump says the United States should own Greenland to stop Russia and China from taking it. He thinks owning it is better than just renting it, so the U.S. can defend it properly. Greenland is a big, cold island that belongs to Denmark, but it has its own government. The people of Greenland and Denmark say they do not want to sell it and want to make their own choices. Greenland is important because it is between North America and the Arctic, which helps with watching for missiles and ships. The U.S. already has a military base there from World War Two. Trump says he likes China and Russia but does not want them near Greenland. Other countries in NATO, like Canada and European nations, support Denmark and Greenland's right to decide.",

    "Greenland is a large island in the Arctic Ocean, mostly covered in ice. It is part of Denmark but has its own government. The United States is a big country in North America, and President Trump is its leader. Russia and China are other large countries. NATO is a group of countries, including the U.S. and Denmark, that promise to help each other if attacked. Military bases are places where soldiers stay to protect areas. This article talks about a disagreement over who should control Greenland for safety reasons."
