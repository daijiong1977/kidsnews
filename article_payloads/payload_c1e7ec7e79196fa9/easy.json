  "title": "A Big Climate Research Center Might Be Split Up",
  "summary": "The Trump administration wants to break up a major climate research center called NCAR. NCAR studies the weather and climate to help us understand our planet. The head of the Office of Management and Budget, Russell Vought, says NCAR spreads 'climate alarmism' and does 'woke' activities, which are efforts to include more people in science. NCAR is in Colorado and Wyoming and gets money from the National Science Foundation. Scientists are upset because NCAR is important for research, and breaking it up could hurt our ability to learn about climate change. The government might move some of NCAR's work to other places, but it's not clear if they can do that. Courts have stopped similar actions before, but the administration keeps trying. Scientists warn that losing NCAR would damage climate science.",

    "Climate change is when Earth's weather patterns change over time, often getting warmer. Scientists study it to understand how it affects our planet and people. Research centers like NCAR help by doing experiments and sharing information. Governments sometimes make decisions about science funding, which can impact what research gets done. This article talks about a political decision that might change how climate science is studied in the U.S."
