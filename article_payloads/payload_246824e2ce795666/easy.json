  "title": "Sharks and Fish Connect the Deep Ocean",
  "summary": "Scientists found that big sharks can stay deep in the ocean for hours. This deep area, called the mesopelagic zone, is dark and full of tiny living things. But why do big sharks go there? New research shows that mid-sized fish, like the bigscale pomfret, are important. These fish live in the deep ocean and move to shallower waters at night to eat. They help connect the deep and shallow parts of the ocean. Scientists used special tags to track the fish's movements. They worked with fishermen to put tags on the fish. The study helps us understand how ocean life works together, with these fish linking big sharks to smaller creatures.",

    "The ocean has different layers, from the sunny surface to the dark deep parts. In the middle, there's a zone called the mesopelagic or twilight zone, where it's dim and many tiny organisms live. Big animals like sharks sometimes go there, but scientists wondered why. They discovered that mid-sized fish, such as the bigscale pomfret, play a key role by moving between deep and shallow waters, helping transfer energy and food. This connection is important for the ocean's food web, where creatures depend on each other for survival. Understanding this helps protect ocean life."
