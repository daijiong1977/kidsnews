  "title": "Hot Weather at Tennis Tournament in Melbourne",
  "summary": "The Australian Open tennis tournament in Melbourne, Australia, had very hot weather with temperatures reaching 42.7°C. This extreme heat made it hard for players and fans. The tournament used special things like mist tunnels, water machines, and sun umbrellas to help people cool down. Some matches, like wheelchair events, were postponed to a cooler day. Other matches on outside courts were played early in the morning to avoid the hottest part of the day. The heat scale measures factors like sun strength and humidity to decide when it's too hot to play. The Australian Bureau of Meteorology gave a heat warning for Victoria state. Players like Alfie Hewett and Andy Lapthorne were affected, with Lapthorne mentioning extra challenges for wheelchair players who can't sweat due to injuries.",
