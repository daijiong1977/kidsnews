  "title": "How Spending Money on New Players Helped Two Teams Reach the Super Bowl",
  "summary": "This article talks about how two football teams, the New England Patriots and Seattle Seahawks, spent a lot of money to sign new players during free agency, which is a time when teams can hire players from other teams. Usually, spending big in free agency doesn't lead to success in the playoffs, but this season was different. The Patriots spent the most money, over $364 million, on 19 players, including star defensive tackle Milton Williams and receiver Stefon Diggs. The Seahawks spent over $205 million, with quarterback Sam Darnold as their biggest signing. Both teams made it to the Super Bowl, showing that their aggressive spending paid off. The teams' leaders said they were careful to pick players who would fit well with the team culture and help on and off the field. This story shows how smart spending can help teams win big games.",

    "In the NFL, free agency is a period each year when players whose contracts have ended can sign with new teams. Teams use this to improve their rosters by adding experienced players. The Super Bowl is the championship game at the end of the season, and reaching it is a big achievement. This article explains how two teams used free agency spending to build successful teams and make it to the Super Bowl, which is unusual because big spending doesn't always lead to wins."
