  "title": "Rybakina's Comeback: Winning the Australian Open After Four Years",
  "summary": "Elena Rybakina, a 26-year-old tennis player from Kazakhstan, secured her second Grand Slam title by winning the Australian Open, nearly four years after her first major victory at Wimbledon. In the final, she defeated world number one Aryna Sabalenka in a thrilling three-set match (6-4, 4-6, 6-4). Rybakina's celebration was understated, with a clenched fist and head shake, reflecting her relief and disbelief. This win marks her return to top form, challenging the dominance of players like Sabalenka and Iga Swiatek, who have won multiple slams in recent years. Rybakina attributed her success to persistent hard work with her team, especially during periods of doubt. She emphasized that beating top opponents has boosted her confidence, suggesting she may now consistently perform at elite levels. The article highlights her journey from a breakthrough at Wimbledon to re-establishing herself as a contender in women's tennis.",
