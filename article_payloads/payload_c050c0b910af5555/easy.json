  "title": "NHS Gene Database Helps Find Cancer Risk",
  "summary": "The NHS in England has made a new database with 120 genes linked to cancer. This helps people and their families check if they might get cancer because of their genes. If they are at risk, they can get regular check-ups and tests for cancers like breast and prostate cancer. This can help find cancer early and give better care. The database is safe and private. It is part of a 10-year plan to prevent and treat cancer better. People who know their risk can take steps to stay healthy.",

    "Cancer is a disease where cells in the body grow too fast and can cause harm. Genes are like instructions in our bodies that we get from our parents, and some genes can make it more likely to get cancer. The NHS is a health service in England that helps people stay healthy. A database is a tool that stores information, like a big digital list. This new NHS database helps people check if their genes put them at risk for cancer, so they can get help early."
