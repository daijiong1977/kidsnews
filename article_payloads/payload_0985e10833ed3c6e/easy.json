  "summary": "Campaigners are working hard to save Ellisland Farm, a historic place in Scotland where Robert Burns wrote the famous song 'Auld Lang Syne'. They need to raise £12 million to fix the farm because it has problems like damp and decay. The farm is very old and important, and they want to make it a fun place for people to visit, with a museum and other attractions. A special film was made to show why the farm matters. The leaders of the trust, like Duncan Dornan and Joan McAlpine, believe this project will help the local economy and inspire everyone. They have already raised some money and plan to share more details next year.",
