  "title": "Preserving Robert Burns' Legacy at Ellisland Farm",
  "summary": "Campaigners are launching a major effort to save Ellisland Farm, the historic site where Robert Burns composed 'Auld Lang Syne', by raising £12 million for restoration. The farm, located north of Dumfries, has faced serious issues like damp and structural decay, threatening its future. The Robert Burns Ellisland Trust, led by chair Duncan Dornan and project director Joan McAlpine, aims to transform it into a world-class cultural destination with a museum, visitor accommodation, and a centre for song. This initiative coincides with a new film premiere to highlight the farm's significance. The trust has already secured £500,000 and plans to reveal detailed restoration plans early next year. They argue that reviving Ellisland will not only preserve Burns' heritage but also boost the local economy through tourism and sustainability. McAlpine emphasized that extensive research and consultation have shown the potential for the site to generate income and support regional regeneration, drawing on Dornan's past success with the Burrell Renaissance project.",

    "Robert Burns (1759-1796) was a renowned Scottish poet and lyricist, famous for works like 'Auld Lang Syne,' which is sung worldwide on occasions like New Year's Eve. Ellisland Farm, where he lived from 1788 to 1791, is a Category A-listed building, meaning it is of national importance in Scotland. Campaigns to preserve historic sites often involve trusts that manage funds and projects, focusing on cultural heritage and economic benefits. Understanding such efforts helps appreciate how communities protect their history while fostering tourism and local development."
