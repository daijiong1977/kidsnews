  "title": "Watching a Pulsar Twinkle in Space",
  "summary": "Scientists from the SETI Institute watched a pulsar called PSR J0332+5434 for almost a year to see how its radio signals flicker as they travel through space. Pulsars are spinning stars that send out steady radio flashes. As these signals move through clouds of gas between stars, they get scattered, causing them to twinkle and arrive at Earth at slightly different times. This twinkling is called scintillation. The team used the Allen Telescope Array to measure these changes every day for about 300 days. They found that the twinkling strength changes over days to months, with a big cycle every 200 days. Understanding this helps make pulsar timing more accurate and can aid in searching for signals from other civilizations by telling natural space signals apart from human-made ones.",

    "Pulsars are like cosmic lighthouses—they are the leftover cores of big stars that exploded long ago. As they spin, they send out beams of radio waves that we can detect on Earth. When these waves travel through space, they pass through clouds of gas and dust, which make them flicker or twinkle. Scientists use radio telescopes to study this twinkling to learn more about space and improve their search for signals from other civilizations."
