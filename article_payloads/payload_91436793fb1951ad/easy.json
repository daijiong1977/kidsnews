  "title": "Fungi Help Trees Grow in New Forests",
  "summary": "Scientists are studying tiny fungi in the soil to help create new woodlands in England. They want to plant many trees to make forests, but trees need help from fungi to grow strong. Fungi live underground and connect to tree roots, giving them water and food. In return, trees give the fungi carbon. The research is happening in Cumbria, a place with old grasslands. By checking the soil, scientists can find out which fungi are there. This helps them decide where to plant trees and which types to use, so the trees don't die. Groups like RSPB and Spun are working together on this project to make sure the new forests are healthy and last a long time.",

    "Forests are important for animals, clean air, and fun places to play. In England, people want to plant more trees to make new forests. But trees need help from tiny things called fungi in the soil. Fungi are like helpers that connect to tree roots underground. They take water and food from the soil and give it to the trees. In return, trees give fungi carbon, which is like food for them. Scientists are studying this in Cumbria to make sure the new trees grow strong and healthy, so we can have more forests in the future."
