  "title": "Revealing Roman Grandeur: The Discovery of Wales' Largest Villa and Its Implications for Heritage Studies",
  "summary": "Archaeologists have made a groundbreaking discovery in Wales, unearthing the largest Roman villa ever found in the region, situated beneath Margam Country Park. Utilizing advanced ground-penetrating radar technology, the team identified a 572-square-meter structure characterized by a corridor villa design with two wings, a veranda, and multiple rooms, indicative of a high-status residence likely occupied by a local dignitary. This find is particularly significant due to the site's pristine preservation, as the land has remained unploughed and undeveloped, offering an exceptional window into Roman civilian life in Wales, which is predominantly documented through military installations. Led by Dr. Alex Langlands of Swansea University's Centre for Heritage Research and Training, the project exemplifies interdisciplinary collaboration involving Neath Port Talbot council and Margam Abbey Church, and is embedded within a broader community archaeology initiative aimed at enhancing public engagement with heritage. The exclusive report to BBC News underscores the villa's potential to reshape historical narratives, providing unparalleled insights into agricultural estates and social hierarchies during the Roman period. This discovery not only advances academic knowledge but also highlights the efficacy of non-invasive methodologies and participatory approaches in contemporary archaeological practice.",
