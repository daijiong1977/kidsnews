  "title": "A Giant Roman House Found Under a Park in Wales",
  "summary": "Archaeologists have made an exciting discovery in Wales: a huge Roman villa found under a popular park. Using special radar, they saw the villa's shape underground without digging. The villa is very big, about 572 square meters, and has many rooms like a corridor and wings. It was likely home to an important person long ago, maybe a local leader who lived there with many people around. The land has not been farmed or built on, so the villa is well-preserved, like a time capsule. This find helps us learn more about Roman life in Wales, which is rare because most Roman sites there are military. The discovery was shared with the BBC and involves schools and the community to teach about history.",

    "This article is about a big discovery in Wales, a country in the United Kingdom. Long ago, the Romans lived there and built houses called villas. Archaeologists are people who dig up old things to learn about history. They used a tool called ground-penetrating radar to see underground without hurting the site. The villa was found in a park that people visit for fun, and it's important because it tells us about life in Roman times, which is different from the military sites usually found in Wales. The project involved local people and schools to share the excitement of history."
