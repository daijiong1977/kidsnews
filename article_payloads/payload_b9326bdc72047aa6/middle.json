  "title": "Uncovering Wales' Largest Roman Villa: A Community Archaeology Project",
  "summary": "In an unprecedented archaeological find, researchers have uncovered the largest Roman villa ever discovered in Wales, located beneath Margam Country Park. Using ground-penetrating radar, the team mapped a 572-square-meter structure with a corridor, two wings, and multiple rooms, suggesting it was a prestigious residence for a local dignitary. The site's significance lies in its excellent preservation, as the land has remained undisturbed by farming or development, offering a rare glimpse into Roman civilian life in Wales, which is typically dominated by military remains. Led by Dr. Alex Langlands from Swansea University, the project involved collaboration with Neath Port Talbot council and Margam Abbey Church, and was part of a broader initiative to engage school pupils and the local community in heritage learning. The discovery, shared exclusively with BBC News, provides unparalleled insights into Wales' national story, highlighting the villa's role as a center for a large agricultural estate. This find not only advances historical knowledge but also demonstrates the value of community involvement in archaeological research.",

    "This article discusses a major archaeological discovery in Wales, part of the United Kingdom, where Roman history is often associated with military sites like forts. The Roman villa, found under Margam Country Park, represents a civilian settlement from ancient times, offering a contrast to the typical military remains. Ground-penetrating radar is a non-invasive method used in archaeology to detect subsurface features, allowing researchers to study sites without damaging them. The involvement of schools and the community highlights the growing trend of public archaeology, which aims to make historical research accessible and educational. Dr. Alex Langlands is an expert in heritage studies, adding credibility to the findings. This discovery sheds light on Roman agricultural and social structures in Wales, enriching our understanding of the region's past."
