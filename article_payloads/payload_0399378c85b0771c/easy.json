  "title": "A New Camera for Heart Health",
  "summary": "Scientists have made a special camera called fast-RSOM that can take pictures of tiny blood vessels in your body without any needles or cuts. These tiny blood vessels are important because they can show early signs of heart problems before you feel sick. The camera uses light and sound to see inside your skin and check how well the blood vessels are working. It helps doctors find people who might get heart disease early, so they can give better treatments and help keep hearts healthy. The camera is small and easy to use, so it might be used in doctor's offices someday to check everyone's heart health.",

    "Heart disease is a common sickness that affects how your heart pumps blood. It can make you feel tired or have chest pain, but sometimes there are no signs until it's serious. Doctors use tools like stethoscopes and tests to check heart health. New inventions like fast-RSOM help find problems early by looking at tiny blood vessels under the skin, which can show if someone is at risk before they feel sick. This helps doctors give better care and keep hearts strong."
