  "title": "Mars Had an Ice Age Long Ago",
  "summary": "Scientists have found new pictures from Mars that show signs of a past ice age. The images come from a spacecraft called Mars Express and focus on an area named Coloe Fossae. This place has long grooves, valleys, and craters that were shaped by ice moving long ago. Ice ages happen when a planet gets colder naturally, not because of people. On Mars, ice spread from the poles to other areas during cold times and left marks when it melted. These clues help us learn about Mars's history and how it changed over time. It's exciting because it shows that Mars, like Earth, had big climate changes in the past.",

    "Mars is a planet in our solar system that scientists study to learn about its past. It has ice at its poles and signs that it was once colder. Ice ages are times when ice spreads across a planet, and they happen because of natural changes in how the planet moves around the sun. On Earth, we have had ice ages too, but the one on Mars ended long ago. By looking at pictures from space, researchers can see where ice used to be and how it shaped the land, helping us understand if other planets can have climates like Earth."
