  "title": "Helping Kids with Special Needs in School",
  "summary": "The government in England says it will not stop helping children with special educational needs and disabilities (SEND). The education secretary, Bridget Phillipson, promises to spend more money to support these kids. She explains that children will have their needs checked when they move to secondary school. New plans called Individual Support Plans (ISPs) will be made for every child with special needs, giving them legal rights to get help quickly. Parents worry about changes, but the minister assures them that effective support won't be taken away. The full details will be in a paper released on Monday, aiming to fix a system that isn't working well.",

    "In England, some children have special educational needs and disabilities (SEND), which means they need extra help in school. The government is planning changes to make the system better. Currently, kids might have Education, Health and Care Plans (EHCPs), which are legal documents for support. The new system will use Individual Support Plans (ISPs) to give help more quickly. Parents are concerned, but the education secretary says support won't be taken away and more money will be spent."
