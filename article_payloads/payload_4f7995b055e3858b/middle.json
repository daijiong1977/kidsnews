  "title": "Eurovision's 70th Anniversary Live Tour: A Celebration Amid Challenges",
  "summary": "The Eurovision Song Contest has announced a live tour to commemorate its 70th anniversary, starting after this year's grand final. Organized by the European Broadcasting Union (EBU), the tour will feature memorable performers from the contest's seven-decade history, including 10 entrants from this year, though the full lineup remains unconfirmed. It begins at London's O2 arena on June 15 and visits nine other European cities, aiming to bring the contest's 'scale, spectacle and spirit' to fans who missed out on tickets. However, the announcement occurs during ongoing turmoil, as some countries like Ireland and Spain have withdrawn due to disputes over Israel's participation and reforms. Artists like Thomas Neuwirth and Karolina Czarnecka have also distanced themselves from Eurovision recently. The tour format includes performers singing their own entries and covering favorite songs from Eurovision's history, with director Martin Green emphasizing its uniqueness in capturing the contest's evolution. The selection of artists for the tour will depend on their performance in this year's contest, highlighting a focus on quality and memorability.",
