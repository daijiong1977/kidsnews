    "The Brit Awards, established in 1977, are a key event in the UK music industry, honoring achievements in pop, rock, and other genres. Traditionally held in London, the move to Manchester represents a effort to decentralize cultural events and engage with northern audiences. Olivia Dean, a graduate of the Brit School, has gained attention for her soulful pop music, with her second album blending jazz elements and emotional lyrics. Her recent Grammy win enhanced her profile, making her a favorite at the Brits. The inclusion of artists like Rosalía and Rosé reflects the awards' growing emphasis on global diversity, recognizing music beyond English-language hits. This shift aligns with broader trends in the music industry towards inclusivity and cross-cultural exchange."
