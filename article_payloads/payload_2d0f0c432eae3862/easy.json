  "title": "Trump Criticizes Indiana Republicans for Saying No to Redrawing Maps",
  "summary": "In Indiana, a group of lawmakers voted against a plan to change the state's voting district maps. President Donald Trump wanted this plan to help his party win more seats in the U.S. House of Representatives in future elections. When the vote failed, Trump was upset and criticized a Republican leader named Rodric Bray. Trump said he would support someone else to run against Bray in the next election. Bray explained that many Republicans did not think changing the maps now was the best way to help their party win. This story shows how politicians sometimes disagree on how to achieve their goals.",

    "In the United States, states draw maps called voting districts to decide where people vote for their representatives in Congress. Sometimes, politicians want to change these maps to help their political party win more elections. This process is called redistricting. It can be controversial because it might give one party an advantage. In this story, President Trump and some Republicans in Indiana disagreed on whether to change the maps now or later."
