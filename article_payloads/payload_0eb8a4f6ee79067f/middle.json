  "title": "Eric Dane's Legacy in ALS Advocacy",
  "summary": "Eric Dane, known for his role in Grey's Anatomy, was diagnosed with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) in April 2025 and passed away 10 months later. ALS is a progressive motor-neurone disease that causes muscle paralysis and is currently incurable. In his final months, Dane dedicated himself to advocacy, aiming to 'move the needle' forward for ALS research and awareness. He launched a campaign to secure over $1 billion in federal funding for research and joined the board of Target ALS, helping exceed a $500,000 fundraising goal. Additionally, he used his acting skills to raise awareness by appearing on the medical drama Brilliant Minds, portraying a character with ALS to highlight the challenges of the disease. Dane emphasized the importance of sharing his journey to combat bureaucratic hurdles and improve the landscape for those affected. His efforts were recognized when Time magazine named him one of the 100 most influential people in health, underscoring his impact in pushing for advancements in ALS treatment and support.",

    "ALS, or amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, is a severe neurodegenerative disease that affects nerve cells in the brain and spinal cord, leading to loss of muscle control and eventual paralysis. It is often referred to as Lou Gehrig's disease and has no known cure, with treatments focusing on symptom management. Advocacy efforts, like those by Eric Dane, are crucial for funding research and raising public awareness. Understanding ALS involves learning about its progressive nature, the challenges patients face, and the importance of scientific advancements to improve quality of life and seek a cure."
