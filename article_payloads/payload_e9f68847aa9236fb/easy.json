  "summary": "Police are searching for Nancy Guthrie, an 84-year-old grandma who went missing from her home in Tucson, Arizona, nearly two weeks ago. They believe someone took her against her will. Officers are active near her house, with many police cars and teams working on the case. Investigators found DNA at her home that doesn't belong to her or her family, and they discovered gloves about two miles away. The FBI released a description of a suspect from a doorbell camera: a man with a backpack. They are offering a big reward for tips to help find Nancy.",
