  "title": "Intensive Police Investigation in Search for Missing Elderly Woman",
  "summary": "Police are conducting an intensive investigation near the home of Nancy Guthrie, an 84-year-old woman who disappeared from Tucson, Arizona, nearly two weeks ago. Authorities believe she was taken against her will, leading to a large-scale operation involving armed police teams, SWAT units, and forensic experts. Evidence includes DNA found at her residence that does not match her or close contacts, as well as several gloves discovered about two miles away. The FBI has released a physical description of a suspect based on doorbell camera footage, identifying a male with an average build and a specific backpack. This footage generated over 13,000 tips, prompting an increase in the reward to $100,000. The Pima County Sheriff's Department is coordinating the search, emphasizing ongoing leads and laboratory analysis of collected evidence.",
