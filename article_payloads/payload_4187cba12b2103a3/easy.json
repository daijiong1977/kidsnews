  "title": "Italy Looks into Tourist War Games in Bosnia",
  "summary": "This article talks about a serious investigation in Italy. People say that some tourists paid money to shoot at civilians during a war in Bosnia. The war happened a long time ago in a city called Sarajevo, where people were trapped and in danger. Italy is checking if these claims are true. If they are, it would be very wrong because hurting innocent people is against the law and human rights. The story helps us understand why it's important to respect others and follow rules, even in difficult times. It also shows how countries work together to find out the truth and make sure justice is done.",

    "The Bosnian War was a conflict in the 1990s in Bosnia and Herzegovina, part of the former Yugoslavia. Sarajevo, the capital, was under siege for almost four years, meaning people were trapped with little food or safety. Many civilians suffered, and international laws protect them during wars. Italy is investigating claims that tourists paid to shoot at these civilians, which is illegal and morally wrong. Understanding this helps us see why such actions are taken seriously to uphold justice and human dignity."
