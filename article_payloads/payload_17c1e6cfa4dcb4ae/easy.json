  "title": "A New Police Service to Help Local Police",
  "summary": "The home secretary in the UK has announced a new National Police Service, which some people call a 'British FBI'. This new service will take over big crimes like terrorism, fraud, and organized crime. By doing this, local police forces can focus more on everyday crimes that happen in communities, such as shoplifting and phone thefts. The home secretary says the current system is broken and needs fixing. The new service will bring together different police agencies, use new technology like facial recognition, and share resources. It aims to make sure all people feel safe, no matter where they live. This is part of bigger police reforms to improve how police work in England and Wales.",

    "In the UK, police work to keep people safe from crimes. There are local police for towns and national agencies for big crimes. Sometimes, local police get too busy with big cases and can't handle small crimes well. The home secretary is a government official who oversees police. Reforms are changes to make things better. This article talks about creating a new national service to help local police focus on community issues."
