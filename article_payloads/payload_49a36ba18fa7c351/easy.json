  "title": "Young Tennis Star Surprises Champions",
  "summary": "In a big tennis tournament in Doha, Qatar, a 19-year-old Canadian player named Victoria Mboko surprised everyone by beating Elena Rybakina, who just won the Australian Open. Mboko was losing in the third set but came back to win. This win could help her become one of the top 10 players in the world for the first time. In another match, Maria Sakkari, who is not seeded, beat the top player Iga Swiatek. Sakkari was happy because she hasn't had a big win in a while. Both winners will play in the semi-finals against other players. The tournament shows that young and lower-ranked players can beat the best.",
