  "title": "Upsets at Qatar Open: Mboko and Sakkari Defeat Top Seeds",
  "summary": "At the Qatar Open in Doha, significant upsets occurred in the quarter-finals as Canadian teenager Victoria Mboko defeated Australian Open champion Elena Rybakina, and unseeded Maria Sakkari triumphed over world number two Iga Swiatek. Mboko, aged 19 and previously ranked outside the top 300, staged a comeback from 2-4 down in the third set to win 7-5, 4-6, 6-4, potentially entering the WTA top 10 for the first time. She attributed her success to playing her 'A' game against higher-profile opponents. Meanwhile, Sakkari, who has fallen to world number 52, overcame a nervous start to beat Swiatek 2-6, 6-4, 7-5, expressing relief after a period of self-doubt. Both winners advance to the semi-finals, with Mboko facing Jelena Ostapenko and Sakkari meeting Karolina Muchova, highlighting the unpredictability and competitive nature of professional tennis.",
