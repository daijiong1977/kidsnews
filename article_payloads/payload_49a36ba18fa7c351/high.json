  "title": "Strategic Upsets and Psychological Dynamics at the Qatar Open",
  "summary": "The Qatar Open quarter-finals in Doha witnessed two notable upsets, underscoring the volatile nature of professional tennis. Canadian teenager Victoria Mboko, initially ranked outside the top 300, defeated Australian Open champion Elena Rybakina 7-5, 4-6, 6-4, demonstrating tactical resilience by rallying from a 2-4 deficit in the decider. This victory positions Mboko to potentially break into the WTA top 10, marking a rapid ascent in her career. Concurrently, unseeded Maria Sakkari, whose ranking has plummeted to 52, overcame top seed Iga Swiatek 2-6, 6-4, 7-5, articulating the psychological struggle of self-doubt after a prolonged winless streak. Both matches highlight the intersection of skill, mental fortitude, and competitive unpredictability. Mboko advances to face Jelena Ostapenko, while Sakkari meets Karolina Muchova in the semi-finals, with implications for ranking dynamics and tournament narratives in the WTA circuit.",
