  "title": "Trump Changes a Big Rule About Air Pollution",
  "summary": "The Environmental Protection Agency, or EPA, is a government group that makes rules to keep our air clean. In 2009, the EPA said that greenhouse gases, which come from cars and factories, are dangerous because they make the Earth warmer and cause more storms and dirty air. This rule was called the Endangerment Finding, and it helped the government create laws to reduce pollution. But now, President Trump and the EPA have decided to get rid of this rule. They say it was a scam and not based on good science. Some people worry this change could lead to more health problems like asthma and early deaths. The EPA leader, Lee Zeldin, thinks removing the rule will save money and give people more choices. This is a big change in how America deals with climate change.",

    "The EPA is a part of the U.S. government that works to protect nature and people from pollution. Greenhouse gases, like carbon dioxide, come from burning fuels and can make the planet warmer, leading to problems like bad weather and sickness. In 2009, under President Obama, the EPA made a rule called the Endangerment Finding to say these gases are harmful, so they could make laws to reduce them. Now, under President Trump, the EPA has taken away this rule, which changes how America handles climate issues. Some experts think this might hurt people's health, while others believe it helps the economy."
