  "title": "What Happens When People Stop Weight Loss Shots?",
  "summary": "Weight loss shots, called GLP-1s, help people lose weight by making them feel less hungry. Tanya Hall tried these shots and lost a lot of weight. But when she stopped taking them, she felt very hungry again, like a switch turned on. These shots are new, and doctors are still learning about their long-term effects. Many people in the UK pay for them privately, which can be expensive. Tanya had side effects like feeling sick and losing hair while using the shots. She wonders if she can keep the weight off without the shots. The article shares stories of people trying to stop and what happens to their bodies.",

    "Weight loss shots are medicines that help people who struggle with hunger. They work by copying a hormone in the body that tells the brain when to stop eating. These shots are popular because they can help people lose weight when diets don't work. But they are new, so scientists don't know all the effects of using them for a long time. Some people have side effects like feeling sick or losing hair. The article talks about what happens when people try to stop taking the shots and if they can keep the weight off."
