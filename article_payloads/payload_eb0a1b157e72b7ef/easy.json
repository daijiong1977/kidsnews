  "title": "Food Preservatives and Cancer Risk",
  "summary": "A big study from France found that eating more food preservatives might slightly increase the chance of getting cancer. Preservatives are chemicals added to packaged foods to make them last longer on shelves. The study looked at over 100,000 people for about 7.5 years and tracked what they ate and if they got sick. While most preservatives did not show a link to cancer, a few specific ones might be risky. The researchers say we need more studies to be sure, but this makes us think about whether the rules for food safety should change to protect people better. Preservatives are common in processed foods like snacks and drinks, so it's important to understand their effects.",

    "Food preservatives are substances added to foods like chips, soda, and canned goods to prevent them from going bad. They help food stay safe to eat for a longer time, which is useful for storing and selling. However, some scientists worry that these chemicals could harm our health. Cancer is a disease where cells in the body grow too much and can make people very sick. Studies like this one help us learn if everyday things we eat might affect our health, so we can make better choices and have safer food rules."
