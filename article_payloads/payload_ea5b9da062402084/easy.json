  "title": "Election Plans Change: Councils Work Hard to Get Ready",
  "summary": "The government changed its mind about delaying some local elections in England. At first, they wanted to put off votes in 30 areas until 2027 to save money, but after a legal challenge, they decided to hold the elections in May as planned. This sudden change means councils and election workers have less time to prepare, making it very hard for them to be ready. People who run elections say they lost months of planning time and now face a tough job to catch up. Elections will happen in places like Norfolk, Suffolk, and others on May 7. The government said their legal advice changed, but they haven't explained why, and some people want them to share more details.",
