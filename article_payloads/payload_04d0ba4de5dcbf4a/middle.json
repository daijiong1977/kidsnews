  "title": "Tragic Death of Nigerian Singer After Snake Bite Incident",
  "summary": "Ifunanya Nwangene, a 26-year-old aspiring singer from Nigeria, died on Saturday following a snake bite in her apartment in Abuja. She gained recognition after appearing on The Voice Nigeria in 2021, known for blending genres like jazz, opera, and soul. According to friends, she was asleep when bitten by a cobra, and two snakes were later discovered in her home. Initially, she sought treatment at a nearby clinic, but it lacked antivenom, prompting a move to a hospital. Her friend Sam Ezugwu reported that the hospital had one type of antivenom but not another, and despite efforts to stabilize her, she struggled to breathe and died. The hospital, Federal Medical Centre Jabi, denied claims of inadequate response, stating they provided immediate care including antivenom and resuscitation, but her condition deteriorated due to severe complications. This incident has sparked grief in the community, highlighting issues with healthcare access and snake safety in urban areas.",
