  "title": "UK's First Geothermal Plant Powers Homes with Earth's Heat",
  "summary": "The UK has launched its first geothermal power plant in Cornwall, marking a significant milestone in renewable energy. After nearly two decades of development, Geothermal Engineering Ltd drilled the deepest on-shore well in the UK, reaching three miles underground where temperatures hit nearly 200°C. This heat super-heats water, which drives turbines to generate electricity for approximately 10,000 homes. Additionally, the plant produces lithium, a critical mineral for green technologies like electric vehicle batteries. Unlike intermittent sources such as wind and solar, geothermal provides continuous, 'always-on' power, enhancing energy security. However, the project cost £50 million, funded by private investors and the EU, and high drilling costs pose challenges for replication. Experts from the British Geological Survey praise it as a major step forward but note financial hurdles. The electricity is sold to Octopus Energy for distribution via the national grid, supporting clean, domestic energy production.",

    "Geothermal energy harnesses heat from the Earth's interior, typically by drilling into hot rock formations. In the UK, shallow geothermal systems like ground source heat pumps are already used for heating, but deep geothermal for electricity generation is new. This technology involves circulating water through fractured granite to absorb heat, which then drives turbines. Lithium, extracted as a byproduct, is essential for batteries in electric vehicles and renewable storage. The high costs and technical challenges of deep drilling have limited geothermal adoption, but this project demonstrates its potential for providing stable, clean energy. Understanding these aspects helps assess the role of geothermal in transitioning to sustainable energy systems."
