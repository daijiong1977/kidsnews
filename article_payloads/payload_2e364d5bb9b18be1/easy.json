  "summary": "In the UK, a new power plant has started using hot water from deep underground to make electricity. This is called geothermal energy. The plant drilled three miles down where it is very hot, nearly 200 degrees Celsius. The hot water turns turbines to create electricity for 10,000 homes. It also gets lithium, a mineral used in batteries for things like electric cars. This is the first time the UK has done this, and it took many years and a lot of money to build. Unlike wind or solar power, geothermal works all the time, day and night. People are excited because it helps make clean energy without pollution.",

    "Geothermal energy comes from the Earth's heat deep underground. In some places, people use shallow heat for warming homes, but this new plant goes much deeper to make electricity. It is a renewable source, meaning it won't run out like oil or gas. This helps reduce pollution and fight climate change. The UK is trying new ways to get energy without harming the environment."
