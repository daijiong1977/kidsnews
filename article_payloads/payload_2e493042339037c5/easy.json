  "title": "Earthquake Faults Can Heal Themselves",
  "summary": "Scientists have found that deep earthquake faults can fix themselves quickly after moving. This happens in slow slip events, which are like very slow earthquakes where the ground moves a little over days or weeks. Researchers studied the Cascadia Subduction Zone, where one plate slides under another. They did experiments with quartz under high pressure and heat to see how faults heal. This discovery helps us understand earthquakes better and could make predictions more accurate. It shows that faults can get strong again fast, which is important for safety.",

    "Earthquakes happen when the Earth's plates move and cause shaking. Faults are cracks where this movement occurs. Scientists study faults to understand how to predict earthquakes and keep people safe. This article talks about new research showing that deep faults can heal quickly, which might change how we think about earthquakes."
