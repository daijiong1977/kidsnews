  "title": "Tennis Player's Premature Celebration Leads to Loss in Australian Open Qualifying",
  "summary": "In a dramatic turn of events at the Australian Open qualifying rounds, Austrian tennis player Sebastian Ofner experienced a costly error during his match against American Nishesh Basavareddy. Ofner, who has previously reached the fourth round at the French Open, believed he had secured victory when leading 7-1 in a third-set tie-break. He celebrated by raising his arms and approaching the net, but he misunderstood the rules: final-set tie-breaks require 10 points to win. After the umpire informed him of his mistake, Basavareddy capitalized on the situation, winning eight of the next nine points to clinch the match 4-6, 6-4, 7-6 (13-11). Basavareddy attributed his comeback to persistence and noted Ofner's tension, while also mentioning the challenging conditions with old balls. This victory advances Basavareddy to the final qualifying round, where he will face Britain's George Loffhagen. The article also highlights other results, such as Arthur Fery's win over Bernard Tomic and Harriet Dart's loss, providing context on the competitive nature of tennis qualifiers. The Australian Open main draw begins soon, featuring players like Cameron Norrie and Emma Raducanu.",
