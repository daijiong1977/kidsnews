  "title": "Tennis Player Celebrates Too Soon and Loses Match",
  "summary": "Sebastian Ofner, a tennis player from Austria, made a big mistake in a match to qualify for the Australian Open. He thought he won when he was ahead 7-1 in a tie-break, so he celebrated by raising his arms and walking to the net. But the rules say you need 10 points to win in the final set tie-break. He still needed three more points. When the umpire told him, he realized his error. His opponent, Nishesh Basavareddy from America, then won eight of the next nine points to win the match. Basavareddy celebrated by holding his hands to his neck and roaring. He said he kept believing because in a tie-break, you always have a chance. Basavareddy will now play another match to try to get into the main tournament. Other players like George Loffhagen and Arthur Fery also won their matches, but Harriet Dart lost. The Australian Open starts soon.",
