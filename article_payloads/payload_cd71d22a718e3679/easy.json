  "title": "A New Kind of Magnet for Smarter Computers",
  "summary": "Scientists have discovered a new type of magnet called altermagnetism in a material called ruthenium dioxide. This is exciting because it could help make computers faster and store more information. Magnets are used in memory devices to save data, but current ones have problems like being easily disturbed by other magnets or hard to read. Altermagnets might fix these issues by being stable and easy to read with electricity. The researchers made very thin films of this material and tested them to prove they have altermagnetism. They used special tools to see how the tiny magnetic spins inside work. This discovery could lead to better memory for phones and computers, making them quicker and more efficient. The team plans to build new devices using this material and find other altermagnets too.",

    "Magnets are materials that can attract certain metals like iron. They are used in many things around us, such as fridge magnets, speakers, and computer memory. In computers, magnets help store information so you can save files and apps. There are different types of magnets: some are strong but get messed up by other magnets, while others are stable but hard to read. Scientists are always looking for new magnets to make electronics better. This article talks about a new kind called altermagnetism, which might combine the best features to improve how computers work."
