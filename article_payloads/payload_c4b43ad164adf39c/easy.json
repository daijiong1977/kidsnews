  "title": "Author Colleen Hoover Shares Her Cancer Journey",
  "summary": "Colleen Hoover, a famous author who writes books like It Ends With Us, has told everyone she had cancer. She is 46 years old and from the United States. She shared this news on Instagram and Facebook. Colleen had surgery to remove the cancer, and it was successful. She also had radiotherapy treatment, which is almost done. She kept her cancer private at first because she wanted to wait until she knew she was okay. Colleen missed some important events, like a movie premiere, because she was sick. She thinks her cancer might be related to not exercising enough, eating unhealthy food, and feeling stressed. Even though she hates vegetables and exercise, she is happy to be alive. Her new book, Woman Down, just came out this week.",
