  "title": "Colleen Hoover's Cancer Diagnosis and Public Disclosure",
  "summary": "Colleen Hoover, the best-selling author of novels such as It Ends With Us and Reminders of Him, has publicly disclosed her cancer diagnosis and treatment journey. The 46-year-old American writer shared the news via Instagram and Facebook posts this week, revealing that she underwent successful surgery and is nearly finished with radiotherapy. Hoover explained that she initially kept her diagnosis private, only informing fans after confirming the surgery's success and determining her treatment plan. She delayed seeking medical advice until after the film adaptation of Reminders of Him was completed in Canada, prioritizing her work over health concerns. Upon returning home, she received the cancer diagnosis, which caused her to miss significant events like the Regretting You premiere. Hoover has not specified the type of cancer but suggested possible links to environmental and lifestyle factors, including lack of exercise, poor diet, and stress. Despite her humorous complaints about healthy habits, she expressed gratitude for being alive. Her latest novel, Woman Down, was released concurrently with this announcement, highlighting her continued professional activity amidst personal challenges.",
