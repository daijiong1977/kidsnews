  "title": "A New Vaccine to Stop Fentanyl Overdoses",
  "summary": "Fentanyl is a very strong drug that can make people stop breathing and die, even in tiny amounts. A company called ARMR Sciences is making a vaccine to protect people from fentanyl. This vaccine works like a bulletproof vest for the body. It teaches the immune system to make special fighters called antibodies that grab onto fentanyl in the blood. This stops the drug from going to the brain, so people don't get high or overdose. The vaccine has been tested in rats and worked well, blocking most of the fentanyl. Now, ARMR Sciences is starting a trial with people in the Netherlands to see if it is safe and works for humans. If it works, it could save many lives because fentanyl causes many overdose deaths, especially in young adults.",

    "Fentanyl is a synthetic opioid drug that is very powerful and can be deadly even in tiny amounts. It is often mixed with other street drugs without people knowing, leading to many overdose deaths, especially among young adults. Overdoses happen when too much drug affects the brain and stops breathing. Naloxone is a medicine that can reverse overdoses, but it must be given quickly after someone overdoses. Vaccines are shots that help the body fight diseases or harmful substances by training the immune system. ARMR Sciences is developing a new vaccine to prevent fentanyl overdoses by stopping the drug from reaching the brain, which could save lives and change how we deal with drug problems."
