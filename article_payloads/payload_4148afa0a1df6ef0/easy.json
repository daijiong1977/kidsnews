  "summary": "Meagan Good and Jonathan Majors are famous actors from the United States. They traveled to Guinea, a country in West Africa, and became citizens there. They found out through DNA tests that their ancestors came from Guinea. This means they now have passports from Guinea and can feel connected to their heritage. At a special ceremony, they received their passports and watched traditional dances and music. The ceremony was organized by Guinea's government to welcome people of African descent back to their roots. The actors are visiting places in Guinea, like Boké, which has historical sites. Other celebrities have also become citizens of African countries to reconnect with their ancestry.",
