  "title": "Who Decides Greenland's Future?",
  "summary": "A UK government official, Lisa Nandy, says that Greenland's future should be decided by its own people, not by other countries. The US President, Donald Trump, wants to take over Greenland and has threatened to put taxes on goods from the UK and other European countries if they don't agree. Nandy thinks this is not helpful and wants to have a calm discussion with the US. She says the UK will not change its mind that Greenland's people should choose what happens. Other leaders, like Sir Keir Starmer, also disagree with the US plan. The US says Greenland is important for security but some US officials prefer talking instead of using force. Nandy hopes to talk with Trump soon to solve this problem.",

    "Greenland is a large island near the Arctic that is part of Denmark but governs itself. Countries sometimes argue over land because it can have resources or be important for safety. Tariffs are taxes that countries put on imports to pressure others. Leaders like Lisa Nandy work to protect their country's interests while trying to solve problems through talk instead of fights."
