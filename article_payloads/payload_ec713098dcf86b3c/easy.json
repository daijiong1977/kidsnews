  "title": "Happy Moments Make Couples Stronger",
  "summary": "Couples who take time to enjoy happy moments together have better relationships. Researchers at the University of Illinois studied this by asking 589 adults in the United States about their relationships. They found that when couples focus on positive experiences, like fun times or good memories, they feel happier together, argue less, and believe their relationship will last longer. This is called \"joint savoring,\" which means sharing and appreciating good things as a team. The study showed that this helps especially when couples are stressed, making them feel more confident and healthy. It's a simple way for couples to stay close and strong.",
