  "title": "A Blood Test Difference Can Warn About Kidney Problems",
  "summary": "Doctors use blood tests to check how well kidneys work. Two common tests measure creatinine and cystatin C. A new study found that when these tests give very different results, it can be an early warning sign. People with big differences are more likely to have kidney failure, heart disease, or even die. The study looked at over 860,000 adults from different countries and followed them for 11 years. Researchers say using both tests together gives a better picture of kidney health than using just one. This helps doctors find problems earlier, so patients can get treatment sooner and avoid serious issues like dialysis. Kidney disease is a big problem worldwide, so better testing is important.",

    "Kidneys are organs in your body that filter waste from blood to keep you healthy. Doctors use blood tests to check if kidneys are working well. Creatinine and cystatin C are two markers in blood that help with this. Sometimes, these tests give different results, which can mean there is a hidden health issue. Kidney disease affects many people around the world and can lead to serious problems if not caught early. This study shows how comparing two tests can help doctors spot risks sooner and improve care."
