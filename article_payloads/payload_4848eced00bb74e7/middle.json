  "background_read": [
    "Euphoria is an HBO drama that premiered in 2019, gaining attention for its raw portrayal of teenage life, including themes like substance abuse, sexuality, and mental health. The show features a diverse cast led by Zendaya, who won an Emmy for her role as Rue, a teenager battling addiction. Season 2 ended with cliffhangers, leaving fans eager for resolution. The production of Season 3 faced significant challenges: Hollywood writers' and actors' strikes in 2023 delayed filming, and the untimely death of Angus Cloud, who played the beloved character Fezco, added emotional and logistical hurdles. Sam Levinson, the creator, has a mixed reputation due to his other show, The Idol, which was poorly received. This context shapes expectations for Season 3, as viewers wonder how the show will handle Cloud's absence and whether it can maintain its impact while evolving the characters into adulthood."
