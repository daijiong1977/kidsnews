  "title": "A Smart Trick to Make Quantum Computers Work Better",
  "summary": "Quantum computers are super-fast machines that could help solve big problems, but they make mistakes easily. These mistakes are called errors, like when a qubit (the basic part of a quantum computer) flips from 0 to 1 or changes its phase. To fix this, scientists combine many qubits into one logical qubit and use error correction to keep information safe. A team led by Professor Andreas Wallraff found a new way to do calculations on these logical qubits while fixing errors at the same time. This is important because it helps quantum computers run without being stopped by mistakes. They used a method called surface codes, where information is spread across many qubits and checked with stabilizers to find and correct errors. This brings us closer to practical quantum computers that can do amazing things.",

    "Quantum computers are advanced machines that use qubits instead of regular bits. They can solve complex problems faster, but they often make errors due to decoherence. Scientists work on error correction methods like combining qubits and using surface codes to fix these mistakes. This helps make quantum computers more reliable for future uses in science and technology."
