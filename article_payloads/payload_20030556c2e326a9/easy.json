  "title": "A Boxer's Wish to Say Sorry",
  "summary": "This story is about Prince Naseem Hamed, a famous boxer, and his trainer Brendan Ingle. They worked together for 18 years, starting when Naseem was just seven years old in Sheffield. Brendan helped Naseem become a world champion boxer. But later, they had a big fight over money and a book that made them angry. They stopped talking and never made up. Naseem tried many times to say sorry and be friends again, but Brendan did not want to meet. When Brendan died in 2018, Naseem felt very sad because he never got to hug him or say goodbye. A new movie called Giant shows their story, and in the film, there is a happy ending where they hug, but in real life, that never happened. Naseem wishes it did.",
