  "title": "Putin's Control Over Russia's Billionaires During the Ukraine War",
  "summary": "This article examines how President Vladimir Putin has maintained the support of Russia's billionaires, known as oligarchs, during the war with Ukraine. Despite Western sanctions aimed at turning the wealthy against Putin, the number of billionaires in Russia has reached an all-time high, yet their political influence has drastically declined. Putin employs a carrot-and-stick approach: offering rewards for loyalty and imposing harsh penalties for dissent. A key example is Oleg Tinkov, a former banking billionaire who criticized the war; he was forced to sell his bank, Tinkoff Bank, for only 3% of its value after Kremlin pressure, resulting in a massive financial loss. Historically, oligarchs like Boris Berezovsky wielded significant power and even claimed to have helped Putin rise to the presidency, but over time, Putin consolidated control, leading to their diminished role. By the time of the full-scale invasion in 2022, oligarchs could not object to Putin's decisions, even as their fortunes were threatened. The article highlights that sanctions have failed, and oligarchs have become silent backers, reinforcing Putin's authority during the conflict.",

  "background_read": [
    "Russia's political landscape has evolved significantly since the Soviet Union's collapse in 1991. During the 1990s, a group of wealthy individuals, known as oligarchs, emerged by acquiring state-owned assets and gaining substantial influence. Vladimir Putin became president in 2000 and gradually centralized power, reducing oligarchs' political clout. The war with Ukraine, which began in 2014 and escalated in 2022, led to Western sanctions targeting Russia's economy and elites. Despite these measures, Putin has maintained control through a mix of coercion and incentives, ensuring oligarchs' compliance. This context helps explain why oligarchs, though financially thriving, remain voiceless in political matters, highlighting the complexities of power dynamics in modern Russia."
