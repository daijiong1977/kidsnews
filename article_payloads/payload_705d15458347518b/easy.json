  "title": "How Russia's Rich Stay Quiet During the War",
  "summary": "This article talks about rich people in Russia, called oligarchs, and how they have changed under President Vladimir Putin. During the war with Ukraine, the number of billionaires in Russia is at a record high, but these wealthy people have lost almost all their political power. Putin uses a mix of rewards and punishments to keep them on his side. For example, when a banker named Oleg Tinkov criticized the war, he was forced to sell his bank for a very low price and lost a lot of money. In the past, oligarchs had more influence and helped Putin come to power, but now they cannot object to his decisions. The article shows that Western sanctions have not made the rich oppose Putin, and they have become silent supporters during the war.",

Now, during the war with Ukraine, they have to support Putin even if they don't want to, because he uses rewards and punishments to control them. This helps Putin stay strong in the war."
