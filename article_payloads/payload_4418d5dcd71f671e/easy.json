  "title": "Eye Ointment Danger for Glaucoma Patients",
  "summary": "Scientists in Japan found that a common eye ointment can damage a tiny device used to treat glaucoma, a serious eye disease. The device, called a MicroShunt, helps drain fluid from the eye to reduce pressure and prevent vision loss. It is made from a special plastic that can absorb oil from petrolatum-based ointments, causing the device to swell and sometimes break. The researchers studied real patients and did lab tests to show this problem. They warn doctors and patients to avoid using these ointments with the MicroShunt to keep it safe and working properly. Glaucoma affects millions of people worldwide, and this discovery helps protect their eyesight.",

    "Glaucoma is a common eye problem where pressure builds up inside the eye, damaging the optic nerve and leading to vision loss. It affects about 76 million people around the world. Doctors use treatments like the MicroShunt, a small implant, to help drain fluid and reduce pressure. This device is safer than some older surgeries, but new research shows it can be harmed by certain eye ointments. Understanding this helps patients and doctors make better choices to protect eyesight."
