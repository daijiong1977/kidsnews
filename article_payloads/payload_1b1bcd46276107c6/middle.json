  "title": "Milos Raonic Retires After a Notable Tennis Career",
  "summary": "Milos Raonic, a former Wimbledon finalist and Canadian tennis star, has announced his retirement at age 35. Known for his powerful serve, dubbed 'Missile', Raonic reached a career-high world ranking of three in 2016, the same year he advanced to the Wimbledon final but lost to Andy Murray. Throughout his career, he won eight tour-level titles and made it to four Masters 1000 finals, though he lost all of them to top players like Novak Djokovic and Rafael Nadal. Raonic expressed gratitude, stating he was the 'luckiest person' to fulfill his dreams since starting tennis at age eight. His last match was at the 2024 Olympics, where he exited in the first round. Born in Yugoslavia and raised in Canada, he now looks forward to applying his dedication to new endeavors, emphasizing continued motivation and effort.",
