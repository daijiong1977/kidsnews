  "title": "Catherine Zeta-Jones Explores Art Collecting and Its Connection to Her Film Role",
  "summary": "Catherine Zeta-Jones, a well-known actor, has recently taken up art collecting as a personal hobby, which aligns with her latest film role in The Gallerist, where she portrays an art consultant. She owns works by notable artists such as sculptor Henry Moore and contemporary artist Marc Quinn, indicating her growing interest in the art world. Living in New York with her husband Michael Douglas, she notes that her social circle includes more art enthusiasts compared to Los Angeles, reflecting her immersion in the city's vibrant art scene. For their shared birthday, Douglas gifted her a piece by Marc Quinn, whose sculptures have sold for high prices, like Myth Venus. Zeta-Jones describes herself as an eclectic collector, frequently purchasing artworks from flea markets and during travels as mementos. This hobby contrasts with the darker themes of The Gallerist, a comedy-thriller about art fraud, highlighting how her real-life passion is more about appreciation and personal connection to art.",
