  "title": "Catherine Zeta-Jones Starts Art Collecting for Fun",
  "summary": "Catherine Zeta-Jones is a famous actor who has started collecting art as a hobby. She likes to buy sculptures and paintings, especially from artists like Henry Moore and Marc Quinn. This hobby is similar to her new movie role where she plays an art consultant. She lives in New York with her husband Michael Douglas and enjoys spending time with art people there. For her birthday, Michael bought her a piece by Marc Quinn, which is very expensive. Catherine also buys small artworks when she travels to remember her trips. Her movie, The Gallerist, is a funny thriller about selling art, but her real-life interest is more about enjoying and collecting beautiful things.",
