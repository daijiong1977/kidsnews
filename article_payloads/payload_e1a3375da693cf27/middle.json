  "summary": "Hollywood actress Margot Robbie has expressed strong admiration for the BBC sitcom Gavin & Stacey, calling it the best show ever. In an interview on the Table Manners podcast, she discussed her love for the comedy, which centers on family and friendship dynamics after two characters from different towns meet. Robbie highlighted the series finale, where Smithy proposes to Nessa, as particularly enjoyable, noting she watched it twice. She also shared her enthusiasm with entertainment legend Bette Midler during a dinner, leading to Midler starting to watch the show. The finale aired on Christmas Day 2024, attracting nearly 12 million live viewers and over 20 million total watches, making it a record-breaking event. Meanwhile, Robbie is promoting a new film adaptation of Wuthering Heights, but took time to praise the sitcom's impact. Additionally, the real-life house used as Uncle Bryn's home in Barry is now for sale, and Welsh comedian Rob Brydon sent Robbie a birthday message in character after learning she is a fan. The article shows how celebrity endorsements can boost a show's popularity and connect fans across generations.",
