  "title": "Unveiling a Massive Rotating Cosmic Filament of Galaxies",
  "summary": "An international research team led by the University of Oxford has discovered one of the largest rotating structures in the universe: a thin line of 14 gas-rich galaxies embedded within a cosmic filament located approximately 140 million light years from Earth. Cosmic filaments are immense thread-like networks of galaxies and dark matter that form the cosmic web, acting as pathways for matter and angular momentum. This particular filament, about 50 million light years long, contains over 280 galaxies, with the 14 galaxies in the thin strand spinning in the same direction and the entire filament rotating as a single structure. The rotation speed is estimated at 110 km/s, and the filament is in a 'dynamically cold' state, indicating it is young and undisturbed. This discovery challenges existing models by suggesting that large-scale cosmic structures significantly influence galaxy rotation over long periods. Researchers used data from the MeerKAT radio telescope to identify hydrogen-rich galaxies, which serve as tracers for gas flow and help understand how angular momentum shapes galaxy evolution. The findings may refine models for future weak lensing surveys and provide insights into early galaxy formation.",

    "The universe is structured by a cosmic web, with cosmic filaments as its largest components, made of galaxies and dark matter. These filaments facilitate the flow of matter and angular momentum, influencing galaxy formation and rotation. Galaxies often contain hydrogen gas, key for star formation, and their spin can be affected by larger structures. Astronomical tools like radio telescopes detect radio emissions from hydrogen to map these processes. Research in this field helps understand galaxy evolution and tests cosmological models, with implications for upcoming missions like the Euclid spacecraft and Vera C. Rubin Observatory."
