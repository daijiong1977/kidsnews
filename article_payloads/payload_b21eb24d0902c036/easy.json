  "title": "A Giant Spinning Space Chain of Galaxies",
  "summary": "Scientists have found one of the biggest spinning things in space! It is a long, thin line of 14 galaxies that are rich in gas, located about 140 million light years away from Earth. This line is part of a huge cosmic filament, which is like a giant thread in space made of galaxies and dark matter. The galaxies in this thin line are spinning in the same direction, and the whole filament itself is also spinning, like a big ride at a park. This helps us learn how galaxies get their spin from the larger structures around them. The discovery was made using powerful telescopes and might teach us more about how galaxies form stars and grow over time.",

    "Space is full of amazing structures like galaxies, which are huge groups of stars. Scientists study these to understand how the universe works. Galaxies often form in long threads called cosmic filaments, which are part of a cosmic web. Spinning is common in space, and this discovery helps explain how galaxies start spinning from these larger threads. Telescopes like MeerKAT help scientists see faraway objects by collecting radio waves from space."
