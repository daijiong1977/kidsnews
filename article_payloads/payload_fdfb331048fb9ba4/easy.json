  "title": "A Man Helping Young People Find Jobs",
  "summary": "Alan Milburn is a man who used to be a government minister. He is working to help young people who are not in school, work, or training, called Neets. There are almost a million young people aged 16 to 24 in this group, which is the highest number in over 10 years. More than half of them are not looking for work. Milburn says this is a big problem, especially in the north-east of England where it is hard to find jobs. He calls it a catastrophe because it affects society, the economy, and politics. Milburn grew up in a poor area and had a tough school, so he understands the challenges. He supports a local youth project called Patchwork, where a youth worker named Karl says the term Neet is negative and blames people unfairly. They want to find better solutions to help young people get opportunities.",
