  "title": "Scientists Make a Tiny Light Trap for Better Sensors",
  "summary": "Scientists at CU Boulder have created a tiny device called a microresonator that traps light on a chip. This device is like a small loop where light goes around and gets stronger. By making the light stronger, it can help build better sensors for things like navigation or finding chemicals. The team used a special shape called a racetrack with smooth curves, which helps keep more light inside instead of letting it escape. They built this device in a very clean room using a machine that writes with electrons to make it super small and precise. This work means future sensors could use less power and work better.",

    "Scientists are always looking for ways to make technology smaller and better. Light is used in many devices, like sensors that help cars navigate or detect chemicals. By trapping light in a tiny chip, they can make these sensors work more efficiently with less energy. This is important for creating new tools that are powerful and save power."
