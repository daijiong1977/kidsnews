  "title": "Advancing Optical Microresonators for Enhanced Sensor Technology",
  "summary": "Researchers at CU Boulder have developed highly efficient optical microresonators, which are microscopic structures that confine light to increase its intensity on a chip. This innovation aims to support next-generation sensor technologies, such as those for navigation and chemical identification, by enabling specialized optical processes with reduced power consumption. The team focused on racetrack resonators, incorporating Euler curves to minimize bending loss—this design allows light to travel through gradual curves, preventing escape and enhancing photon circulation. Fabrication occurred at the COSINC clean room using electron beam lithography, which offers sub-nanometer precision critical for reliable device performance. By limiting light loss, the microresonators achieve higher intensities necessary for optimal operation, paving the way for more powerful and energy-efficient sensors in various applications.",
