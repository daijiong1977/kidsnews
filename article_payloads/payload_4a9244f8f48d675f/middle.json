  "title": "Tennis Player's Quick Response to Ball Girl's Collapse at Australian Open",
  "summary": "During a first-round match at the Australian Open, a ball girl collapsed near the umpire's chair in the second set. Zeynep Sonmez, a Turkish tennis player ranked 112th in the world, immediately rushed to assist her. The ball girl had fainted and was shaking, so Sonmez helped her walk to the side of the court where medical staff provided attention in the shade. After a six-minute delay, the girl recovered and was helped off court, and play resumed. Sonmez emphasized the importance of being a good human being over being a good tennis player, stating it was her instinct to help. She later won the match against Ekaterina Alexandrova in three sets, completing an upset. The incident highlights sportsmanship and quick action in emergencies at major sporting events, with Tennis Australia confirming the girl received on-site care before going home.",
