  "title": "Why Bees Get a New Queen",
  "summary": "In honey bee colonies, sometimes the queen bee gets sick and can't lay enough eggs. When this happens, the worker bees notice and decide to raise a new queen to take over. This process is called supersedure. Scientists found that viruses can make the queen's ovaries shrink, so she lays fewer eggs. She also makes less of a special smell called methyl oleate, which tells the workers she is healthy. When the smell decreases, the workers start preparing a new queen. Bees are important because they help pollinate many crops we eat, like fruits and vegetables. If the queen is replaced, it can cause problems for the hive and for beekeepers who rely on bees for honey and pollination. Researchers think adding the missing smell might help keep hives stable.",

    "Bees live in groups called colonies with a queen, workers, and drones. The queen is the mother of all bees in the hive and lays eggs. Worker bees are females that do jobs like collecting food and caring for the young. Pollination happens when bees fly from flower to flower, helping plants grow fruits and vegetables that people eat. Beekeepers manage hives to get honey and help with farming. Sometimes, the queen gets old or sick, and the workers make a new one to keep the colony strong. This article talks about how viruses can make queens weak and how scientists are finding ways to help."
