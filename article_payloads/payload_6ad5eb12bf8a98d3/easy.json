  "title": "Why Bees Get a New Queen",
  "summary": "In a honey bee colony, the queen bee is the leader who lays eggs. Sometimes, the workers bees decide to replace her in a process called supersedure. This happens when the queen gets sick from viruses, which make her lay fewer eggs and produce less of a special smell called methyl oleate. The worker bees notice this change and start raising a new queen. This is important because bees help pollinate many of the foods we eat, like fruits and vegetables. If the queen is replaced, it can cause problems for the hive and for farmers who rely on bees. Scientists found that adding the missing smell back can help keep the hive stable. This research helps beekeepers take better care of their bees.",

    "Bees live in groups called colonies with one queen who lays eggs. Worker bees do jobs like collecting food and caring for the hive. Pollination is when bees carry pollen from flower to flower, helping plants grow fruits and vegetables we eat. Viruses are tiny germs that can make animals sick, and in bees, they can affect the queen's health. Beekeepers are people who take care of bee hives to get honey and help with farming."
