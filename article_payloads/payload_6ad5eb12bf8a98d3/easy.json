  "title": "Why Bees Get a New Queen",
  "summary": "In a honey bee colony, sometimes the queen bee gets sick and can't lay enough eggs. When this happens, the worker bees notice and decide to raise a new queen to take over. This process is called supersedure. Scientists found that viruses can make the queen's ovaries shrink, so she lays fewer eggs and makes less of a special smell called methyl oleate. This smell tells the workers she is healthy. Without it, they start to replace her. Bees are important because they help pollinate many of the foods we eat, like fruits and vegetables. If the queen is replaced, it can cause problems for the hive and for farmers who rely on bees. Beekeepers might use a fake version of the smell to help keep the queen in charge and the hive strong.",

    "Bees live in groups called colonies, with one queen who lays eggs and many workers who gather food and care for the hive. Pollination is when bees move pollen from one flower to another, helping plants grow fruits and vegetables that people eat. Viruses are tiny organisms that can cause sickness in animals and insects. Beekeepers manage hives to produce honey and help with farming. This article explains how bees decide to change their queen when she gets sick from viruses, which affects food production."
