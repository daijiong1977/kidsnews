  "title": "President Trump Wants the Military to Use Coal Power",
  "summary": "President Trump has made a new rule that tells the military to buy electricity from coal power plants. Coal is a type of fuel that makes electricity, but it is very dirty and expensive compared to other sources like wind, solar, and gas. It creates a lot of pollution that can harm people's health and the environment. Before this, the U.S. was using less coal because it is not good for the planet. Trump says coal is clean and reliable, but experts disagree. This rule might force the military to sign long contracts to buy coal power, even after Trump is no longer president. The goal is to help coal plants stay open by making the government buy their electricity, even though it costs more and pollutes more.",

    "Coal is a fossil fuel that has been used for many years to generate electricity, but it releases harmful substances like carbon dioxide and particulates into the air, contributing to climate change and health issues. In recent times, countries have been shifting to cleaner energy sources like wind and solar to reduce pollution. The military is a large user of energy, and decisions about its power sources can impact the environment and costs. Understanding how government rules affect energy choices helps us see the balance between supporting industries and protecting the planet."
