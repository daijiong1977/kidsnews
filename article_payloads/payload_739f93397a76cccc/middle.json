  "title": "Trump's Executive Order to Boost Coal Through Military Contracts",
  "summary": "President Trump has issued an executive order directing the military to procure electricity from coal-fired power plants through long-term contracts, aiming to artificially sustain the coal industry. Coal is the most polluting and second most expensive energy source in the U.S., surpassed only by nuclear in cost and emitting high levels of carbon dioxide, particulates, and toxic substances. Prior to Trump's return to office, the U.S. energy grid had been transitioning away from coal due to environmental and economic concerns. The administration justifies this move by claiming coal is clean, reliable, and cost-effective, but these assertions contradict factual data showing coal's higher expenses and environmental harm. This order represents a shift from free-market principles to government intervention, following earlier attempts to declare an energy emergency to keep coal plants open. Critics argue that the justification is spurious, citing examples like Texas grid failures where coal plants underperformed. The long-term contracts could bind the military beyond Trump's term, impacting energy policy and environmental goals. This action highlights tensions between industrial support and sustainable energy transitions in U.S. policy.",

  "background_read": [
    "Coal has been a dominant energy source in the U.S. for decades, but its decline accelerated due to environmental regulations, competition from cheaper natural gas and renewables, and public health concerns. The Trump administration has consistently promoted fossil fuels, arguing for energy independence and job preservation, while critics emphasize climate change risks and economic inefficiencies. Executive orders are powerful tools for presidents to enact policy without congressional approval, often sparking legal challenges. The military, as a major energy consumer, influences market trends, and its procurement decisions can shape energy infrastructure. Understanding this context helps analyze the implications of mandating coal use, including potential long-term environmental and economic impacts, and the debate over government's role in energy markets."
