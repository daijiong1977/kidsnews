  "title": "Love Island Show Delayed by Wildfires",
  "summary": "A TV show called Love Island: All Stars has been postponed because of wildfires. The show is filmed in South Africa, and the villa where they film had to be evacuated to keep everyone safe. ITV, the company that makes the show, said health and safety is the most important thing, so they delayed the premiere. Wildfires are big fires that spread quickly in nature, and authorities in South Africa are working to control them. The show is a dating program where former contestants try to find love. Hosted by Maya Jama, it has 12 contestants, including two past winners. This delay means fans will have to wait longer to watch the new episodes.",
