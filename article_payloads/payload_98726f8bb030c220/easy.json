  "title": "Why Women Earn Less Than Men: A 30-Year Wait for Fair Pay",
  "summary": "A union report says it will take until 2056 for women to earn the same as men if things don't change faster. Right now, women earn about 12.8% less than men on average, which means they work for free for 47 days each year. This gap is biggest in jobs like finance and insurance, where women earn 27.2% less, but smaller in leisure services at 1.5%. Even in jobs where most workers are women, like teaching and healthcare, there is still a pay gap. The union wants better flexible work and childcare to help close the gap. Employers with over 250 staff must share their pay data and soon make plans to reduce the gap. Some people worry that making changes could cost businesses money.",

    "The gender pay gap is a long-standing issue where women earn less than men for similar jobs. This happens for many reasons, like women taking time off for childcare or facing bias at work. Unions are groups that fight for workers' rights, and they use reports to show the problem and ask for changes like flexible hours and better childcare support. In the UK, big companies must share their pay information to make things fairer, but some businesses worry about costs. Understanding this helps us see why fairness in pay is important for everyone."
