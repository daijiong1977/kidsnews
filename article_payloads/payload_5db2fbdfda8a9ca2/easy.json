  "title": "Katie Boulter's Tough Choice: Body or Tennis Ranking",
  "summary": "Katie Boulter is a tennis player from Britain who has a big decision to make. Her world ranking has dropped from 23rd to 100th, and she is worried about getting into the Australian Open, a major tennis tournament. She has a hip injury and must decide if she should play in more tournaments to improve her ranking or rest her body to heal. If she plays, she might get hurt worse, but if she rests, other players could pass her in the rankings. This is hard because the entry for the Australian Open depends on rankings in December. Men players do not have this problem because their rankings are set earlier, so they can rest. Boulter thinks it is important to take breaks to avoid burnout and stay healthy.",

    "Tennis is a sport where players hit a ball over a net. Professional players have rankings that show how good they are. Grand Slams are the biggest tournaments, like the Australian Open. Injuries can stop players from competing, and they need to balance health with their career. The WTA is for women's tennis, and rankings help decide who gets to play in events."
