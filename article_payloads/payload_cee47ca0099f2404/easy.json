  "title": "Eurostar Trains Back on Track After Tunnel Trouble",
  "summary": "Eurostar and Le Shuttle trains between the UK and France are running again after a big problem in the Channel Tunnel. On Tuesday, many trains were cancelled because of a power issue and a broken train that blocked the tracks. This caused long delays for thousands of passengers, especially those traveling for New Year's Eve. Repair workers fixed the problems overnight, so services started again on Wednesday morning. Eurostar says most trains are now running, but there might still be some delays or last-minute cancellations. Passengers should check the Eurostar website for updates before they travel. The company apologized and is offering refunds and vouchers to affected customers. Le Shuttle services are also mostly back to normal, with shorter delays in Calais.",
