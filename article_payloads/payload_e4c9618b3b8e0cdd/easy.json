  "title": "A Science Leader's Big Idea After COVID",
  "summary": "A science leader named Jay Bhattacharya from the National Institutes of Health (NIH) spoke at an event hosted by the MAHA Institute. He is still upset about how COVID-19 was handled and wants to start a 'second scientific revolution' to change science. At the event, people talked about pandemic mistakes, health system problems, and losing trust in science. Some ideas were good, but others were strange, like questions about vaccines causing cancer. Bhattacharya believes science should be more open to everyone, not just experts. The event was not like a normal science meeting because it had unusual topics and some reporters were not allowed in. This shows that Bhattacharya is trying to make big changes in science, but it might be confusing because he mixes his anger about COVID with new ideas.",

    "The National Institutes of Health (NIH) is a big government group in the US that gives money to scientists to study health and diseases. COVID-19 was a serious sickness that started in 2019 and affected people all over the world, leading to lockdowns, masks, and vaccines. Some people, like those in the MAHA Institute, have ideas about health that are not always based on science, and they hosted an event where NIH leaders spoke. Jay Bhattacharya, the head of NIH, talked about being angry about how COVID was handled and wanting to make big changes in science to involve more regular people, which he calls a 'second scientific revolution.' This event showed that science can be confusing when mixed with politics and strong feelings."
