  "title": "Regional Music Trends in UK Cities for 2025",
  "summary": "This article analyzes music listening habits across major UK cities in 2025, using data from Spotify and YouTube to reveal regional preferences and surprises. It highlights how Oasis, despite being from Manchester, has immense popularity in Scotland, indicating a north-south divide in their appeal. Sam Fender dominates in his hometown of Newcastle, breaking the usual dominance of global stars like Taylor Swift and Drake on Spotify. On YouTube, Eminem leads in most cities, with KPop Demon Hunters and Ed Sheeran also ranking high. The article uncovers unexpected trends, such as Lady Gaga's strong presence in Belfast, where she is the second most popular artist on YouTube, and Chris Brown's dedicated fanbase in Birmingham, where he appears in the top 10 on Spotify. Additionally, local artists like Billy Gillies in Belfast and D-Block Europe in Birmingham show how hometown pride influences music consumption. The data suggests that while international artists are widely loved, regional identities and local connections play a significant role in shaping music tastes, with cities often favoring artists from their own areas or showing unique preferences that differ from national trends.",
