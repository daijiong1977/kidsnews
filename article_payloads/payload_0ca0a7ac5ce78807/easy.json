  "summary": "In New Zealand, heavy rain caused landslides that hurt people and places. Two people died, and some are missing, including a young girl. The landslides happened at Welcome Bay and a campground on Mount Maunganui, which is a popular spot for camping. Rescue workers are searching through rubble with dogs to find people, but it's hard because it's dangerous. The rain made flooding and power outages too. People are very sad, and the prime minister said it's a tragedy. Tourists and hikers saw the landslides and heard people screaming for help. A state of emergency was declared to keep everyone safe.",
