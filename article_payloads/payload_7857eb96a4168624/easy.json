  "title": "Government Mistake with Royal Papers",
  "summary": "The Cabinet Office, a part of the UK government, made a mistake by accidentally sharing some old papers about Prince Andrew, who is a member of the royal family. These papers were from 2004 and 2005 and talked about his travels as a trade envoy, where he visited countries like China and Spain. They were supposed to be sent to the National Archives, a place that keeps important records, but were briefly shown to journalists before being taken back. The government said it was an 'administrative error' and that the papers were never meant to be public. Some people who want to change the monarchy think the papers should be released so everyone can see them, but the government disagrees. The papers also included other topics, like decisions about Zimbabwe and a birthday message to the Queen Mother that had a mistake.",
