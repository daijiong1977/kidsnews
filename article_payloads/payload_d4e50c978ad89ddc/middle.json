  "title": "A Lifelong Friendship Born from a Christmas Invitation",
  "summary": "In December 1975, Rob Parsons and his wife Dianne, a young couple in Cardiff, UK, experienced a life-changing moment when Ronnie Lockwood, an autistic man, knocked on their door with a frozen chicken and his possessions. Rob vaguely remembered Ronnie from childhood Sunday School and felt compelled to invite him in, despite initial plans for a short stay. Ronnie, who had been homeless since age 15, was welcomed into their home for Christmas, where they cooked his chicken, allowed him to bathe, and gave him gifts. Moved by his emotional reaction to receiving presents—something he had never experienced—the couple decided not to send him away after the holiday. They sought advice from authorities and ultimately let Ronnie stay, leading to a unique companionship that lasted 45 years until his death. This story highlights themes of compassion, the impact of small acts of kindness, and the challenges and rewards of supporting someone with autism, illustrating how a spontaneous decision can forge deep, lifelong bonds.",
