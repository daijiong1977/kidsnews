  "title": "A Kind Family and Their Longtime Friend",
  "summary": "A long time ago, a young couple named Rob and Dianne in Cardiff, UK, did something very kind at Christmas. In 1975, a man named Ronnie knocked on their door with a frozen chicken and a bag of his things. Rob remembered Ronnie from when he was a boy and invited him inside. Ronnie was autistic, which means he thought and acted differently, and he had no home. The couple let Ronnie stay for Christmas, cooked his chicken, and gave him gifts. They planned to let him stay just a few days, but they couldn't send him away. Ronnie ended up living with them for 45 years, until he passed away. This story shows how a simple act of kindness can lead to a lifelong friendship filled with love and care.",
