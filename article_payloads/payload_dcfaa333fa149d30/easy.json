  "title": "Matt Van Epps Wins Election in Tennessee",
  "summary": "Matt Van Epps, a Republican from Tennessee, won a special election to become a member of the U.S. House of Representatives. He beat his opponent, Aftyn Behn, who is a Democrat. This election was important because it happened in a district that usually votes for Republicans. President Donald Trump helped Van Epps by speaking at rallies and having a group spend money on his campaign. The district was changed in 2022 to make it harder for Democrats to win. Van Epps is a military veteran and used to work for the state government. Republicans are happy because they kept control of this seat, while Democrats hoped to win to show they can compete in more places. The election results show that Republicans still have strong support in some areas.",
