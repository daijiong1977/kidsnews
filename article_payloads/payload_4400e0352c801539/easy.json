  "title": "Ancient City Found in Kazakhstan",
  "summary": "Archaeologists have discovered an old city called Semiyarka in Kazakhstan. It was built 3,500 years ago during the Bronze Age. People lived there in houses made on mounds of earth, and they made a lot of bronze tools and objects. The city was very big, covering 140 hectares, and had a special building that might have been used for meetings or ceremonies. It was found using spy photos from space and modern tools like drones. This is surprising because most people in that area were nomads who moved around, but this city had permanent homes. Scientists think it was a busy place where traders and metalworkers lived together.",

    "Long ago, during the Bronze Age, people started using bronze metal to make tools and weapons. In some parts of the world, like Kazakhstan, many people were nomads who traveled with their animals. But sometimes, they built cities to live in permanently. Archaeologists are scientists who dig up old places to learn how people lived. They use tools like cameras on drones and satellites to find hidden cities. This helps us understand history better."
