  "title": "Ancient City Found in Kazakhstan",
  "summary": "Archaeologists have discovered an old city called Semiyarka in Kazakhstan. It was built 3,500 years ago during the Bronze Age. The city was very big, with houses, a large building, and workshops where people made bronze tools and objects. It was found using spy photos from space and modern tools like drones. Most people back then were nomads who moved around, but this city had permanent homes. The city was in a good spot near a river, which helped with trade and control. This discovery shows that ancient people on the steppe were more advanced than we thought.",

    "The Bronze Age was a period in history when people learned to make bronze from copper and tin. This happened in many parts of the world around 5,000 to 3,000 years ago. Cities started to form as people settled down to farm, trade, and make things. Nomads were groups who traveled with animals and did not have fixed homes. Archaeologists use tools like drones and radar to find old sites without digging everything up. This helps them learn about how ancient people lived and worked together."
