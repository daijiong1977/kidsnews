  "title": "Finding Hidden Minerals in U.S. Mines",
  "summary": "In the United States, mines are digging up important minerals that are needed for things like batteries and electronics, but they are not using all of them. A study by Elizabeth Holley and her team shows that these minerals, called critical minerals, are often thrown away as waste when mining for metals like copper or gold. If mines could save even a little bit of these minerals, it could help the U.S. get more of what it needs without buying from other countries. Critical minerals are special because they are important for the economy and safety, and they are used in electric cars, wind turbines, and phones. The researchers looked at data from mines to see how much of these minerals is already being mined but lost. By recovering them, it could make money, keep supplies safe, and help the environment by reducing waste. However, it is hard to do because it needs new technology and money to work well.",

    "Critical minerals are special materials that the U.S. needs for things like electric cars and phones, but often buys from other countries. Mines in the U.S. dig up metals like copper and gold, and critical minerals come along with them but are thrown away as waste. A study found that if mines saved these minerals, it could help the U.S. have more of its own supplies, make money, and protect the environment. This is important because it keeps the country safe and helps with clean energy."
