  "title": "Space Rocket Pollution: A Fireball in the Sky",
  "summary": "In February 2025, a SpaceX rocket failed and turned into a fireball over Europe. Scientists found that this rocket released lithium, a metal, into the air high above Earth. They measured more lithium than usual, which could pollute the atmosphere. The rocket was made of aluminium-lithium, and when it burned up, it sent these metals into the sky. This pollution might harm the ozone layer and affect the climate. Scientists worry that as more rockets launch, this problem could get worse. They are studying the long-term effects to understand how it impacts our planet.",

    "SpaceX is a company that builds rockets to go into space. Sometimes rockets fail and break apart in the sky. Pollution from rockets can add metals like lithium to the air, which might hurt the environment. Scientists use tools like lasers to measure pollution in the atmosphere to keep Earth safe."
