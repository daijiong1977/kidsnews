    "Mark Wolf is a federal judge who was appointed by President Reagan. He has served for 40 years, making important decisions in court. Recently, he decided to resign because he is very concerned about Donald Trump, a former president. Judge Wolf wrote an essay saying that Trump is uniquely dangerous and that the White House is harming the rule of law. The rule of law means that laws apply to everyone, including leaders, to ensure justice. Judge Wolf believes it is his duty to speak out against this to protect democracy. This story helps us understand why it is important for people in power to stand up for what is right."
