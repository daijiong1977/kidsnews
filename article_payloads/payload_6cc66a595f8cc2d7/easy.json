  "title": "Why Tennis Players Can't Wear Fitness Trackers in Big Matches",
  "summary": "In tennis, players like Carlos Alcaraz, Jannik Sinner, and Aryna Sabalenka were told to take off their fitness trackers during the Australian Open, a big tournament. Fitness trackers are small devices that help athletes check their health, like how much they sleep or how fast their heart beats. The ATP and WTA, which are groups that manage tennis tours, allow players to use these trackers in other matches. But at Grand Slam tournaments like the Australian Open, they are not allowed right now. The Australian Open is talking about maybe allowing them in the future. Some people think players should be able to use trackers to learn about their bodies, but others worry about fairness. This shows how rules in tennis can be different in various events.",
