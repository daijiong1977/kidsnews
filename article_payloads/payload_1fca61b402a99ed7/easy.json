  "title": "Ukraine's President Offers a Deal for Peace",
  "summary": "Ukraine's president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, has suggested a new idea to help end the war with Russia. He wants to make a part of eastern Ukraine, called Donetsk, a special area where there are no soldiers and businesses can trade freely. This is a compromise because Russia wants Ukraine to give up this land. The war has been going on for four years, and this proposal might help in peace talks led by the United States. However, Russia has not said if it will agree to this plan. Zelenskyy shared this idea with journalists in Kyiv, and it is part of a bigger peace plan with 20 points. The goal is to stop the fighting and find a way for Ukraine to keep its independence while making peace.",
