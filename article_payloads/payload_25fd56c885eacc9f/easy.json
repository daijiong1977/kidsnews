  "summary": "The White House has announced a new group called the 'Board of Peace' to help Gaza become stable. This group will be led by US President Trump and includes important people like former UK Prime Minister Tony Blair, US Secretary of State Marco Rubio, and US Special Envoy Steve Witkoff. They will work together to oversee Gaza's temporary governance and reconstruction after the war. Each member will have a specific job to do, but it is not yet known who will do what. Right now, no women or Palestinians are in this top group, but more members might be added later. The goal is to end the suffering in Gaza and bring peace.",
