  "title": "Composer Says No to Kennedy Center Over Name Change",
  "summary": "Stephen Schwartz, who wrote the music for the musical Wicked, has decided not to perform at the Kennedy Center. This is because the center's board voted to include President Donald Trump's name in its name. Schwartz says that performing there now feels like making a political statement, and he wants the center to be a place for all artists without politics. The Kennedy Center's president, Richard Grenell, says that Schwartz was never officially signed to perform and calls the reports false. Other artists have also canceled their shows at the center recently. The Kennedy Center is a big cultural place in Washington, D.C., and this disagreement shows how politics can affect the arts.",
