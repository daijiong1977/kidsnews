  "title": "A Special Soybean Helps Dairy Farms Save Money",
  "summary": "On a dairy farm in Michigan, a family is growing a special type of soybean that helps them save a lot of money. These soybeans are part of a project with Michigan State University. When the cows eat these soybeans, their milk gets better with more fat and protein. This makes the milk more valuable. The farm also spends less money on buying extra food for the cows. The soybeans are called high-oleic soybeans, and they have a healthy fat. The farm roasted the soybeans to make them even better. This discovery is exciting because it helps dairy farms be more successful and save thousands of dollars each month.",

    "Dairy farming is when people raise cows to get milk. Milk has fat and protein that make it healthy. Farmers often buy extra food called supplements to feed their cows, which can be expensive. Soybeans are plants that can be used as food for animals. High-oleic soybeans have a special type of fat that is good for cows. Roasting is a way to cook food to improve it. This story shows how new ideas from science can help farmers save money and produce better milk."
