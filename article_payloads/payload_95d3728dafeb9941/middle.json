  "title": "Elon Musk Reflects on His Government Efficiency Role",
  "summary": "In a recent interview on the \"Katie Miller Podcast,\" Elon Musk, the billionaire CEO of Tesla and SpaceX, discussed his tenure leading the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) under President Donald Trump. Musk described the experience as only \"somewhat successful,\" citing the immense challenges of reforming the federal government quickly. He admitted that his businesses suffered due to the time and effort spent on DOGE, which lacked popularity and faced public criticism, such as protests against Tesla. Musk stated he would not repeat the role, preferring to dedicate his energy to his companies. Despite this, he defended DOGE's achievements, claiming it saved billions by eliminating \"zombie payments\" through better automation. The interview, conducted by Katie Miller—a former DOGE spokeswoman now working for Musk—covered various topics, but did not delve deeply into DOGE's controversial methods. Since leaving the government, Musk's fortunes have improved, with Tesla shareholders approving a lucrative pay package. This reflection highlights the tensions between public service and private enterprise.",
