  "title": "Elon Musk Talks About His Government Job",
  "summary": "Elon Musk is a famous billionaire who runs companies like Tesla and SpaceX. He once worked for the government in a group called DOGE, which tried to make the government work better and save money. In a recent interview with his friend Katie Miller, Musk said that his time at DOGE was only \"somewhat successful.\" He explained that it was very hard to change the government quickly, and his own companies suffered because he was busy with DOGE. Musk also said he would not do the job again because he would rather focus on his businesses. Since leaving the government, things have improved for Musk, like getting a big pay package from Tesla. The interview covered many topics, but Musk still thinks DOGE did some good by saving money on payments.",
