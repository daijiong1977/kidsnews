  "title": "Doctors Get Extra Money for Weight Loss Medicine",
  "summary": "In England, doctors called GPs will get a bonus of about £3,000 each year if they give weight loss drugs to patients. The government wants to help people lose weight and stay healthy. The bonus starts in April and is for a drug named Mounjaro. GPs can also get extra money for sending patients to weight loss programs. But some experts say this might not help many people because the drug is only for those who are very overweight with a BMI over 40 and have health problems. Most people using weight loss drugs pay for them privately, not through the NHS. The Health Secretary says these drugs can change lives and should be available to everyone who needs them, not just those who can pay. This is the first time weight loss drugs are part of the bonus system for doctors.",

    "In England, doctors called GPs help people stay healthy. Sometimes, the government gives them extra money to do specific things, like giving vaccines or medicines. Weight loss drugs are new medicines that can help people who are very overweight. The NHS is the health system that provides free care, but some people pay privately for drugs. BMI is a way to measure if someone's weight is healthy. This article talks about a new plan to encourage doctors to use weight loss drugs more."
