  "title": "The Bayeux Tapestry's Big Trip to London",
  "summary": "The Bayeux Tapestry is a very old and long embroidery that shows the Battle of Hastings in 1066. It is coming to the British Museum in London from France next year for a special visit. The UK government will use a special insurance plan to protect it while it travels and is on display, so it doesn't cost too much money. Some people in France worry that the tapestry is too delicate to move, but French officials say it's okay. The tapestry will be in London from September next year until July 2027 while its home museum in France is being fixed. In return, the British Museum will send some old treasures to France. This helps museums share important history without spending a lot on insurance.",

    "The Bayeux Tapestry is a famous embroidery from the 11th century that tells the story of the Battle of Hastings, when William the Conqueror became king of England. It is very old and fragile, so moving it requires careful planning. Museums often share important items through loans to let more people see them, and governments sometimes help with insurance to make it affordable. This helps people learn about history and culture from different countries."
