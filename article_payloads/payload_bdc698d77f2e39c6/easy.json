  "title": "Why the Ancient Indus Valley Civilization Faded Away",
  "summary": "Scientists have discovered that long droughts caused the Indus Valley Civilization to slowly fade away. This ancient society lived near the India-Pakistan border about 5,000 to 3,500 years ago and was very advanced, with big cities and good water systems. Researchers studied old climate data from caves and lakes to learn about the weather back then. They found that temperatures rose a little and rain decreased by 10 to 20 percent. There were four big droughts, each lasting over 85 years, which made water scarce. People moved closer to the Indus River to find water, and one drought lasting 113 years matched when cities started shrinking. The civilization did not end suddenly but declined slowly due to these repeated dry periods, showing how climate can affect ancient societies.",

    "The Indus Valley Civilization was an ancient society that existed about 5,000 to 3,500 years ago in what is now Pakistan and northwest India. It was one of the earliest urban cultures, with well-planned cities and advanced water management. Scientists have long wondered why it declined, and new research suggests that long droughts played a key role. By studying old climate clues from caves and lakes, researchers found that reduced rainfall and temperature increases led to water shortages, causing people to move and cities to shrink slowly over centuries."
