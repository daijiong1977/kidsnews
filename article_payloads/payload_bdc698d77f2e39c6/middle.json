  "title": "Climate Change and the Decline of the Indus Valley Civilization",
  "summary": "A recent study published in Communications Earth & Environment reveals that prolonged droughts were a key factor in the gradual decline of the Indus Valley Civilization (IVC). This ancient urban culture, which thrived from 5,000 to 3,500 years ago in present-day Pakistan and northwest India, was known for its sophisticated cities and water management. Researchers, led by Vimal Mishra, used climate modeling and indirect environmental indicators such as stalactite and stalagmite chemical signatures from Indian caves and lake water level records to reconstruct past conditions. Their analysis showed a temperature increase of about 0.5 degrees Celsius and a 10 to 20 percent reduction in rainfall between 5,000 and 3,000 years ago. They identified four major drought periods, each lasting over 85 years and affecting up to 91 percent of the IVC area, leading to water scarcity. Settlement patterns shifted as populations moved closer to the Indus River for reliable water sources. One drought lasting 113 years coincided with archaeological evidence of deurbanization. The study concludes that the IVC did not collapse suddenly but experienced a slow, uneven decline driven by repeated environmental stresses, highlighting how long-term climate pressures can impact early civilizations.",

    "The Indus Valley Civilization (IVC) was one of the world's earliest urban cultures, flourishing from around 5,000 to 3,500 years ago in the Indus River region of present-day Pakistan and northwest India. It is renowned for its advanced urban planning, including grid-like cities, drainage systems, and water management. Despite its achievements, the reasons for its decline have been debated among scholars, with theories ranging from climate change to social factors. Recent scientific advances, such as climate modeling and analysis of geological records, have provided new insights. This study builds on previous research by integrating multiple data sources to argue that prolonged droughts were a significant driver of the IVC's slow decline, offering a nuanced view of how environmental stresses interact with human societies over long periods."
