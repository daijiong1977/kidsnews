  "title": "U.S. and Iran Talk About Nuclear Weapons in Switzerland",
  "summary": "In Geneva, Switzerland, the United States and Iran had talks to try to limit Iran's nuclear program. A U.S. official said they made progress in about three hours of talks, but they did not meet directly; instead, they used mediators from Oman. Iran's foreign minister said they now have a clearer picture of what to do, but more work is needed because both sides still have different positions. At the same time, Iran closed the Strait of Hormuz for military exercises, which is important because about 20% of the world's oil passes through there. The U.S. has sent more ships to the Middle East, including an aircraft carrier. The talks in Geneva also included discussions about ending Russia's war in Ukraine.",
