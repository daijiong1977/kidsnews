  "title": "Cannabis Stores and Health Problems",
  "summary": "This article talks about a study that looked at how living near cannabis stores can affect people's health. Researchers found that in neighborhoods with many cannabis stores close together, more people went to the emergency room because of cannabis-related issues. The study used data from over 6 million people in Ontario, Canada, from 2017 to 2022. They compared areas with stores within 1000 meters to those farther away. Results showed that areas with stores had a 12% higher rate of emergency visits. The authors suggest that limiting the number of stores or spreading them out could help keep people healthier. This research was published in a medical journal and highlights the importance of store placement for public safety.",

    "Cannabis is a plant that can be used for medicine or recreation, but it can also cause health issues if not used safely. In some places, it has been made legal, which means stores can sell it. Emergency departments in hospitals help people with serious health problems. This study looked at how having many cannabis stores in one area might lead to more health emergencies, especially in poorer neighborhoods. Understanding this can help communities make better rules to protect people's health."
