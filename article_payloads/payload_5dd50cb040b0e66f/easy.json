  "title": "Royal Family Worries About Bad News",
  "summary": "Prince William and Princess Catherine are very worried about new stories about a man named Jeffrey Epstein. They said they care about the people who were hurt by him. This is the first time they have talked about this problem in public. They made this statement because more news came out about Prince Andrew, who is related to them and was friends with Epstein. William is about to go on an important trip to Saudi Arabia, and he wants people to know he is paying attention to the bad news. The Royal Family has been quiet about Andrew before, but now they are speaking up to show they care. They hope this will help people focus on William's trip instead of just the bad stories.",

    "The Royal Family includes kings, queens, princes, and princesses who often make public statements. Jeffrey Epstein was a man who hurt many people, and his story is in the news. Prince Andrew is a member of the Royal Family who was friends with Epstein. When bad things happen, people in the news talk about them, and sometimes families like the Royal Family have to say something to show they care. Trips to other countries, like Saudi Arabia, are important for leaders to meet and talk with others."
