  "title": "What Hedgehogs Do at Night in Gardens",
  "summary": "Scientists used hidden cameras to watch hedgehogs in gardens at night. They studied over 400 gardens in Chester and found hedgehogs in more than half of them. Hedgehogs are small, spiny animals that come out after dark. They like to visit gardens because they can find food there. Hedgehogs are in danger because their numbers are going down. People can help by leaving out food that is good for hedgehogs and making gardens friendly with wildflowers and holes in fences. This study helps us learn how to protect hedgehogs so they can survive.",

    "Hedgehogs are nocturnal mammals found in the UK, known for their spiny backs and ability to roll into a ball for protection. They face threats like habitat loss and road accidents, leading to declining populations. Gardens provide essential spaces for them to find food and shelter, especially as natural areas shrink. This study uses cameras to observe their behavior, highlighting how human actions can support their survival."
