  "title": "Journalist Don Lemon Arrested for Covering a Protest",
  "summary": "Don Lemon, a journalist, was arrested in Los Angeles for covering a protest at a church in Minnesota. The protest was about immigration rules and happened at a church where people were worshiping. Lemon and others are charged with interfering with the church service and conspiring to break the law. He says he was just doing his job as a journalist to report the news and will not stop. After a court appearance, he was released and plans to fight the charges. Another journalist, Georgia Fort, and two protest participants were also arrested in Minnesota. Lemon used to work for CNN but was fired in 2023. He says he was at the protest alone to document what happened, not as part of the protest group. The case involves federal civil rights charges, meaning the government says their actions violated people's rights during the protest.",

    "This article is about a news event involving Don Lemon, a well-known journalist who used to work on TV for CNN. In 2026, he was arrested for covering a protest at a church in Minnesota. The protest was about immigration, which is how people move to live in a new country. Lemon says he was just doing his job to report the truth, but the government charged him with interfering with the church service. This case raises questions about freedom of the press, which is the right for journalists to report news without being stopped. It's important because it shows how journalists work to share information, even in difficult situations."
