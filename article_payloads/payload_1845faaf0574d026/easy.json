  "title": "Greenland Says No to U.S. Takeover",
  "summary": "Greenland is a big island that is part of Denmark but has its own government. President Donald Trump of the United States wants the U.S. to take control of Greenland. He says if the U.S. doesn't own it, other countries like Russia or China might take it. Greenland's leaders, including Prime Minister Jens-Frederik Nielsen, have said no to this idea. They want Greenland to be independent and for its people to decide their own future. They don't want to be Americans or Danes; they want to be Greenlanders. The leaders made a statement to tell everyone that Greenland's future should be decided by Greenlanders, not by other countries. They are talking with the U.S. and Denmark to solve this issue, but they stand firm in their decision.",

    "Greenland is a large island in the Arctic Ocean. It is part of Denmark, which is a country in Europe, but Greenland has its own government to make some decisions. The United States is a big country that sometimes wants to control other places for safety or resources. In this article, Greenland's leaders are saying they want to be independent and not controlled by the U.S. or anyone else. This is important because it shows how countries can disagree about who should be in charge of a place."
