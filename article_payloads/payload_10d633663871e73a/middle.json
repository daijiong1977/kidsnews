Olivia Dean emerged as a major victor, sweeping all categories she was nominated in, including artist of the year, song of the year, best pop artist, and best album for 'The Art Of Loving.' Her emotional acceptance speeches highlighted the collaborative effort behind her success. Meanwhile, Rosalía delivered a captivating performance of her single 'Berghain,' blending operatic elements with club music and featuring a guest appearance by Björk in an unconventional costume, which mesmerized the audience. Harry Styles opened the event with a choreographed routine in a school uniform-inspired suit, introducing his new musical direction towards a clubbier sound. Host Jack Whitehall added humor with witty commentary, such as comparing Styles' performance to 'sitting on the washing machine.' The article emphasizes that beyond the awards, the night was defined by artistic expression, fashion statements, and entertainment, revealing both expected winners and unexpected highlights.",
