  "summary": "The Brit Awards is a big music show that celebrates the best pop stars from the UK and other places. This year, Olivia Dean was a huge winner! She won every award she was up for, including artist of the year and best album. She felt very happy and thanked everyone. Other stars also did amazing things. Rosalía sang a song that started like an opera and ended like a dance party, and she had a special guest, Björk, who wore a funny costume. Harry Styles opened the show by dancing in a school uniform suit and performed a new song. The host, Jack Whitehall, made jokes about the performances. It was a night full of music, fun, and surprises!",
