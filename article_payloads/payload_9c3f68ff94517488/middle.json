    "Remembrance events are ceremonies held to honor and remember military personnel who have died in service, often involving moments of silence, wreath-laying, and speeches. Impersonating a military officer, such as a navy admiral, is illegal in many countries because it can lead to fraud, misuse of authority, and disrespect towards those who have served. Navy admirals hold high ranks responsible for commanding fleets, and their uniforms symbolize honor and duty. Police investigations in such cases focus on gathering evidence, like seized items, to build a case for potential charges like impersonation or fraud, emphasizing the need for public vigilance and respect for military traditions."
