    "A remembrance event is a ceremony where people gather to remember and honor soldiers who have served in the military, often with moments of silence, speeches, and laying wreaths. Navy admirals are high-ranking officers who lead ships and sailors, and wearing their uniform without permission is against the law because it shows disrespect and can mislead others. Police investigations help find out why someone broke the rules to keep everyone safe."
