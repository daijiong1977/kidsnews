  "title": "Walking Longer is Healthier Than Walking Short",
  "summary": "A big study looked at how people walk every day and if it affects their health. It found that walking in long sessions without stopping is better for your health than walking in many short bursts. The study included over 33,000 adults who walked less than 8,000 steps per day. People who walked for longer times, like 15 minutes or more at once, had lower risks of dying or getting heart disease. This was especially true for people who were not very active. So, if you don't move much, try to walk for longer periods to stay healthier, even if you don't walk more steps overall.",

    "This article is about a scientific study that looked at how walking affects health. Scientists studied adults who didn't walk much to see if the way they walked made a difference. They found that walking for longer times without stopping can help people live longer and avoid heart problems. This is important because it shows that even if you don't walk a lot, doing it in longer chunks can keep you healthier. It's a simple tip for people who want to stay active and safe."
