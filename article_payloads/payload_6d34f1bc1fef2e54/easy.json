  "title": "Heathrow Airport Makes Travel Easier with New Scanners",
  "summary": "Heathrow Airport in London has installed new high-tech scanners that make going through security much easier for passengers. Now, people can leave liquids like shampoo or water in containers up to two liters in their bags, instead of taking them out. They also don't need to use clear plastic bags for liquids anymore. Electronics such as laptops can stay in luggage too. This change helps speed up security lines and makes traveling less stressful. However, this only applies to flights leaving Heathrow, so passengers should check rules at other airports when returning. Other UK airports like Gatwick and Edinburgh have similar scanners, but some are still waiting for permission to raise the liquid limit. The new scanners provide better images to keep everyone safe while making the process faster.",

    "Airports have rules to keep travelers safe. For many years, passengers had to take liquids out of their bags and put them in clear plastic bags at security. This was because old scanners couldn't see liquids well. Now, new high-tech scanners can look inside bags better, so rules are changing to make travel easier. Heathrow is a major airport in the UK that has updated all its scanners, allowing bigger liquid containers and keeping electronics in bags. This helps reduce wait times and stress for families and other travelers."
