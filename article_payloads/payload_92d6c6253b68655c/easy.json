  "title": "President Trump's New Tariffs Start at 10%",
  "summary": "President Donald Trump has started new tariffs, which are taxes on goods from other countries, at a rate of 10%. He first said they would be 15%, but official papers show they are 10% for now. These tariffs are meant to help American workers and businesses by making foreign goods more expensive. However, they can cause problems like uncertainty for companies and might lead to other countries taxing US goods in return. The Supreme Court, a high court in the US, recently said some of Trump's past tariffs were not allowed, which could mean businesses get money back. Experts think this could be messy and take a long time to sort out.",

    "Tariffs are taxes that countries put on goods from other countries to make them more expensive. This can protect local businesses but might lead to trade wars where countries tax each other back. In the US, the president can set tariffs, but courts like the Supreme Court can say if they are allowed or not. This article talks about President Trump's new tariffs and how they affect businesses and trade."
