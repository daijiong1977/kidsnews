  "title": "Trump's Tariffs Implemented at 10% Amid Legal and Economic Uncertainty",
  "summary": "President Donald Trump's new global tariffs have taken effect at a 10% rate, lower than his initial pledge of 15%, following Supreme Court rulings that challenged his authority. The tariffs, imposed under Section 122 of the 1974 Trade Act, aim to address international payments issues and rebalance trade to benefit American workers, farmers, and manufacturers. However, this move has sparked concerns among analysts like Carsten Brzeski of ING, who warns of increased uncertainty and a higher risk of retaliatory tariffs from trading partners, potentially escalating into a full trade war. The US trade deficit recently hit a record high of $1.2 trillion, undermining the tariff's goal. Additionally, the Supreme Court's decision that Trump overstepped with previous tariffs under the IEEPA could lead to billions in refunds for businesses, as seen in FedEx's lawsuit. Campaign groups are demanding refunds, but experts doubt quick resolutions, with Trump predicting lengthy court battles. This situation highlights the complex interplay between presidential power, economic policy, and legal constraints in shaping US trade relations.",

    "Tariffs are tools used by governments to tax imports, often to protect domestic industries or address trade imbalances. In the US, the president has authority under laws like Section 122 of the 1974 Trade Act and IEEPA to impose tariffs, but this power is subject to legal challenges. The Supreme Court plays a key role in interpreting these laws, as seen in recent rulings on Trump's tariffs. Trade deficits occur when a country imports more than it exports, and tariffs aim to reduce this gap. However, they can lead to retaliatory measures from other countries, escalating into trade wars that harm global economies. This article explores the implementation of Trump's tariffs, their economic impacts, and the legal controversies surrounding them."
