  "title": "Is Winter Over? A Look at Spring Weather",
  "summary": "The UK recently had its warmest day of the year, with temperatures reaching almost 19°C, making it feel like spring. Flowers like daffodils and cherry blossoms are blooming. Spring officially starts in March, April, and May, and on March 20, the northern hemisphere tilts toward the sun, bringing more warmth. Winds from the south can make it warm, while winds from the north or east can bring cold, wintry weather. In March 2018, a cold spell called the 'Beast from the East' brought snow. So, winter might not be completely over yet, as weather can change quickly in spring.",

People often see flowers like daffodils and enjoy outdoor activities. However, spring weather can be unpredictable, with some warm days and some cold days, so it's important to be prepared for changes."
