  "title": "Les Wexner's Congressional Testimony on Epstein Ties",
  "summary": "Les Wexner, the billionaire founder of retail brands like Victoria's Secret, testified before Congress in a deposition about his relationship with Jeffrey Epstein. He claimed he was deceived by Epstein, whom he described as a con man, and denied any knowledge of or involvement in Epstein's sexual abuse crimes. Wexner stated that their association ended in 2007 after he discovered Epstein had been stealing from him, and he aimed to dispel rumors and innuendo that have plagued him since. The deposition, which lasted six hours, was subpoenaed by Democrats following the release of new Epstein-related documents by the Justice Department. During the proceeding, Wexner presented himself as an ethical philanthropist and grandfather. However, Rep. Robert Garcia expressed skepticism, alleging that Wexner provided significant financial support that enabled Epstein's crimes. This highlights ongoing scrutiny into the connections between wealthy individuals and Epstein's network.",
