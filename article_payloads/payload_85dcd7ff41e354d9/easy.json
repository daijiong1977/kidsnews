  "title": "Vets Worry About Money and Pet Owners",
  "summary": "Vets in the UK are feeling more pressure to make money for big companies that own vet clinics. This makes them worry about pet owners who have to pay high bills for their pets' care. Prices for vet services have gone up a lot since 2016. Many pet owners are upset because they paid thousands of pounds for treatments that did not always help their pets. A government group is checking if pet owners are getting a fair deal. Some vets say their companies use charts to track how many tests and treatments they do, which might push them to do more expensive things. The companies say they always put animal health first, but vets are still concerned.",
