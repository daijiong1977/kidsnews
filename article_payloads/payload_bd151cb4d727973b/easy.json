  "title": "Finding New Animals and Plants Every Day",
  "summary": "Scientists are discovering more new species than ever before. A long time ago, a man named Carl Linnaeus started naming plants and animals. Today, researchers find over 16,000 new species each year, like insects, plants, and frogs. This is good news because it means we are learning about Earth's biodiversity faster than species are going extinct. The discoveries help us protect these species and can lead to new medicines and inventions. Scientists use tools to look at traits and genes to find species that look alike but are different. They think there might be millions more species to discover, showing we live in a golden age of finding new life.",

    "This article talks about how scientists are finding new plants and animals faster than ever. It explains that a man named Carl Linnaeus began naming species long ago, and now researchers discover over 16,000 new species each year. This helps us learn about Earth's variety of life, protect species from extinction, and find new medicines and technologies. Scientists use methods like looking at traits and genes to identify species, and they believe many more are waiting to be found, making this a special time for discovery."
