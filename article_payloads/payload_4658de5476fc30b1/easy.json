  "title": "ULA's Rocket Launch Plans for 2025",
  "summary": "United Launch Alliance (ULA) is a company that launches rockets into space. Last year, they hoped to launch up to 10 of their new Vulcan rockets in 2025, but they will only launch one this year. They are still busy with other rockets like the Atlas V, which will fly five times. The Vulcan rocket had its only flight in August for the US Space Force, carrying important satellites. ULA works with big customers like Amazon and the Space Force to send satellites for internet and security. Delays happened because of a problem with the rocket's boosters in 2024. Now, more Vulcan launches are planned for next year to catch up.",
