  "title": "Japanese Singer Stopped Mid-Song in China",
  "summary": "A Japanese singer named Maki Otsuki was performing a song from the popular anime 'One Piece' at a music festival in Shanghai, China, when suddenly the lights and music went off. She was quickly taken off stage by crew members. This happened because there are tensions between China and Japan over political issues, like comments made by Japan's leader about Taiwan. China sees Taiwan as part of its country and doesn't want others to interfere. Other Japanese music events in Shanghai were also canceled, including a concert by pop star Ayumi Hamasaki, which left fans upset and calling the actions rude. The cancellations are linked to these disagreements, affecting cultural exchanges and daily life in both countries.",
