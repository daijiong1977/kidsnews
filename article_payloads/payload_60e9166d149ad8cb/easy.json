  "title": "Greenland Stands Up for Itself",
  "summary": "In Greenland, thousands of people marched to say they want to keep their own country. They were upset because U.S. President Donald Trump has talked about taking over Greenland. Greenland is a big, cold island with lots of minerals, and it governs itself. The marchers walked in the capital city, Nuuk, to the U.S. Consulate. They held signs and flags and chanted that Greenland is not for sale. They want to protect their culture and families. At the same time, Trump announced a new tax on goods from some European countries. People in other places like Denmark and Canada also showed support. This protest was big, with many families joining to speak up for their home.",

    "Greenland is a big island in the Arctic that is very cold and has lots of ice and snow. It is part of Denmark but makes many of its own decisions. People there have their own language and traditions. Recently, the U.S. President said he might want to take over Greenland because it has valuable minerals and is in a good location. This made many Greenlanders worried, so they marched to show they want to stay independent and keep their way of life."
