  "title": "EU Summit Approves Ukraine Loan Amidst Internal Divisions",
  "summary": "After a tense 17-hour summit, EU leaders reached an agreement to provide Ukraine with €90 billion in zero-interest loans to sustain its financial needs over the next two years. This decision comes as the United States, under Donald Trump, has reduced direct military aid to Ukraine, forcing the war-torn nation to rely more heavily on European support. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky emphasized that without this funding, Ukraine would lack resources to pay soldiers and procure weapons against Russian aggression. The loan will be backed by the EU's common budget, but the agreement faced challenges due to divisions among member states. Hungary, Slovakia, and the Czech Republic only consented to the plan—which required unanimous approval—on the condition of individual exemptions, highlighting their closer ties to the Kremlin. In contrast, countries like Poland and the Baltic States view Ukraine's survival as vital to European security, warning that a Ukrainian defeat could embolden Russia and destabilize the region. The new loan scheme replaces a controversial proposal to utilize frozen Russian assets, reflecting ongoing debates within the EU over the best approach to support Ukraine while managing internal disagreements.",

    "The European Union (EU) is a political and economic union of 27 member states in Europe, established to promote cooperation and integration. Ukraine, a non-EU country in Eastern Europe, has been engaged in a full-scale war with Russia since February 2022, following Russia's invasion. The conflict has led to significant destruction and humanitarian crises, with Western countries providing aid to Ukraine. The United States has been a major supporter, but political changes, such as Donald Trump's presidency, have affected aid levels. The EU uses mechanisms like common budgets and loans to address crises, but decisions often require unanimity, leading to debates among members with differing foreign policies, particularly regarding Russia. Countries like Hungary have maintained closer relations with Moscow, while others, such as Poland, perceive Russia as a direct threat to regional security."
