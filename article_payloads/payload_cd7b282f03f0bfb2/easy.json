  "title": "EU Leaders Help Ukraine with Money",
  "summary": "EU leaders had a long meeting and agreed to give Ukraine a big loan of 90 billion euros to help it fight against Russia. Ukraine needs this money to pay its soldiers and buy weapons because the US is not giving as much help now. All EU countries had to agree, but Hungary, Slovakia, and the Czech Republic only said yes if they did not have to pay. This shows that some countries in Europe are closer to Russia and do not want to help Ukraine as much. Other countries like Poland and the Baltic States think helping Ukraine is very important for keeping Europe safe. They believe if Ukraine loses, Russia might become more dangerous. The loan is a new plan instead of using frozen Russian money. The meeting was tense, but they found a way to help Ukraine.",
