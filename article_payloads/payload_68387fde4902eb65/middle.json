  "title": "Raducanu's Setback in Hobart Ahead of Australian Open",
  "summary": "Emma Raducanu, the British number one and top seed at the Hobart International, suffered a surprising defeat to world number 204 Taylah Preston in the quarter-finals. This loss, with a score of 6-2 6-4, comes just before the Australian Open, impacting her preparations. Raducanu struggled with inconsistency, particularly on serve, committing four double faults and holding only three of nine service games. Despite leading in both sets, she could not maintain her advantage, partly due to rain-affected conditions. Her coach, Francisco Roig, encouraged her to be more aggressive, but she failed to capitalize. This match adds to recent challenges, including a foot injury and a loss to Maria Sakkari earlier in the season. Raducanu has only one win from three outings this year, raising concerns about her form. At the Australian Open, she will start against Mananchaya Sawangkaew, with a potential third-round clash against world number one Aryna Sabalenka, highlighting the tough competition ahead.",
