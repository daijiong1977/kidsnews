  "title": "Emma Raducanu Loses Tennis Match Before Big Tournament",
  "summary": "Emma Raducanu, a famous tennis player from Britain, lost a match to Taylah Preston, who is ranked 204th in the world. This happened in Hobart, Australia, right before the Australian Open, which is a very important tennis tournament. Raducanu was the top seed, meaning she was expected to do well, but she struggled with her serves and made mistakes. She had only won one match recently, so this loss is a setback. Now, she will go to Melbourne for the Australian Open, where she might face the world number one player, Aryna Sabalenka, later on. This article talks about how athletes can have ups and downs in their careers.",
