  "title": "Legal Threat Over Free Speech at University After Protest Disruption",
  "summary": "Prof Alice Sullivan, who led a government review on sex and gender data collection, has threatened legal action against the University of Bristol, alleging it failed to uphold her freedom of speech. Her talk at the university was disrupted by a trans rights protest, and she claims the university did not adequately protect her right to express her views. In response, the University of Bristol rejected these claims, stating that the event proceeded safely and in line with their commitment to free speech, despite what they called 'unacceptable disruption.' Universities in England have a legal duty to balance free speech with the right to protest, especially under a new law that took effect in August. Prof Sullivan's lawyers sent a letter warning of a potential legal challenge, arguing that complaints from the LGBTQ+ staff network influenced the university's actions, such as initially suggesting an online format. The Office for Students (OfS) has issued guidance to help universities implement the new free speech law, emphasizing that events should not be denied based on a speaker's opinions and should proceed safely within legal bounds.",
