  "title": "A University Gets a Warning After a Talk is Disrupted",
  "summary": "A professor named Alice Sullivan gave a talk at the University of Bristol, but some people protested during it because they disagreed with her ideas. She is upset and says the university did not protect her right to speak freely. The university says they did keep her safe and support free speech. Universities have rules to let people share their thoughts, even if others find them upsetting, while also allowing peaceful protests. Prof Sullivan wrote a letter threatening to take the university to court over this issue. She had done a review for the government about collecting data on sex and gender. The protest was about trans rights, and she feels the university listened too much to complaints instead of helping her talk go smoothly.",

    "This article is about a conflict at a university in England. Universities are places where people learn and share ideas, and they have rules to protect everyone's right to speak, even if others disagree. Sometimes, protests happen to show disagreement, and this can lead to arguments about how to balance speaking and protesting. Prof Sullivan is a professor who did work for the government, and she feels her talk was not handled fairly by the university."
