  "title": "Raducanu's Return from Injury and GB's United Cup Elimination",
  "summary": "Emma Raducanu, the British tennis star, made her return to competition after a foot injury that had sidelined her since early October. She missed Great Britain's opening United Cup match against Japan due to what she described as 'light bone bruising' on her right foot, a precautionary move. In her comeback match, she faced Greece's Maria Sakkari in a crucial tie that could have secured Britain's quarter-final spot. Despite showing positive signs like free movement and quality shots, Raducanu lost 6-3 3-6 6-1, with some rustiness evident in the physical contest. This defeat, combined with other losses, led to Britain's elimination from the mixed team event. Raducanu expressed confidence from her performance, noting she had only resumed hitting two weeks prior and needs more practice. The team managed a consolation win in mixed doubles, but concerns persist about Raducanu's injury-prone body as she aims to build a better version of herself in the new year.",

    "Emma Raducanu rose to fame by winning the 2021 US Open as a qualifier, but her career has been marred by injuries, including wrist and ankle issues.
