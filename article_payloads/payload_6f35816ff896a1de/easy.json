  "title": "Emma Raducanu's Tennis Comeback and Team Loss",
  "summary": "Emma Raducanu is a tennis player from Great Britain who had a foot injury and couldn't play for a long time. She came back to play in the United Cup, a team tennis event, but lost her match to Maria Sakkari from Greece. This loss meant Great Britain could not advance to the next round and was eliminated from the tournament. Even though she lost, Raducanu showed good movement and fighting spirit during the game. She said she needs to practice more to get better. Other British players also lost their matches, but they won one in mixed doubles. Raducanu is working to become a stronger player after her injury.",
