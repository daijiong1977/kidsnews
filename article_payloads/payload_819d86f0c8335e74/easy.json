  "title": "Northern Lights Will Light Up the Sky in 2026",
  "summary": "In 2026, people in the UK might see the Northern Lights, which are colorful lights in the sky. The Sun has an 11-year cycle where it gets more active and then less active. Right now, the Sun is still very active even though the peak was in 2024. In November 2025, a big solar flare from the Sun made the Northern Lights visible in the UK, even in southern areas like Devon and Cornwall. Solar flares send energy to Earth, creating these beautiful lights. Even as the Sun gets quieter towards 2031, one big flare in 2026 could still make the Northern Lights appear. This is exciting because it means more chances to see this natural wonder.",

    "The Northern Lights, also called auroras, are natural light displays in the sky, usually seen near the poles. They happen when particles from the Sun hit Earth's atmosphere. The Sun goes through cycles where it gets more active with sunspots and solar flares, which can make the lights brighter and visible in more places. In 2026, the Sun will still be active enough to possibly create these lights in the UK, giving people a chance to see something special from nature."
