  "title": "Government Releases Papers About a Bad Man Named Epstein",
  "summary": "The Justice Department, which is part of the government, started giving out many papers about Jeffrey Epstein. He was a man who did bad things to people and was in trouble with the law. The papers have photos, phone records, and court papers, but lots of the words are covered up with black marks, which is called redacted. This means we can't see all the information. A reporter named Liz Landers is looking at the papers and says there are thousands of them, but not as many as expected. Some papers have lists with names that are all covered up, and there is an important court document from a big case against Epstein. The release will take a few weeks to finish, and people are interested to learn more from these hidden papers.",
