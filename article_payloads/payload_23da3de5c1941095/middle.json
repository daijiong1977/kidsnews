  "title": "The Impact of Celebrity Endorsement on an Independent Musician",
  "summary": "This article explores how a casual mention by actor Paul Mescal significantly boosted the career of singer Michael McGovern. In a December interview, Mescal, known for roles in Gladiator II and Hamnet, expressed admiration for McGovern's song 'Evelyn' from his album Thin White Road. Although Mescal couldn't recall McGovern's name, this endorsement led to a dramatic increase in McGovern's popularity, with music listens surging by 700% and new fans, particularly younger ones, discovering his work. McGovern, an East Kilbride-based folk musician, found the situation humorous and forgave Mescal, noting that people often forget artist names. The article highlights how social media platforms like TikTok and Instagram amplified this effect, transforming McGovern's career trajectory. Previously, he had built a following through 15 years of gigs, but now he is selling out shows nationwide, including three nights in London. The piece also touches on McGovern's musical journey, starting with guitar alongside friend and drummer Callum Little, and emphasizes the lasting impact of celebrity support on independent artists.",
