  "title": "A Famous Family's Wedding Dance Mix-Up",
  "summary": "Brooklyn Beckham, the son of famous soccer player David Beckham and singer Victoria Beckham, got married to Nicola Peltz. At their wedding, there was a confusing moment during a dance. The DJ, named Fat Tony, said that singer Marc Anthony called for the most beautiful woman to dance with Brooklyn. Everyone thought it would be Nicola, but he said Victoria's name instead. This made Nicola run out crying, and Brooklyn felt sad because he wanted to dance with his wife first. Victoria danced with Brooklyn, and it felt awkward for everyone there. Some reports say the first dance happened earlier with Nicola, but the DJ's story is different. This shows how family events can have mix-ups that upset people.",
