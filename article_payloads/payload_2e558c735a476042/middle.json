  "summary": "Emma Raducanu, the British number one tennis player, secured a spot in the semi-finals of the Transylvania Open by defeating Maja Chwalinska of Poland with a score of 6-0, 6-4. This victory marks only her fourth semi-final appearance since her remarkable 2021 US Open win.

This success follows her recent split from coach Francis Roig after an early exit at the Australian Open, and she now aims for her first final since the US Open. In the semi-finals, she will face Oleksandra Oliynykova from Ukraine, who earned her first top-50 win against Wang Xinyu to reach a WTA Tour semi-final. Additionally, Katie Boulter advanced to the Ostrava Open semi-finals by beating Linda Fruhvirtova, marking her first semi-final since last year. The article underscores players' efforts to rebound from setbacks and achieve tournament milestones.",
