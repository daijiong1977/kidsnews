  "title": "Neil Young Helps Greenlanders with Free Music",
  "summary": "Neil Young is a famous singer who is giving people in Greenland free access to his music archives for one year. He wants to help them feel better because they are worried about threats from the U.S. government. Greenland is a place that belongs to Denmark, and the U.S. president has talked about taking it over, but later said he would talk instead. Neil Young often speaks out about politics and does not like the president. He hopes other groups will also help Greenlanders. To get the free music, people in Greenland need a phone number from there. Neil Young has done other things to protest, like asking people not to use Amazon and stopping his music from being on Spotify because of a podcast he did not like. He was born in Canada but also lives in the U.S.",
