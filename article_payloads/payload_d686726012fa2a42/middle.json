  "title": "Neil Young's Free Archive Offer to Greenland Amid Political Tensions",
  "summary": "Neil Young, a Canadian-American rock musician and political activist, is offering Greenlanders one year of free access to his digital archives as a gesture of support. This move aims to alleviate stress caused by threats from the Trump administration, which has considered annexing Greenland for national security reasons, though recently shifted to seeking negotiations. Young, a vocal critic of President Trump, announced this 'peace and love' offer on his website, encouraging other organizations to follow suit. Access typically costs around $25, but Greenlanders can verify with a local mobile number. Young has a history of political protests, including legal action against Trump's use of his music, calls to boycott Amazon over donations to Trump, and a boycott of Spotify due to Joe Rogan's podcast spreading misinformation. He ended the Spotify boycott after Rogan's multi-platform deal. Young's actions highlight his ongoing activism against policies he opposes, using his platform to advocate for social issues.",
