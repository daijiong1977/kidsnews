  "title": "Why Did Americans Spend Less Money in December?",
  "summary": "In December, Americans spent about the same amount of money as in November, which was a surprise because they usually spend more during the holidays. This happened because people were worried about jobs, prices going up, and not getting bigger paychecks. The government report showed that sales at furniture and clothing stores went down a little. However, experts think this might not last long. They say that if people keep their jobs and get tax refunds, spending could go back up. Consumer spending is very important for the US economy because it makes up more than two-thirds of all economic activity. So, this slowdown is something to watch, but it might just be a short break.",

    "Consumer spending is when people buy things like food, clothes, and toys. In the US, this is very important because it helps the economy grow. During December, which includes holidays like Christmas, people usually spend more money on gifts. However, in 2025, a report showed that spending didn't increase as expected. This might be because people were concerned about losing their jobs or prices going up. Experts are watching to see if this is just a short problem or if it could mean bigger issues for the economy."
