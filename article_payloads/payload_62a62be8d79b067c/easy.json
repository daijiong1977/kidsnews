  "title": "A Smiling Fossil Found on a Special Island",
  "summary": "Christine Clark was walking on Holy Island in Northumberland when she found a small fossil that looked like it was smiling at her. She thought it resembled fake teeth. Christine often visits this island with her husband to search for fossils called Cuddy's beads, which are parts of an ancient sea animal called a crinoid. Holy Island is a small place with only 150 people and is important for early English Christianity. The beads got their name from St. Cuthbert, a saint who lived there long ago. People used to think these fossils were made by Cuthbert and could make them more spiritual. Christine posted her find on Facebook, and many people liked it. Experts from the British Geological Survey said it is a bigger piece of a crinoid. Crinoids are very old sea animals that have been around for over 500 million years and are sometimes called sea lilies because they look like flowers.",

    "Holy Island is a small island in Northumberland, England, with only about 150 people living there. It is cut off from the mainland twice a day when the tide comes in. Long ago, it was an important place for early English Christianity because St. Cuthbert lived and was buried there. People have been finding fossils called Cuddy's beads on the island for hundreds of years. These beads are actually parts of ancient sea animals called crinoids, which lived over 500 million years ago. Crinoids are sometimes called sea lilies because they look like flowers underwater. Today, people like Christine enjoy hunting for these fossils as a fun activity."
