  "title": "Labour MPs Disagree with Party Decision on Mayor Burnham",
  "summary": "About 50 Labour MPs have written a letter to their leader, Sir Keir Starmer, because they are unhappy with a decision. The decision stops Andy Burnham, who is the Mayor of Greater Manchester, from running in a special election for a seat in Parliament. The MPs think this is a bad idea because Andy Burnham might be the best person to win that seat for Labour. They say there is no good reason to block him and want the party's leaders to think again. Sir Keir says letting Burnham run would take away resources like money and people from other important elections. The letter has caused a lot of worry and anger among Labour members. Some other Labour leaders also signed the letter. The party's ruling group voted to block Burnham, with most members agreeing.",

    "In the UK, the Labour Party is one of the main political groups. MPs are people elected to Parliament to make laws. Mayors like Andy Burnham lead big cities or regions. Sometimes, when a seat in Parliament becomes empty, a special election called a by-election is held. Parties decide who can run in these elections. Leaders like Sir Keir Starmer make decisions for their party. Resources are important for elections because they help with campaigning."
