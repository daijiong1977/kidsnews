  "title": "New Accusations Against Prince Andrew in Epstein Case",
  "summary": "A lawyer representing a second woman alleges that she was sent to the UK by Jeffrey Epstein for a sexual encounter with Prince Andrew in 2010. The woman, who was in her 20s and not British, claims the encounter occurred at Royal Lodge, Prince Andrew's residence. After spending the night, she says she received a tour of Buckingham Palace and tea. The BBC has sought comment from Prince Andrew, but he has not responded. The lawyer, Brad Edwards, represents over 200 Epstein survivors, including Virginia Giuffre, who previously accused Prince Andrew of sexual misconduct in 2001 when she was 17. Epstein was convicted in 2008 for soliciting sex from a minor. In 2022, Prince Andrew was stripped of his royal titles by King Charles, which the lawyer argues hinders compensation for victims. The article highlights ongoing legal and royal implications from the Epstein scandal.",

    "This article discusses new allegations in the Jeffrey Epstein scandal, involving Prince Andrew of the British royal family. Epstein was a financier convicted of sex crimes with minors, linked to a network of powerful individuals. Prince Andrew has faced multiple accusations, including from Virginia Giuffre, leading to his removal from royal duties and titles in 2022. The legal process involves survivors seeking justice and compensation, with lawyers like Brad Edwards advocating for them. The royal family's response and the challenges in verifying claims add complexity to the case, reflecting broader issues of accountability and victim support in high-profile scandals."

  "Article_Structure": [
    "This article presents main points about a second woman accusing Prince Andrew of a sexual encounter arranged by Jeffrey Epstein in 2010, with details of a palace tour. Its purpose is to report new allegations and highlight ongoing legal battles from the Epstein scandal. Evidence includes lawyer statements and historical context from previous cases like Virginia Giuffre's, though some claims lack direct corroboration due to privacy concerns. Author credibility stems from BBC News as a reputable source, but the article relies on lawyer accounts without Prince Andrew's response. Methodology involves interviewing the lawyer and reviewing public records, but it notes limitations in verifying the woman's identity and visit. Overall, it critically assesses the impact of title removal on victim compensation and royal accountability."
