  "title": "A Woman's Story About a Prince",
  "summary": "A lawyer says a woman claims she was sent to the UK by Jeffrey Epstein to meet Prince Andrew for a sexual encounter in 2010. She was in her 20s and not from the UK. The meeting happened at Prince Andrew's home called Royal Lodge. After spending the night, she says she got a tour of Buckingham Palace and had tea. The BBC asked Prince Andrew for his side, but he has not replied yet. The lawyer works for many people who say they were hurt by Epstein, including Virginia Giuffre, who also accused Prince Andrew. Epstein was a man who went to jail for a crime with a young girl. Prince Andrew lost his royal titles last year, and the lawyer says this makes it hard for the women to get help.",
