  "title": "Oscars Shift to YouTube: A New Era for Awards Streaming",
  "summary": "The Academy Awards, commonly known as the Oscars, will transition to exclusive streaming on YouTube starting in 2029, marking a significant change in Hollywood's broadcasting landscape. The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences announced a multi-year deal granting YouTube global rights until 2033, ending a half-century run on ABC. This move aims to expand international access and attract younger audiences, as viewership has declined over decades despite a slight increase in 2025 driven by digital viewers. Academy leaders emphasize the partnership's potential to benefit the film community, while YouTube's CEO highlights its role in fostering creativity. The shift reflects broader industry trends, such as studio mergers and production cuts, and underscores the growing dominance of streaming services. ABC will continue hosting the Oscars for the next few years, but the deal signals a strategic pivot towards digital platforms to sustain relevance in an evolving media environment.",
