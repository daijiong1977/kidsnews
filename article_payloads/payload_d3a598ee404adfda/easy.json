  "summary": "The Oscars, a big awards show for movies, will start streaming on YouTube in 2029. This means you can watch it live and for free on YouTube instead of on TV. The Oscars have been on ABC for 50 years, but now YouTube will have it until 2033. The Academy, which runs the Oscars, wants more people around the world to watch. Viewership has gone down over time, but more young people watched in 2025 on their phones and computers. YouTube's CEO says this will help inspire new film lovers. ABC will still host the show for the next few years. This change shows that streaming sites like YouTube are becoming more important for watching shows.",
