  "title": "Vegan Diet Helps People with Type 1 Diabetes Use Less Insulin",
  "summary": "A new study shows that eating a low-fat vegan diet can help people with type 1 diabetes use less insulin. Insulin is a hormone that helps sugar move from the blood into cells for energy. People with type 1 diabetes need to take insulin because their bodies don't make enough. The study found that those on a vegan diet reduced their daily insulin dose by 28%, which means they needed less medicine. This diet also saved them money on insulin costs. The vegan diet does not limit calories or carbs and includes plant-based foods like fruits, vegetables, and grains. It may improve how the body responds to insulin, making it work better. This is important because insulin prices are high, and using less can help save money. The research was done by a group of doctors who study healthy eating.",

    "Type 1 diabetes is a health condition where the body cannot make enough insulin, a hormone needed to use sugar for energy. People with this condition must take insulin medicine daily. Insulin prices can be high, making it expensive. A vegan diet means eating foods from plants, like fruits and vegetables, and avoiding animal products. This study looked at how a low-fat vegan diet might help reduce the amount of insulin needed and save money."
