  "title": "Exploring Extreme Longevity in Brazil's Diverse Population",
  "summary": "Scientists in Brazil, led by Dr. Mayana Zatz, are investigating why some individuals live beyond 110 years, focusing on the country's unique genetic diversity. Published in Genomic Psychiatry, their research highlights that Brazil's population, resulting from Portuguese colonization, African slavery, and European and Japanese immigration, offers a rich mix of genetic variants often missing in global databases. This diversity is crucial for longevity studies because admixed supercentenarians may carry protective genetic factors not found in more homogeneous groups. The team has assembled a cohort of over 160 centenarians, including 20 validated supercentenarians, from various regions with different social and environmental backgrounds. Notably, some participants, like Sister Inah who lived to 116, had limited access to healthcare, suggesting biological resilience developed without medical intervention. Familial clusters, such as a 110-year-old woman with nieces aged 100, 104, and 106, provide insights into polygenic inheritance, helping disentangle genetic from environmental influences on extreme longevity. This research aims to fill gaps in existing studies by exploring underrepresented populations to uncover new insights into aging and health.",

    "Longevity research often focuses on why some people live to extreme ages, like over 110 years. Brazil offers a unique setting due to its highly admixed population from historical events like colonization and immigration. Scientists study centenarians and supercentenarians there to find genetic variants that might protect against aging, using cohorts that include individuals from diverse backgrounds with limited healthcare. This helps address gaps in global databases and explores how genes and environment interact to promote long life."
