  "title": "Why Some People in Brazil Live Past 110 Years Old",
  "summary": "In Brazil, some people live to be over 110 years old, and scientists are curious about why this happens. A team of researchers, led by Dr. Mayana Zatz, is studying these very old people to find answers. Brazil has a special mix of people from different backgrounds, like Portuguese, African, European, and Japanese, which makes its population unique. This diversity helps scientists discover new things about genes that might help people live longer. The study includes over 160 people who are 100 years or older, including 20 who are over 110. Some of these old people lived in areas with little healthcare, showing they are naturally strong. One family has many members who live to be very old, like a 110-year-old woman with nieces aged 100, 104, and 106. Scientists think studying these families can help them understand how genes and lifestyle work together to help people live long lives.",
