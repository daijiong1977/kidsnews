  "summary": "John Virgo, an iconic figure in the world of snooker, has died at the age of 79, marking the loss of a veteran whose influence spanned multiple decades. His professional playing career, which lasted 18 years, was highlighted by significant accomplishments, including victory in the UK Championship and a semi-final appearance at the World Championship in 1979. Following his retirement from competitive play in 1994, Virgo seamlessly transitioned into broadcasting, becoming a staple BBC commentator renowned for his analytical prowess and distinctive catchphrase, 'where's the cue ball going?' which became synonymous with tense moments in matches. He achieved broader fame as the presenter of Big Break, a popular television series that blended snooker with entertainment from 1991 to 2002, alongside comedian Jim Davidson. Virgo's final commentary occurred 17 days prior to his death during the Masters final. The snooker community has responded with profound grief, evidenced by tributes from luminaries such as seven-time world champion Ronnie O'Sullivan, who expressed being 'gutted,' and four-time champion Mark Selby, who praised Virgo's character. Additionally, Virgo engaged in exhibition matches, showcasing trick shots and impressions that endeared him to fans, thereby cementing his legacy as a versatile and beloved personality within the sport.",
