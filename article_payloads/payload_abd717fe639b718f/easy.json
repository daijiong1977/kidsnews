  "title": "Illegal Dumps in England: A Big Problem",
  "summary": "In England, there are many illegal dumps where people throw away trash without permission. A BBC investigation found hundreds of these dumps, including 11 very big ones called 'super sites' with lots of rubbish. The Environment Agency is trying to stop them, but over 500 dumps were still active last year. These dumps are often in the countryside, hidden on farm land. Police say organized crime gangs run them to make money by charging less than legal dumps. This causes problems like fires, pollution, and safety issues for people living nearby. For example, in Gloucestershire, a dump had many trucks coming every day and fires that made smoke. Locals are upset because not enough is done to clean up the trash, which can leak into rivers and harm the environment.",

    "Illegal dumps are places where people throw away trash without following the rules. In England, there are laws to protect the environment, and legal dumps charge fees to handle waste safely. When trash is dumped illegally, it can cause fires, pollute land and water, and create safety hazards. The Environment Agency works to stop this, but it's a big challenge because criminals try to make money by avoiding these rules. This affects communities by making areas dirty and unsafe."
