  "title": "Senate Says No to Military Action in Venezuela",
  "summary": "The Senate, which is part of the U.S. government, voted to stop President Trump from sending more soldiers to Venezuela. Venezuela is a country in South America. This vote happened because some Republicans, who are usually on the president's side, joined with Democrats to say no. It was a close vote, and it means that next week, there will be a bigger debate and another vote on this idea. Even though the House of Representatives and the president might not agree, this vote is important because it shows Congress is trying to have a say in military decisions. The article explains that this is a way for Congress to use its power against the president.",
