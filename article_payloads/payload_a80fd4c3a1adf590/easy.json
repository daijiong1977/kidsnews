  "title": "A Famous Arts Center Gets a Big Makeover",
  "summary": "The Kennedy Center in Washington DC is a famous place for music and shows. President Donald Trump says it will close for two years starting in July for renovations. He announced this on social media, saying it will close on July 4th to honor America's 250th birthday. The center was recently renamed to include Trump's name, which made some artists cancel their performances. Trump says the renovations are already paid for and will make the center the best in the world. He worked with Congress to get over $250 million for the project. Some people, including members of the Kennedy family, are unhappy about the name change and have filed a lawsuit. The center was named after President John F. Kennedy after he died, and some think Congress should decide on name changes.",

    "The Kennedy Center is a performing arts center in Washington DC, named after President John F. Kennedy to honor him after his death. It hosts concerts, plays, and other events. Renovations are big projects to fix old buildings and make them new again. Presidents like Donald Trump can make announcements about government buildings. Sometimes, changing the name of a place can make people upset, especially if it was named to remember someone important. Congress is part of the U.S. government that helps decide how money is spent on projects like this."
