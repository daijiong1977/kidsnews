  "title": "Finding the 'Celtic Curse' in Scotland and Ireland",
  "summary": "Scientists have discovered that some people in Scotland and Ireland are more likely to get a sickness called hemochromatosis, which is nicknamed the 'Celtic curse'. This sickness makes the body store too much iron, which can hurt organs like the liver over many years. The study looked at genes from over 400,000 people and found that in north west Ireland, about 1 in 54 people have a special gene that increases their risk. In the Outer Hebrides, it's 1 in 62, and in Northern Ireland, it's 1 in 71. Other parts of Scotland also have higher risks. The researchers say this information can help doctors test people in these areas early, so they can get treatment like giving blood to lower iron levels and stay healthy. The study is important because it shows where the sickness is most common for the first time.",

    "Hemochromatosis is a genetic disorder that causes the body to absorb too much iron from food. Over time, this extra iron can build up in organs like the liver, heart, and pancreas, leading to damage and diseases such as liver cancer or arthritis. It is often called the 'Celtic curse' because it is more common in people with Scottish or Irish ancestry. Scientists study genes to understand why some people get it more than others. Early detection through blood tests can help manage the condition by removing excess iron through treatments like regular blood donation, which is safe and effective."
