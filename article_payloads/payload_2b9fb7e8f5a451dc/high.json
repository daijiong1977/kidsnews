  "title": "Ynys Gifftan: An Analysis of a Tidal Island Real Estate Opportunity in Wales",
  "summary": "Ynys Gifftan, a 17-acre tidal island situated in the Dwyryd Estuary near Portmeirion, Gwynedd, is listed for sale at £350,000, marginally exceeding the UK average house price. This property includes a Victorian stone farmhouse, historically occupied until the 1970s but now necessitating extensive renovation. The island's name, translating to Anne's Gift Island, reflects its historical gifting by Queen Anne in the 1700s. Access is contingent on tidal patterns: boat travel during high tide and pedestrian traversal across tidal sands at low tide, a method historically employed by residents who often waded barefoot. Estate agents from Carter Jonas emphasize the island's uniqueness, citing significant interest and organizing accompanied viewings, while cautioning about risks from the terrain and tidal conditions. The listing on Rightmove highlights expansive, unspoiled landscapes with panoramic views of Eryri National Park, though the land is overgrown and requires management. Potential buyers are envisioned as those seeking a lifestyle project or a secluded haven in Wales' coastal scenery, underscoring the blend of historical charm and contemporary challenges in such niche real estate markets.",
