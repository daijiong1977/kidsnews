  "title": "A Special Island You Can Buy",
  "summary": "There is a small island called Ynys Gifftan in Wales that you can buy for £350,000. It is a tidal island, which means you can walk to it when the water is low, but you need a boat when the water is high. The island has an old farmhouse that needs fixing up. People used to live there long ago and would take off their shoes to walk through the water to get to the mainland. Now, estate agents are selling it and many people are interested because it is a unique place with beautiful views. If you visit, you must be careful because the path can be tricky and the tides change. It could be a fun project for someone who loves nature and wants a quiet spot.",
