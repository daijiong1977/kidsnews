  "title": "Ynys Gifftan: A Tidal Island for Sale in Wales",
  "summary": "Ynys Gifftan, a 17-acre tidal island located in the Dwyryd Estuary near Portmeirion in Gwynedd, Wales, is on the market for £350,000. This price is slightly above the UK average house price. The island features a Victorian stone farmhouse that has been uninhabited since the 1970s and requires extensive renovation. Historically, residents would wade across the estuary at low tide, often removing their shoes, to access the mainland. Today, the island can be reached by boat during high tide or by walking across tidal sands at low tide. Estate agents from Carter Jonas report significant interest due to its unique nature, with the island offering panoramic views of Eryri National Park. However, potential buyers are advised to exercise caution during viewings due to risks from the terrain and tidal conditions. The listing suggests it could appeal to those seeking a lifestyle project or a secluded retreat in a picturesque coastal landscape.",
