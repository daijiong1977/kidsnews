  "title": "BBC Leaders Answer Questions from Politicians",
  "summary": "Important people from the BBC, a big TV and radio company in the UK, are going to talk to politicians called MPs. This is because there have been some problems at the BBC. One person, Michael Prescott, wrote a note that was shared with others, and it talked about mistakes in how the BBC reported news, like when they edited a speech by Donald Trump. Because of this note, the boss of the BBC and the head of news left their jobs. Other leaders, including Samir Shah, will also answer questions. The politicians want to know what happened and how to make the BBC better and more trusted. This meeting is very important to help fix the BBC's reputation.",

    "The BBC is a public service broadcaster in the UK funded by TV licenses. It is supposed to be fair and unbiased in its news reporting. Recently, there have been issues where people accused the BBC of making mistakes, like editing videos in a way that changed the meaning. This has led to bosses leaving their jobs, and now politicians are investigating to help the BBC become more trustworthy again."
