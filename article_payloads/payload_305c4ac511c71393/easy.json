  "title": "A Fun Planet Show in the Sky",
  "summary": "This weekend, you can see six planets in the sky after sunset if the weather is good. It's called a planetary parade, where planets look like they are lined up. Mercury, Venus, Saturn, and Jupiter are bright enough to see with just your eyes. But Uranus and Neptune are fainter, so you might need binoculars or a telescope to spot them. The best time to watch is on Sunday, and you should find a place with a clear view of the western horizon. Planets orbit the Sun in a flat plane, which is why they sometimes appear together like this. Jupiter will be the easiest to find because it shines brightly high in the sky. This event is special but not super rare, so enjoy the show!",

    "Planets are large objects that orbit stars like our Sun. Our solar system has eight planets, including Earth. Sometimes, from Earth, we can see multiple planets in the sky at once, which is called a planetary parade. This happens because planets move in paths around the Sun in a flat disk shape. Stargazing is fun, and tools like binoculars help us see fainter objects. Events like this remind us of the beauty of space."
