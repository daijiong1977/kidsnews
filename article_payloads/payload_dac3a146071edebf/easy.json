  "title": "Boxing Day Shopping is Getting Quieter",
  "summary": "Boxing Day shopping in the UK is not as busy as it used to be. Many people are choosing to shop online instead of going to stores. Data shows that visits to high streets and shopping centers are down compared to last year. Shoppers are expected to spend less money overall, even though some plan to spend a bit more. People are being careful with their money because of costs. Some big stores like Next and John Lewis closed on Boxing Day. Shoppers say it feels calmer and more enjoyable now. Experts think this change is because people are nervous about spending money, especially after tax announcements.",
