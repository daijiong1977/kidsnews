  "summary": "Danika Mason, a sports reporter from Australia, made a mistake by drinking alcohol before going on live TV from the Winter Olympics in Italy. She talked in a funny, slurred way and mixed up her words, which made people laugh and talk about it online. She apologized the next day, saying she should not have had a drink and that she was embarrassed. Even Australia's prime minister said he supported her and thought she might be tired from traveling. Some people online thought it was okay, while others said it was not professional. Danika is known for reporting on rugby and promised to do better next time.",
