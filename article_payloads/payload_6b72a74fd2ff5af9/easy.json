  "title": "Andy Burnham's Big Decision: To Run or Not to Run?",
  "summary": "Andy Burnham, the Mayor of Greater Manchester, has until Saturday to decide if he wants to run in a special election called a by-election in Gorton and Denton. If he wins, he could become a Member of Parliament and try to become the leader of the Labour Party, challenging the current leader, Sir Keir Starmer. But first, he needs permission from a group called the National Executive Committee (NEC) in the Labour Party. Some people in the party might try to stop him from running, which could upset others who support him. Andy Burnham hasn't said yet what he will do, but he is focused on his job as mayor. His friend Lucy Powell thinks he is a popular politician and should make his own choice. This election is important because it could affect who leads the Labour Party in the future.",
