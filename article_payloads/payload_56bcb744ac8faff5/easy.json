  "title": "Why Some Wounds Won't Heal: A Simple Explanation",
  "summary": "Scientists have found out why some wounds, like those from diabetes, take a long time to heal. They discovered that a common bacterium called Enterococcus faecalis can stop the body from fixing wounds. This bacterium makes something called hydrogen peroxide, which is like a harmful chemical that hurts skin cells. When skin cells get hurt, they can't do their job to close the wound. This is a big problem because many people around the world get these chronic wounds, and they can lead to serious issues like amputations. The good news is that by stopping this bacterium from making hydrogen peroxide, wounds might heal faster. This research was done by scientists from Singapore and Switzerland, and it could help doctors treat wounds better in the future.",
