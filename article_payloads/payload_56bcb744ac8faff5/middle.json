  "title": "Uncovering the Bacterial Barrier to Wound Healing",
  "summary": "An international research team has identified why chronic wounds, such as diabetic foot ulcers, often fail to heal. The study reveals that Enterococcus faecalis, a common bacterium found in these wounds, produces hydrogen peroxide through a metabolic process called extracellular electron transport. This hydrogen peroxide causes oxidative stress in human skin cells, specifically keratinocytes, which are responsible for wound repair. The oxidative stress triggers an unfolded protein response in the cells, impairing their ability to heal the wound. Chronic wounds affect millions globally, with diabetic foot ulcers alone impacting about 18.6 million people annually, and they are a leading cause of lower limb amputations. Antibiotic resistance in some strains of E. faecalis complicates treatment further. The research, led by scientists from Nanyang Technological University in Singapore and the University of Geneva in Switzerland, shows that blocking this bacterial process could allow wounds to heal faster. Published in Science Advances, this finding offers a potential new approach to treating stubborn wounds and reducing healthcare burdens.",

    "Chronic wounds, including diabetic foot ulcers, pressure injuries, and venous leg ulcers, are a significant global health issue, particularly affecting older adults and individuals with diabetes. They often lead to complications like infections and amputations. The rise of antibiotic-resistant bacteria adds to the challenge, making new research into alternative treatments crucial for improving patient outcomes and reducing healthcare costs."
