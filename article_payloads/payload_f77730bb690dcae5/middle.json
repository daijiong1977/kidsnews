  "title": "Unexpected Trends in Oscar Nominations: A Look at Surprises and Snubs",
  "summary": "The Oscar nominations delivered a series of surprises that defied predictions from awards experts. The event began with an unexpected nomination for Elle Fanning in the best supporting actress category, setting a tone of unpredictability. Notable snubs included Paul Mescal from Hamnet and Chase Infiniti from One Battle After Another, both considered strong contenders who missed out. While films like Hamnet and One Battle After Another underperformed in acting categories, they still garnered overall recognition. A major surprise was F1, starring Brad Pitt, securing a best picture nomination despite lacking nominations in major categories like best director or acting, highlighting its appeal to traditional Academy voters. Additionally, Sinners achieved a historic milestone with 16 nominations, surpassing previous record-holders. These developments suggest the Academy values a mix of conventional filmmaking and innovative works, reflecting broader trends in the industry.",
