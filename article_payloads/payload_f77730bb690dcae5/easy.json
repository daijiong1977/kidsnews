  "title": "Fun Surprises at the Oscar Nominations",
  "summary": "The Oscar nominations had many surprises that shocked experts. Elle Fanning got a surprise nomination for best supporting actress, starting off a list of unexpected events. Some actors like Paul Mescal and Chase Infiniti did not get nominated even though people thought they would. Other movies like Hamnet and One Battle After Another did not do as well in acting categories as expected. The movie F1, starring Brad Pitt, was a big surprise in the best picture category because it got nominated without many other major nods. Sinners broke a record with 16 nominations, more than any other movie before. The nominations show that the Academy likes different kinds of movies, from traditional ones to new hits.",
