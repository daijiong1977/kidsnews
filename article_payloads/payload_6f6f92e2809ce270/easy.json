  "summary": "Iga Swiatek is a top tennis player who says women's tennis does not need a 'Battle of the Sexes' match. Recently, Nick Kyrgios and Aryna Sabalenka played a fun exhibition game in Dubai, which Kyrgios won. Swiatek did not watch it because she thinks it was just for entertainment and not important for social change. She remembers the original 'Battle of the Sexes' in 1973 with Billie Jean King, which helped women's tennis get more respect and money. Now, Swiatek believes women's tennis is strong and has many great athletes and stories. She prefers events like the United Cup, where men and women play together in a team, making tennis more exciting for fans. This event includes singles and mixed doubles matches, like those with players from Great Britain and Japan.",
