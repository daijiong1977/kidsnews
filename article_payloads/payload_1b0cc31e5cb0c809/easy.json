  "title": "Chile Chooses a New President with Strong Views",
  "summary": "In Chile, a country in South America, people voted for a new president named José Antonio Kast. He won the election on Sunday, getting more than half of the votes. Kast is called ultra-conservative, which means he has very strong right-wing ideas. He promised to make Chile safer by reducing crime, send away immigrants who are not legally allowed to stay, and help the economy grow faster. His opponent was Jeannette Jara, who is from the leftist side and wanted different things. Many people cheered for Kast when he won. This election is important because Kast will be the most right-wing president in Chile since the country became a democracy 35 years ago. It shows that voters wanted change from the current government.",
