  "title": "Mapping the Invisible Stuff That Holds the Universe Together",
  "summary": "Scientists have made a new map of something called dark matter that we cannot see. Dark matter is a hidden part of the Universe that helps hold everything together. Using a big space telescope called James Webb, they found that dark matter pulls on normal matter, which is the stuff we can see like stars and planets. This pulling helped form galaxies like our Milky Way and planets like Earth long ago. The map shows how dark matter shaped the Universe we live in today. It is like an invisible architect that built the structures in space. Scientists from places like Durham University worked together on this study to learn more about how the Universe was made.",

    "Dark matter is a mysterious substance that makes up about 27% of the Universe, but we cannot see it because it does not give off light. Scientists think it exists because of its gravity, which affects how galaxies move and form. Normal matter, like stars and planets, is what we can see and touch. The James Webb Space Telescope is a powerful tool that helps scientists study space by looking at infrared light. This study helps us understand how the Universe was built from invisible parts."
