  "title": "Unveiling the Cosmic Blueprint: How Dark Matter Shapes Our Universe",
  "summary": "Astronomers have created the most detailed map ever of dark matter, an invisible substance that permeates the Universe, using data from NASA's James Webb Space Telescope. This research, led by institutions including Durham University, NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, and EPFL in Switzerland, reveals how dark matter's gravitational influence guided the formation of cosmic structures. The map confirms that dark matter clumped together first after the Big Bang, pulling in normal matter—the visible stuff like stars and planets—to create dense regions where galaxies could form. This process set the distribution pattern of galaxies we observe today and enabled the early formation of stars and planets, potentially fostering conditions for life. Dark matter is detected indirectly through its gravity, as it does not interact with light, and the new map shows a strong alignment between dark matter and normal matter, indicating its role as a cosmic architect. Published in Nature Astronomy, the study provides insights into the fundamental forces that shaped the Universe, highlighting dark matter's essential but unseen contribution to the cosmos we inhabit.",

    "Dark matter is a hypothetical form of matter that accounts for approximately 27% of the Universe's total mass-energy content, yet it remains undetectable by electromagnetic radiation. Its existence is inferred from gravitational effects on visible matter, such as galaxy rotation curves and cosmic microwave background observations. The James Webb Space Telescope, launched in 2021, is a successor to Hubble and specializes in infrared astronomy, allowing it to peer through cosmic dust and study early Universe phenomena. This study builds on previous cosmological models that suggest dark matter played a crucial role in structure formation after the Big Bang, by providing the gravitational scaffolding for baryonic matter to coalesce into galaxies and stars. Understanding dark matter is key to unraveling the Universe's evolution and the potential for life-supporting environments."
