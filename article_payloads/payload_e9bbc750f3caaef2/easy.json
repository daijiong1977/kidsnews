  "title": "Seeing Heat in Empty Space: A Cool Science Trick",
  "summary": "Scientists have found a clever way to see something called the Unruh effect, which is like feeling warmth in empty space when something speeds up. Normally, this effect is too tiny to notice, but researchers from Stockholm University and IISER Mohali figured out how to make it easier to see. They use atoms placed between two mirrors that act like a choir, making light together instead of alone. When the atoms speed up a little, they feel a tiny bit of warmth from empty space, and this makes the light flash a bit earlier. By measuring this timing change, scientists can spot the Unruh effect without needing super-fast speeds. This discovery helps connect everyday lab tools with extreme physics ideas, making science more exciting and accessible.",

    "The Unruh effect is a physics idea from the 1970s that says if something speeds up in empty space, it might feel a tiny bit of warmth, even though space seems cold. This is hard to see because it's very weak. Scientists use atoms and mirrors in labs to study light and how particles behave. By making atoms work together like a choir, they can create stronger signals to measure small changes, helping us learn more about space and motion."
