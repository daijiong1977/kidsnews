  "title": "Why Statins Can Hurt Muscles",
  "summary": "Statins are medicines that help lower cholesterol, but many people stop taking them because they cause muscle pain, weakness, or tiredness. Scientists at Columbia University found a reason why this happens. They discovered that some statins can stick to a protein inside muscle cells. This makes calcium leak out where it shouldn't be, which can hurt the muscles and make them weak. About 40 million adults in the U.S. take statins, and 10% have muscle problems. The scientists used a special microscope to see this happen. Now, they are trying to make new statins that don't cause muscle pain so more people can take them safely.",

    "Statins are common medicines that doctors give to people with high cholesterol to help prevent heart problems. Cholesterol is a waxy substance in the blood that can clog arteries if there's too much. Muscle pain is a common side effect that makes it hard for some people to keep taking statins. Scientists study how medicines work in the body to make them safer and more effective for everyone."
