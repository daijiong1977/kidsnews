  "title": "Scientists Find a Safer Way to Help Cells Burn Calories",
  "summary": "Scientists have found a new way to help people lose weight safely. They made special chemicals that make cells use more energy and burn extra calories. This could help treat obesity, which is when people have too much body fat and can get sick. The chemicals work by making the mitochondria, which are like tiny power plants inside cells, less efficient. Instead of making energy for the cell, some energy is released as heat. This makes cells burn more fat. In the past, similar chemicals were dangerous and could hurt people. But now, scientists have made safer versions called mild uncouplers. They tested these in a lab and found they can increase calorie burn without harming cells. This research was done by a team from Australia and Canada and was published in a science journal. It might lead to new medicines for weight loss that are safer than current options.",

    "Obesity is a condition where a person has too much body fat, which can lead to health issues like diabetes and heart disease. Cells in our bodies have mitochondria that turn food into energy. Scientists study chemicals to help people lose weight by making cells burn more calories. In the past, some weight-loss chemicals were dangerous, so researchers now aim to create safer options. This article talks about new experiments with mild uncouplers that might help without causing harm."
