  "title": "Charlotte Church Stops Using Deodorant and Shaving",
  "summary": "Charlotte Church, a singer from Wales, has shared that she no longer uses deodorant or shaves her body hair. She said this on a podcast after someone told her she smelled nice, which surprised her because she thinks she usually smells bad. She stopped using deodorant because she worries about chemicals in it. A beauty expert said more people are choosing natural beauty and not using products with chemicals. Charlotte likes wearing pretty dresses even with hairy legs, which she finds fun because it confuses people. She encourages others to do what makes them happy with their bodies, like dyeing or shaving hair if they want. The expert also said that during lockdown, people simplified their beauty routines and now see body hair as a personal choice, not something they have to do for others.",
