  "title": "Charlotte Church's Shift to Natural Beauty and Chemical Concerns",
  "summary": "Charlotte Church, a 39-year-old singer from Cardiff, disclosed on the Walking The Dog podcast that she has abandoned deodorant and stopped shaving, citing concerns about chemicals in beauty products. She expressed surprise when host Emily Dean complimented her scent, admitting she generally smells bad without deodorant. Church explained her decision stems from worries over chemical exposure, particularly in deodorants, and she has embraced her body hair for 18 months, encouraging women to make personal choices about grooming. She enjoys the contradiction of wearing elegant dresses with hairy legs, finding it amusingly confusing for others. Beauty journalist Anita Bhagwandas noted this reflects broader micro-movements where people are moving away from traditional products due to chemical anxieties, especially regarding aluminium. Bhagwandas highlighted that lockdown accelerated this trend as people simplified routines, and now decisions about shaving are viewed as personal rather than societal obligations. She emphasized that body hair has biological functions and embracing it is natural. The Cosmetic, Toiletry and Perfumery Association assured that deodorants meet safety standards, but Church's stance underscores a growing preference for natural beauty and individual autonomy in personal care.",
