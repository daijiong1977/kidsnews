  "title": "Kids and the Trans Debate: What Dr. Cass Says",
  "summary": "Dr. Hilary Cass, a doctor who wrote a big report, says kids are being used like weapons in a fight about transgender rights. Both sides in the argument are making children feel scared and upset. She talked about how social media shows pictures that are not real, which can confuse kids. Her report found that doctors don't have enough good information to help children with gender questions. She says most kids who worry about their gender will feel better as they grow up, and only a very few will need medical help like medicine or surgery. Dr. Cass thinks adults should stop arguing and focus on helping kids feel safe and happy.",

    "This article is about a report by Dr. Hilary Cass, a doctor who studied how kids with gender questions are treated. She says that in arguments about transgender rights, children are being hurt because adults on both sides use them to win fights. Social media can make things worse by showing fake pictures. Her report found that doctors don't have enough good evidence to help these kids, and most will feel better without medical treatment. Only a few kids might need medicine or surgery when they grow up. Dr. Cass wants everyone to be kinder and help kids instead of fighting."
