  "title": "NASA's Big Moon Rocket Moves to Launch Pad",
  "summary": "NASA is getting ready to send astronauts to the Moon again! A huge rocket called the Space Launch System is moving slowly from a building to a launch pad in Florida. It will carry four astronauts—Reid, Victor, Christina, and Jeremy—on a trip around the Moon. This mission is called Artemis II, and it's the first time people will go near the Moon since 1972. The rocket rides on a special crawler vehicle that goes very slow, less than one mile per hour. The astronauts will travel far from Earth and come back fast, setting a speed record. NASA wants to show that the rocket and spacecraft are safe for future Moon missions. This is exciting because it helps America return to the Moon before other countries like China.",

    "NASA is a space agency that sends rockets and astronauts into space. The Moon is Earth's natural satellite, and people first landed there in 1969 with the Apollo missions. Artemis II is part of a new program to return humans to the Moon, using big rockets and spacecraft. Astronauts train for years to go on space missions, and safety is very important. The crawler is a special vehicle built long ago to move heavy rockets slowly to launch pads."
