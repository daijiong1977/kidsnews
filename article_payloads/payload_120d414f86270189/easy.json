The church is trying to welcome LGBT+ people, but some find it hard. Most people support her, but others are hostile.

    "The Church in Wales is part of the Anglican Church, which is a Christian group. Leaders like archbishops help guide the church. Sometimes, people have different opinions about who should be a leader, especially based on things like gender or sexuality. LGBT+ stands for lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender people, who may face challenges in some communities. Respecting others means listening even when we disagree."
