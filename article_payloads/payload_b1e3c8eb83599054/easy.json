  "title": "Glasgow's Art Center Closes for Good",
  "summary": "The Centre for Contemporary Arts in Glasgow is closing forever because it ran out of money. All workers lost their jobs, and events are cancelled. This happened even though the center got a big grant of £3.4 million last year to stay open for three more years. The center had problems with payments and expenses, and people argued about its rules on boycotting Israel. A group called Creative Scotland stopped giving money because the center couldn't show it could survive. The board tried to fix things but couldn't, so they are shutting down. Staff are sad and worked hard to keep it open. The center opened in 1992 and was a place for art and culture.",

    "The Centre for Contemporary Arts (CCA) in Glasgow was a popular place for modern art, hosting exhibitions, performances, and events since 1992. It relied on funding from groups like Creative Scotland to pay for its activities and staff. Sometimes, art centers face money problems if they spend too much or don't get enough support. In this case, arguments about political issues like boycotting Israel added to the stress. When a place closes, it affects artists, workers, and the community who enjoyed it. Understanding how organizations manage money and make decisions helps explain why such closures happen."
