  "title": "Ancient Sea Cow Fossils Uncover Qatar's Marine History",
  "summary": "Researchers from the Smithsonian's National Museum of Natural History and Qatar Museums have analyzed fossils from Qatar, revealing a previously unknown species of small sea cow that lived approximately 21 million years ago during the Early Miocene. The fossils, discovered at the Al Maszhabiya site, indicate that sea cows, relatives of modern dugongs, have inhabited the Arabian Gulf for over 20 million years, shaping their environments through grazing on seagrass. This discovery highlights the long-term ecological role of sea cows in marine ecosystems. The study, published in PeerJ, also notes that modern dugongs in the Gulf face threats such as accidental fishing, coastal development, and climate change affecting seagrass meadows. By examining fossilized bones, scientists aim to learn how past seagrass communities survived environmental stresses, providing insights for conservation efforts today. The site was initially mistaken for reptile bones in the 1970s but was later identified as a rich bonebed of ancient sea cows, offering valuable data on prehistoric marine life including sharks and dolphins.",

    "Sea cows, including dugongs and manatees, are marine mammals that have existed for about 50 million years, feeding on aquatic plants like seagrass. The Arabian Gulf hosts the largest dugong herd, where their grazing activities influence marine ecosystems by stirring sediment and releasing nutrients. Fossils provide crucial insights into past environments, as soft seagrass rarely preserves. In Qatar, the Al Maszhabiya site, discovered during mining surveys in the 1970s, was later identified as containing numerous sea cow fossils from the Early Miocene. This research collaboration between U.S. and Qatari institutions aims to understand how ancient seagrass communities endured climate stresses, offering lessons for current conservation challenges such as rising temperatures and salinity affecting dugong habitats."
