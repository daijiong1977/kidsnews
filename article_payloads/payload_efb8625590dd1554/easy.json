  "title": "Tiny Sea Cow Fossils Found in Qatar",
  "summary": "Scientists found old bones in Qatar that are from a small sea cow that lived 21 million years ago. Sea cows are animals like dugongs that eat seagrass in the ocean. The fossils show that sea cows have been living in the Arabian Gulf for a very long time. The new sea cow species is much smaller than dugongs today. The fossils were found at a place called Al Maszhabiya, which was once a shallow sea with sharks and dolphins. This discovery helps us learn about the past and how sea cows shaped their homes by grazing on seagrass. It also tells us that dugongs today face problems like fishing and climate change, so understanding the past can help protect them.",

    "Sea cows are marine mammals that live in oceans and eat seagrass. Dugongs are a kind of sea cow found in places like the Arabian Gulf. Fossils are remains of ancient animals that help scientists understand life long ago. In Qatar, scientists discovered fossils of a small sea cow from 21 million years ago at a site called Al Maszhabiya. This shows that sea cows have been in this area for millions of years, grazing on seagrass and shaping their environment. Today, dugongs face threats from fishing and climate change, so studying fossils can help us protect them."
