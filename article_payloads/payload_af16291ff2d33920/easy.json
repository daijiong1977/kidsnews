  "title": "Measles Outbreak in London Schools",
  "summary": "A measles outbreak is spreading quickly in schools in north London, making many children sick. Health officials say at least 34 kids have gotten measles in Enfield, and some had to go to the hospital because they were not fully vaccinated. Measles is a very contagious disease that can cause serious health problems. Doctors and local leaders are telling families to make sure their children get the MMRV vaccine, which protects against measles, mumps, rubella, and chickenpox. They say vaccination is the best way to stop the outbreak and keep everyone safe. The outbreak is mostly affecting unvaccinated children under 10 years old in schools and nurseries. People are also being reminded to check their vaccines before traveling, as measles is common in some other countries.",

    "Measles is a disease that spreads easily through coughs and sneezes. It can cause fever, rash, and serious problems like pneumonia.

In London, health officials are worried because not enough kids are getting vaccinated, leading to outbreaks in schools. It's important for families to follow doctor advice to keep everyone healthy."
