Each series involves challenges, roundtable discussions, and eliminations, with traitors potentially recruiting new members. The format has gained popularity for its psychological tension and unexpected twists. Recently, a celebrity version aired and became one of the biggest TV successes of 2025, demonstrating the show's broad appeal.
