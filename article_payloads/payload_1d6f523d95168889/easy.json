  "title": "A Big Bone from an Ancient Elephant",
  "summary": "Archaeologists in Spain found a bone from an elephant's foot. They think it might be from a war elephant that belonged to a famous general named Hannibal long ago. Hannibal was a leader from Carthage who fought against the Romans. He is said to have brought elephants with his army across the Alps mountains into Italy during a war called the Second Punic War. The bone was discovered under a fallen wall at a place called Colina de los Quemados. Scientists used carbon dating to figure out how old it is, and they compared it to bones from modern elephants and mammoths. They also found things like weapons and coins nearby, which suggest there was a battle there. This bone could be the first real proof that Hannibal's elephants really existed and traveled through Europe, as stories have told for centuries.",

    "Hannibal was a famous general from Carthage, an ancient city in Africa. He fought against Rome in the Punic Wars, which were big conflicts over control of the Mediterranean Sea. Elephants were used in battles long ago because they were big and strong, helping armies win fights. Archaeologists are people who study old objects and places to understand history better. Carbon dating is a scientific method that measures how old something is by looking at tiny particles in it. The Alps are a mountain range in Europe that are hard to cross, making Hannibal's journey with elephants a legendary story."
