  "title": "A Tiny Pill That Glows to Check Your Tummy",
  "summary": "Scientists have made a special tiny pill that can help doctors see if your tummy is bleeding inside. This pill has tiny living things called bacteria inside it. When the pill goes into your gut, it glows if there is blood. This is important because it can help find problems like gut diseases without hurting you. In tests with mice, it worked well. This could make it easier and faster to know if someone is sick. It's like having a little light inside your body that tells secrets about your health. This new idea might change how we take care of our stomachs in the future.",
