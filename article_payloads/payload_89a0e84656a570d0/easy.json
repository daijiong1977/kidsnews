  "title": "Moms and Babies Need Better Care in Hospitals",
  "summary": "A new report says that some hospitals in England are not taking good care of moms and babies. Baroness Amos, who is leading a review, found that things are worse than she expected. Moms are sometimes hungry, wards are dirty, and some staff get mean threats. Some moms feel blamed when their baby dies, and others don't get enough help or sorry when things go wrong. Poor and black moms often face unfair treatment. Health Secretary Wes Streeting says these problems cannot be ignored. Baroness Amos is looking for ways to make care better across the country. She heard stories of moms left alone for hours or bleeding in bathrooms. But she also says many hospitals do a good job. The review will give recommendations to improve care, and a final report will come in the Spring. Families hope this time will bring real change.",
