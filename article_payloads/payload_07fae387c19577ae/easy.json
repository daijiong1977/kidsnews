  "title": "A New Tool to See Inside Cancer",
  "summary": "Scientists in Spain have made a new computer program called RNACOREX to help fight cancer. This tool looks at tiny parts inside our cells, like genes and molecules, to find hidden connections that can cause cancer. It uses data from many cancer patients to create a map that shows how these parts work together. This map helps doctors understand cancer better and predict how patients might survive. RNACOREX is free for everyone to use, so researchers around the world can study cancer more easily. It is like a smart detective that finds clues in our bodies to stop cancer from growing.",

    "Cancer is a sickness where cells in the body grow too fast and can hurt us. Scientists use tools like computers to study cancer and find ways to help people get better. Genes are like instructions in our cells that control how we grow. When genes don't work right, it can cause cancer. New tools help scientists see inside cells to fix problems."
