  "title": "Decoding Oncogenic Networks: RNACOREX as an Explainable AI Platform for Cancer Genomics",
  "summary": "RNACOREX, developed by researchers at the University of Navarra's Institute of Data Science and Artificial Intelligence, is an open-source computational platform designed to elucidate gene regulation networks implicated in cancer survival. This software employs advanced algorithms to analyze high-throughput omics data, focusing on interactions between microRNAs and messenger RNAs within complex regulatory frameworks. By integrating curated biological databases with real-world gene expression data from The Cancer Genome Atlas, RNACOREX ranks biologically significant miRNA-mRNA interactions and constructs probabilistic models that map tumor functionality. Evaluated across thirteen diverse tumor types, including breast and lung carcinomas, the tool demonstrates survival prediction accuracy comparable to sophisticated AI systems while providing transparent, interpretable explanations—addressing the 'black-box' problem in genomics. Beyond prognostication, RNACOREX identifies networks associated with clinical outcomes, detects cross-tumor molecular patterns, and highlights biomedically relevant molecules, thereby facilitating hypothesis generation and target prioritization in oncology research. Funded by initiatives like ANDIA 2021 and ERA PerMed, and accessible via GitHub and PyPI, the platform exemplifies interdisciplinary convergence of biomedicine, AI, and data science, with ongoing expansions planned for pathway analysis and enhanced interaction layers to further unravel tumorigenic mechanisms.",
