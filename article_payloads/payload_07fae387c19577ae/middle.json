  "title": "Unveiling Cancer's Hidden Networks with RNACOREX",
  "summary": "Researchers at the University of Navarra in Spain have developed RNACOREX, an open-source software platform that identifies gene regulation networks associated with cancer survival. This tool analyzes biological molecules like microRNAs and messenger RNAs to detect complex interactions often missed by traditional methods. By integrating data from international databases and The Cancer Genome Atlas, RNACOREX creates interpretable molecular maps that predict patient survival with accuracy comparable to advanced AI models, but with clearer explanations. It has been tested on thirteen tumor types, including breast and lung cancers, and can identify networks linked to clinical outcomes and shared patterns across cancers. As a freely available tool on GitHub, RNACOREX aims to accelerate cancer research by providing reliable insights into tumor biology and potential treatment targets, positioning itself as an explainable alternative to black-box AI systems in genomics.",

    "Cancer is a complex disease caused by genetic mutations and dysregulated cellular processes. Gene regulation involves interactions between molecules like miRNAs and mRNAs that control gene expression; when these networks malfunction, it can lead to tumor growth. The Cancer Genome Atlas is a large-scale effort to catalog genetic changes in cancers, providing valuable data for research. Open-source software allows collaborative development and accessibility in scientific communities. Artificial intelligence is increasingly used in genomics to analyze big data, but interpretability remains a challenge for clinical application."
