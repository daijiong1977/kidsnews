  "title": "Help Count Puffins on a Beautiful Island for Free!",
  "summary": "A wildlife group is looking for volunteers to live on Skomer Island for free. Skomer is a small island in Wales where many birds live. Volunteers will count puffins, which are cute birds with colorful beaks. They are in danger, so counting them helps protect them. The volunteers will stay for a few months in spring, summer, or fall. They get free housing and some money for travel. Last year, over 43,000 puffins were counted on the island, which is a lot! The island also has other birds like Manx shearwaters. This is a fun way to help nature and see amazing wildlife.",
