  "title": "Why Do We Feel Things?",
  "summary": "This article talks about why living things have feelings like happiness and pain. Scientists say consciousness, which is our ability to feel and be aware, has three types. First, basic arousal helps animals stay alive by making them alert to danger, like feeling pain to run away. Second, general alertness lets animals focus on important things, like noticing smoke to find fire, so they can learn. Third, self-consciousness allows animals, including humans and some birds, to think about themselves, recognize their reflection in a mirror, and live in groups. Birds, such as pigeons and crows, show they might feel things too, with brain parts similar to mammals. This helps us understand why consciousness evolved to help animals survive and learn.",

    "Consciousness is a big idea in science about how living things experience the world. It includes feelings like happiness, pain, and awareness. Scientists study it to understand why animals, including humans, evolved to have these experiences. This article explains that consciousness helps animals survive by alerting them to danger, learning new things, and living in groups. Birds are interesting because they might feel things too, even though their brains are different from mammals. Learning about this can help us appreciate how all animals, big and small, might share similar experiences."
