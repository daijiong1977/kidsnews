Players like Brydon Carse and Ben Stokes helped by taking many wickets. The conditions were tough for batting, but England played well.

    "Cricket is a sport played with a bat and ball. The Ashes is a special series between England and Australia that started long ago. A Test match is the longest form of cricket, usually lasting up to five days. In this game, teams take turns batting and bowling. Wickets are important because they get batsmen out. England had not won in Australia for many years, so this win was a big deal for their fans."
