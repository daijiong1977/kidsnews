  "title": "The Life and Legacy of Fashion Designer Paul Costelloe",
  "summary": "Paul Costelloe, a prominent Irish fashion designer, passed away at the age of 80 in London following a brief illness, as announced by his family. Born in Dublin, he studied at the Grafton Academy of Fashion Design and furthered his education in Paris at the Chambre Syndicale de la Haute Couture. In 1979, he established his own label, Paul Costelloe Collections, and gained international recognition by presenting his designs at major fashion weeks in London, Paris, Milan, and New York. A key milestone in his career was his appointment as the personal designer to Diana, Princess of Wales, in 1983, a role he held until her death in 1997. Costelloe was known for incorporating traditional Irish fabrics such as linen and tweed into his work, and he collaborated with retailers like Dunnes Stores. He also faced controversy in 1998 for comments about Irish women's style, though he later noted that Ireland had become more European. Taoiseach Micheál Martin expressed sadness, highlighting Costelloe's role in elevating Irish fashion on the global stage. His death marks the end of an era for fashion enthusiasts.",
