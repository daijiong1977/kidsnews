  "title": "The Life and Legacy of Fashion Designer Paul Costelloe",
  "summary": "Paul Costelloe, a prominent Irish fashion designer, passed away at the age of 80 in London after a short illness, as announced by his family. He was a key figure in British and Irish fashion, renowned for being the personal designer to Diana, Princess of Wales, from 1983 until her death in 1997. Born in Dublin, Costelloe was influenced by his father's raincoat manufacturing business and pursued fashion education at the Grafton Academy in Dublin and the Chambre Syndicale de la Haute Couture in Paris. In 1979, he established Paul Costelloe Collections, presenting his work at major fashion weeks in London, Paris, Milan, and New York. His designs often featured traditional Irish fabrics such as linen and tweed, highlighting his cultural heritage. Costelloe collaborated with retailers like Dunnes Stores and participated in events like Ireland Fashion Week. However, he faced criticism in 1998 for comments about Irish women's style, though he later noted Ireland's evolving European identity in a recent interview. His career demonstrates innovation in fashion while maintaining Irish roots, and his passing marks the end of an era in the fashion world.",
