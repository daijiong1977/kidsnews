  "title": "The Life and Legacy of Fashion Designer Paul Costelloe",
  "summary": "Paul Costelloe, a prominent Irish fashion designer, passed away at the age of 80 in London following a brief illness, as announced by his family. Born in Dublin, he studied at the Grafton Academy of Fashion Design and furthered his education in Paris at the Chambre Syndicale de la Haute Couture. In 1979, he established his own label, Paul Costelloe Collections, and showcased his work at major fashion weeks in London, Paris, Milan, and New York. A significant part of his career was his role as the personal designer to Diana, Princess of Wales, from 1983 until her death in 1997, which greatly boosted his reputation. Costelloe was known for incorporating traditional Irish fabrics such as linen and tweed into his designs and collaborated with retailers like Dunnes Stores. He faced criticism in 1998 for comments about Irish women's style but later noted that Ireland had become more European. The Taoiseach, Micheál Martin, expressed sadness, highlighting Costelloe's role in elevating Irish fashion globally. This article outlines his contributions to fashion and the mixed reactions to his public statements.",
