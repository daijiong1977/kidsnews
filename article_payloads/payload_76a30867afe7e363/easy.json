  "title": "What Are Important Minerals and Why Do We Need Them?",
  "summary": "Countries want special minerals to make things like phones and electric cars. These minerals are called critical minerals because they are very important for a country's safety and economy. China is a big country that helps make these minerals usable for the world. Some minerals, like rare earths, are used in tiny chips that help computers and hospitals work. Even though they are called rare, they are not very rare in the ground. Different countries have different lists of which minerals are important to them. For example, the US says copper is important, but the UK does not. As we use more technology and clean energy, we need more of these minerals.",

    "Critical minerals are special rocks and metals that countries need to make important things like electronics and cars. They are called 'critical' because without them, a country might have trouble keeping its economy strong or staying safe. Some minerals, like rare earths, are used in tiny computer chips that help everything from phones to hospitals work. Even though they sound rare, they are found in the ground in many places. Different countries pick different minerals as critical based on what they have and what they make. As we use more technology and try to use cleaner energy, we need more of these minerals, so countries are trying to get them."
