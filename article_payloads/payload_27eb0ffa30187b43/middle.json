    "The Australian Open is a Grand Slam tennis tournament held annually in Melbourne, attracting top players worldwide. Stan Wawrinka, a Swiss player, has won three Grand Slam titles, including the 2014 Australian Open. Novak Djokovic, from Serbia, is considered one of the greatest tennis players ever, with numerous Grand Slam wins. Marin Cilic, from Croatia, is also a former Grand Slam champion. Tennis matches are scored in sets, with men's matches at Grand Slams potentially going to five sets. The sport requires physical endurance and mental toughness, especially in long matches. Older players like Wawrinka often rely on experience and strategy to compete against younger, faster opponents. Retirement in tennis typically occurs when players decide to end their professional careers, often after decades of competition."
