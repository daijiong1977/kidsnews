  "title": "A Mountain Climbing Accident Goes to Court",
  "summary": "A sad story happened on a big mountain in Austria called Grossglockner. A woman named Kerstin G went climbing with her boyfriend, Thomas P, but she got very cold and died. Now, Thomas is in court because people say he made mistakes that led to her death. Prosecutors think he was the leader of the climb and should have kept her safe. They say he started too late, didn't bring enough emergency gear, and let her wear boots not good for climbing. Thomas says it was just a tragic accident and they both felt ready for the climb. This trial is making people talk about who is responsible when things go wrong in mountain sports. It's a big question about safety and rules.",

    "Mountain climbing is a fun but risky activity where people hike up tall mountains. Sometimes, things go wrong because of bad weather, mistakes, or not having the right gear. In Austria, Grossglockner is the highest mountain, and climbers need to be careful, especially in winter when it's very cold and windy. When accidents happen, people might go to court to figure out if someone is to blame. This story shows how important it is to plan well and keep everyone safe."
