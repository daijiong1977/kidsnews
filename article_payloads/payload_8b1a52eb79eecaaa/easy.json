  "summary": "Sir Cliff Richard, a famous singer, has shared that he had prostate cancer. He is 85 years old and found out about the cancer during a check-up for a tour. The cancer was caught early and had not spread to other parts of his body, so he got treatment and it is gone now. He wants to help other men by encouraging them to get tested for cancer early. He thinks it is important for men to talk about health and not be afraid. Sir Cliff hopes to work with the King to make testing easier for everyone. He believes that early checks can save lives and that the government should listen to people who want better screening.",
