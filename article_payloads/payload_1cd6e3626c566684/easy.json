  "title": "Measles Cases Rise as Fewer Kids Get Vaccines",
  "summary": "Measles is a very contagious disease that was gone from the U.S. for over 25 years, but now it's coming back. In 2023, there were only 63 cases, but by 2025, there were over 2,240 cases, and this year has already seen 416 cases in just three weeks. This increase is happening because fewer children are getting the measles vaccine, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic. Outbreaks are occurring in places like South Carolina and the Utah-Arizona border. Experts like Caitlin Rivers, an epidemiologist, warn that if vaccination rates don't improve, measles could spread more widely across the country. Vaccines are important to protect everyone from getting sick.",

    "Measles is a disease that can make people very sick with fever and a rash. It spreads easily when someone coughs or sneezes. In the past, vaccines helped eliminate measles in the U.S., meaning it was almost gone. But if people stop getting vaccines, the disease can come back and cause outbreaks. Vaccines are safe and protect not just the person who gets them, but also others in the community by stopping the spread of germs."
