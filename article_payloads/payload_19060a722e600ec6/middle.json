  "title": "Draco Malfoy Emerges as Lunar New Year Symbol in China",
  "summary": "In China, Draco Malfoy from the Harry Potter series has unexpectedly become a Lunar New Year mascot due to the auspicious meaning of his Chinese name, Ma-er-fu, which translates to horse and fortune, aligning with the upcoming Year of the Horse. This trend reflects the immense popularity of Harry Potter in China, where the franchise has sold millions of books and films. During Lunar New Year, Chinese households traditionally decorate with couplets and fuzi (red papers with prosperity symbols), and now, some are incorporating images of Draco Malfoy, often hung upside down to symbolize luck's arrival, as the words for upside down and arrival sound similar in Chinese. Social media platforms like Weibo are abuzz with users sharing these decorations and humorous comments, such as references to Felix Felicis, a luck potion from the series. E-commerce sites like Taobao have capitalized on this by selling related stickers and magnets. Actor Tom Felton acknowledged the trend on Instagram, sparking further excitement among fans who use hashtags like Malfoy himself is 100% hilarious. This phenomenon highlights how global pop culture can blend with local traditions, driven by fan enthusiasm and commercial opportunities.",
