  "title": "Raducanu's Comeback Victory After Rain Interruption at Hobart International",
  "summary": "Emma Raducanu secured her first win of the tennis season at the Hobart International, defeating Camila Osorio in straight sets after a rain delay disrupted their match. The British player, ranked 29th in the world, had won the first set 6-3 but was trailing 4-2 in the second set when play was suspended on Tuesday. Upon resuming on Wednesday, Raducanu overturned the deficit to win the second set 7-6 in a tiebreak, expressing relief and joy. This victory marks a positive step in her recovery from injuries that ended her 2025 season early and caused off-season disruptions. Raducanu avoided playing two matches in one day after her next opponent withdrew due to injury, advancing her to the quarter-finals against Taylah Preston. She highlighted the challenges of playing in changing conditions and praised Osorio's performance. The win boosts her preparations for the Australian Open, the first Grand Slam of the year starting in Melbourne, as she aims to regain her top form after setbacks.",
