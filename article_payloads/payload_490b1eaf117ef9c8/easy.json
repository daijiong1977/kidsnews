  "title": "Border Patrol and ICE Leaders Explain Their Work in Minneapolis",
  "summary": "In Minneapolis, leaders from Border Patrol and ICE held a press conference to talk about their work. They said they arrested many people who they believe are dangerous criminals. They defended their methods, like breaking down doors without a warrant, saying it is necessary and legal. However, some people, like Julia Decker from the Immigrant Law Center, are worried because they cannot check if the arrest numbers are correct. Also, federal prosecutors are investigating Minnesota officials to see if they tried to stop the immigration operations. This is a story about how police handle immigration and the disagreements that come with it.",
