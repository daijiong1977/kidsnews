  "title": "Ford's Surprise Tariff Costs and Electric Car Changes",
  "summary": "Ford, a big car company, had to pay $900 million more in tariffs than it thought last year. Tariffs are extra fees on imported parts. The U.S. government changed a program that helps car makers with these fees at the last minute, so Ford got less help. This made Ford's tariff costs double to about $2 billion. Ford also lost money because it changed its plans for electric cars. It stopped making big electric cars because not many people wanted them and rules changed. Instead, Ford will focus on hybrid cars, gas cars, and smaller electric cars. Even with these problems, Ford made more money than experts expected last quarter and hopes to make more profit this year. Its stock price went up a little.",

    "Ford is a car company in the U.S. that makes vehicles like trucks and cars. Tariffs are fees that the government charges when companies bring in parts from other countries. Sometimes, the government has programs to help companies with these fees. Electric cars are a new type of vehicle that use electricity, but not everyone wants them yet. Hybrid cars use both electricity and gas. Companies like Ford try to make money by selling cars, and they sometimes change plans based on what customers want and government rules."
