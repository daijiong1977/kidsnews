  "title": "Planting Trees to Grow a Rainforest",
  "summary": "Volunteers planted 800 young trees to help a special rainforest grow bigger. This rainforest is in Dartmoor, England, at a place called Wistman's Wood. People from groups like Natural England, the Duchy of Cornwall, Moor Trees, and the Woodland Trust worked together on this project. They put fences around the trees to keep them safe from animals. This is part of a long-term plan to restore and expand the rainforest, which is rare and important for nature. The volunteers are happy to help and want to keep planting more trees in the future to make the forest stronger.",

    "Temperate rainforests are special forests found in cool, rainy areas like parts of England. They are home to many plants and animals but are rare because they have been cut down over time. Volunteers and groups work together to plant trees and protect these forests to help nature recover and grow. This project at Wistman's Wood is an example of how people can help restore important habitats for wildlife."
