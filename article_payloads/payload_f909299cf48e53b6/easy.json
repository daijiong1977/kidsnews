  "title": "David Bowie's Surprise Gift for a Village Car Park",
  "summary": "David Bowie was a famous singer who died in 2016. A man named Norman Miller from Binley Woods village in Warwickshire wanted Bowie to play a concert at their village hall to raise money for a car park. He wrote letters to Bowie, but Bowie's son Duncan Jones said no because Bowie was sick. After Bowie died, Jones sent Miller a letter with a joke and a surprise: he gave £10,116 to help pay for the car park. Miller was surprised and thought it might be a trick, but the money was real. Now, the village calls it 'the car park David Bowie paid for.' This story shows how Bowie's family was kind and remembered the letters.",
