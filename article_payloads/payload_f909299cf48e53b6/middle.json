  "title": "David Bowie's Posthumous Donation: A Village Car Park Funded by Letters",
  "summary": "Ten years after David Bowie's death, a lesser-known story involves a donation to Binley Woods village in Warwickshire. Norman Miller, a former committee member of the village hall, sought to raise funds for a car park by inviting Bowie to perform a concert in 2014. Bowie's son, Duncan Jones, declined due to Bowie's health issues, but Miller persisted with letters containing personal stories and jokes. After Bowie died on January 10, 2016, Jones contacted Miller again, thanking him for the jokes that had cheered Bowie and offering £10,116—matching the date of death—towards the car park fund. Initially skeptical, Miller verified the donation through his bank. The money covered the deposit for construction, and the village now affectionately refers to it as 'the car park David Bowie paid for.' This act highlights Bowie's legacy of generosity and the impact of personal connections, even from afar.",
