  "title": "How Scientists Learned About Tiny Air Particles",
  "summary": "Scientists have solved a big mystery about tiny particles in the air we breathe. These particles, like dust and soot, are very small and can make people sick by causing heart problems or cancer. For over 100 years, it was hard to predict how these particles move because they have weird shapes, but scientists used to think they were perfect spheres to make math easier. Now, researchers at the University of Warwick have found a new way to figure out how any shaped particle moves through the air. They used an old idea from 1910 and made it better. This helps us understand air pollution better, which can keep people healthier by improving how we track dirty air in cities or from wildfires.",

    "Air is full of tiny particles that we breathe in every day. These particles come from things like car exhaust, factories, and natural sources like dust. They are so small that you can't see them, but they can go deep into our lungs and make us sick. Scientists study them to keep the air clean and protect our health. For a long time, it was tricky to figure out how these particles move because they have all sorts of shapes, but new research is making it easier."
