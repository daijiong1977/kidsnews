  "title": "How a Missing Nutrient Can Hurt Young Brains",
  "summary": "Scientists found that when young people have obesity, it can harm their brains early on. They discovered that low levels of choline, a nutrient found in foods like eggs and broccoli, are linked to brain cell damage and inflammation. Choline helps keep our brains and livers healthy. The study shows that not getting enough choline might make it easier for obesity to cause problems. Researchers say eating more choline-rich foods can protect the brain as we grow older. This is important because many young people don't get enough choline in their diets.",
