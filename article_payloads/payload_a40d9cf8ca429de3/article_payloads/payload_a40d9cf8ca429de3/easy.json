  "title": "US Government Funding Bill Passes to Stop Shutdown",
  "summary": "The US Senate has passed a funding bill to help end a government shutdown. This bill gives money to the government so it can keep running. Now, the House of Representatives must approve it, and then the president needs to sign it into law. If they do this, the government can reopen, and services like national parks and some offices can start again. This is important because a shutdown means many workers don't get paid and services stop. The bill aims to fix this problem quickly. It's a big step to make sure the government works for everyone.",

    "In the United States, the government needs money to pay for services like parks, schools, and worker salaries. Sometimes, if lawmakers can't agree on a funding plan, the government shuts down, meaning many services stop and workers might not get paid. The Senate and House are parts of Congress that make laws, and the president is the leader who signs laws. This article talks about a bill to give money and end a shutdown, which helps everyone."
