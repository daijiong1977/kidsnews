  "title": "Cynthia Erivo Navigates Criticism in Dracula Stage Adaptation",
  "summary": "Cynthia Erivo, a renowned actress and singer, stars in a minimalist stage adaptation of Dracula at London's Noël Coward Theatre. In this production, she performs solo, portraying 23 characters with 20,000 words of dialogue over two hours, using live technology like cameras to project close-ups onto a screen. During previews, some audience members criticized her for relying on an autocue and learning lines, but Erivo dismisses these comments, emphasizing her commitment to the role and personal growth. She explains that the challenge pushes her as an artist, and she blocks out online negativity to focus on her performance. The adaptation reimagines Bram Stoker's classic vampire tale with Erivo's Nigerian accent and rapid costume changes, blending film and stage elements. Erivo, who has won multiple prestigious awards, sees this role as an opportunity to evolve creatively, highlighting the demanding nature of live theater.",
