  "title": "How Diabetes Hurts Your Heart Over Time",
  "summary": "This article talks about type 2 diabetes, a health condition where your body has trouble using sugar for energy. It explains that people with diabetes have a higher chance of heart problems like heart attacks and strokes, and this risk gets bigger the longer they have diabetes. Scientists did a study to find out why. They discovered that red blood cells, which carry oxygen in your blood, can change over many years of having diabetes and start to damage blood vessels. This damage makes it harder for blood to flow properly. The study also found a special molecule called microRNA-210 in red blood cells that might help doctors check if someone is at risk for heart issues early on. By understanding these changes, doctors could help prevent heart problems in people with diabetes.",

    "Type 2 diabetes is a common health problem where your body doesn't use sugar well, leading to high sugar in your blood. Over time, this can cause issues like heart disease. Red blood cells are important because they move oxygen around your body. Blood vessels are like highways for blood, and if they get damaged, it can cause serious health problems. Scientists study these things to help people stay healthy and prevent diseases."
