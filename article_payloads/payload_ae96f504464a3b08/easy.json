  "title": "A Coal Plant Stays Open: A Story About Energy and Decisions",
  "summary": "In Washington state, a coal power plant was supposed to close and switch to natural gas to reduce pollution, as planned for 15 years. But the Trump administration's Energy Secretary, Chris Wright, said there is an electricity emergency and ordered the plant to keep burning coal for 90 more days. State leaders like Governor Bob Ferguson disagree, saying there is no real emergency and the plant is almost shut down. Meanwhile, Washington is dealing with a real emergency from heavy rain and floods. The article also talks about how the region uses a lot of electricity for things like data centers and electric cars, which might cause future power shortages. People are arguing about whether keeping the coal plant open is the right choice.",

  "background_read": [
    "This article is about a decision to keep a coal power plant open in Washington state. Coal plants burn coal to make electricity, but they can cause air pollution. Many places are switching to cleaner energy like natural gas or renewable sources to help the environment. The Trump administration wanted to support coal, while state leaders in Washington had laws to reduce coal use. The region also faces challenges with growing electricity demand from technology and weather changes. Understanding this helps see why people disagree about energy choices."
