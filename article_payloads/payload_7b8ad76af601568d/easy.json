  "title": "White House Plans to Help People Pay for Health Insurance",
  "summary": "The White House is thinking about a plan to help people pay for health insurance under Obamacare for two more years. Right now, many Americans might have to pay more for health care because the current help is ending soon. This plan would make sure that people who earn up to 700% of the poverty level can get subsidies, which is more than before. Also, everyone might have to pay a small amount each month for their insurance, even if they have low incomes, to stop fraud. President Trump hasn't decided yet, but this shows he might keep part of Obamacare, which was made by President Obama. Democrats wanted this extension, but some Republicans don't like it because they have always wanted to change Obamacare. This is important because it affects how millions of Americans afford doctor visits and medicine.",

    "Obamacare, or the Affordable Care Act, is a law passed in 2010 to help more Americans get health insurance. It includes subsidies, which are financial aids, to make insurance cheaper for people. During the COVID-19 pandemic, extra help was given, and now the government is debating whether to keep it. Health care is important for staying healthy, and debates like this happen in politics to decide how to pay for it."
