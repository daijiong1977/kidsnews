  "title": "The 20-Year Legacy of Glasgow's Pretty Ugly Club Night",
  "summary": "Pretty Ugly is a cult club night in Glasgow that has been operating for two decades, founded by three friends—Aarti Joshi, Pam Scobbie, and Lee Beattie—while they worked at a PR agency with no prior DJ experience. The event is celebrated for its eclectic music mix, spanning from 80s pop to emo rock and power ballads, designed to keep attendees dancing continuously. Over the years, it has attracted notable figures like broadcaster Kirsty Wark and singer Paolo Nutini as guest DJs, and organizers nearly secured Nicola Sturgeon, then Scotland's First Minister, though scheduling issues prevented her appearance. The club's ethos emphasizes a vibrant, inclusive atmosphere, earning a reputation as a safe space that welcomes diverse crowds. With line-up changes, such as Lynne Johnston joining, the core mission has remained consistent: to foster community through music. The anniversary show at King Tut's Wah Wah Hut marks this milestone, highlighting its enduring appeal and cultural impact in Glasgow's nightlife scene.",
