  "title": "Kyrgios's Comeback: ATP Return and Exhibition Match",
  "summary": "Nick Kyrgios is set to make his ATP Tour return at the Brisbane International after a 10-month absence, having received a wildcard entry. Fitness issues have limited him to only five singles matches in 2025, with his last being a second-round loss at the Miami Open. Prior to Brisbane, he will participate in a controversial Battle of the Sexes exhibition match against women's world number one Aryna Sabalenka on December 28, broadcast live on BBC One. This match has sparked debate among fans and experts. Additionally, Kyrgios will compete in the Kooyong Classic warm-up event as he prepares for a potential return to the Australian Open. His world ranking has dropped to 673 due to a series of serious injuries, and without a protected ranking, he requires wildcards for major tournaments. Since 2022, he has played just one Grand Slam match, highlighting the challenges of his comeback journey.",
