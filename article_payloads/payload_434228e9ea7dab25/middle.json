  "title": "Trade Conflicts Impact Golden Dome Missile Defense Plans",
  "summary": "The Golden Dome missile defense shield, led by General Michael Guetlein, aims to deploy a network of space-based sensors and interceptors by 2028 to protect the U.S. from threats like ICBMs, hypersonic weapons, and drones. This aggressive three-year timeline faces challenges from budget and technology issues. Supporters argue it's essential against adversaries such as Russia and China, while critics highlight its high cost and potential to destabilize global security. The Pentagon is advancing with company prototypes and existing investments in sensors and satellites, building on past efforts like Reagan's Strategic Defense Initiative. However, a key obstacle is the need for allied cooperation, particularly from Canada and Denmark, for optimal sensor placement in locations like the Arctic and Greenland. These allies are crucial due to their geographic advantages and NATO membership, but trade wars and tariffs imposed by the Trump administration have limited discussions. Guetlein notes that tariffs have prevented talks, though plans exist to integrate allies later through capabilities or territory access. This tension between defense needs and trade policies creates a one-sided approach, potentially hindering the shield's effectiveness and international relations.",
