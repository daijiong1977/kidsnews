  "title": "The Golden Dome Missile Shield and Trade Problems",
  "summary": "The United States is working on a big project called the Golden Dome missile shield to protect the country from enemy missiles. A general named Michael Guetlein is in charge and wants to finish it by 2028. This shield uses space sensors and interceptors to stop missiles like ICBMs and hypersonic weapons. Supporters say it keeps America safe from countries like Russia and China, but critics worry it costs too much and might cause problems. The project is moving fast with help from companies, but there's a big issue: the U.S. needs help from allies like Canada and Denmark to place sensors in places like the Arctic. However, trade wars and tariffs from President Trump have stopped talks with these allies, making it hard to work together. Guetlein says they plan to include allies later, but for now, the shield is mostly a U.S. effort.",
