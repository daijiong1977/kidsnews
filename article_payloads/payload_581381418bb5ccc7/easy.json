  "title": "Why People Speed in Slow Zones",
  "summary": "This article explains why many drivers break 20mph speed limits. The author got a ticket for speeding in London and took a speed awareness course. They learned that most people were caught driving around 26mph, which is not very fast but still breaks the rule. Many find it hard to drive at 20mph because it feels too slow. Lots of tickets are given for this. Places like Wales and London are making more roads 20mph to keep people safe. Some people argue about this change. The article says it's complicated because of habits and how our brains work. We need to get used to slower speeds for safety.",
