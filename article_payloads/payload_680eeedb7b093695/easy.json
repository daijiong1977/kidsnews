  "title": "Pokémon Stops Game at a Special Shrine After People Got Upset",
  "summary": "Pokémon planned a card game event at a shrine in Japan called Yasukuni Shrine, but they cancelled it because many people in China were angry. The shrine honors Japanese soldiers who died in wars, including some who were war criminals. This made it a sensitive place for countries like China that were hurt by Japan in the past. Pokémon apologized and said they made a mistake by advertising the event on their website. They promised to be more careful in the future. The cancellation happened when relations between China and Japan were already tense over issues like Taiwan. Chinese news sites said brands should respect history and not hurt people's feelings. Pokémon quickly stopped the event to avoid more trouble.",
