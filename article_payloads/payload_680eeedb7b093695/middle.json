  "title": "Pokémon Cancels Event at Yasukuni Shrine Amid China Backlash",
  "summary": "The Pokémon Company cancelled a planned card game event at Tokyo's Yasukuni Shrine after facing significant backlash from China. The event, advertised on Pokémon's official website, was organized by a third party but sparked controversy due to the shrine's history. Yasukuni Shrine commemorates Japanese war dead, including over 1,000 convicted war criminals, making it a sensitive site for nations like China that suffered under Japanese occupation. Pokémon apologized for the lack of due diligence in approving the event and stated it should not have been held. This incident occurred during heightened tensions between China and Japan, partly over Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi's comments on Taiwan. Chinese state media, such as the People's Daily and Global Times, criticized the event as disrespectful to history and an affront to victims, urging brands to take social responsibility. Pokémon responded by cancelling the event promptly and promising to strengthen its approval processes to prevent future issues.",

    "Yasukuni Shrine in Tokyo is a Shinto shrine dedicated to Japanese soldiers who died in conflicts since the Meiji Restoration. It has been controversial since 1978 when Class A war criminals from World War II were enshrined there, leading to protests from countries like China and South Korea that suffered under Japanese imperialism. The Pokémon Company is a Japanese multinational responsible for the Pokémon franchise, which includes video games, trading cards, and media. It often faces scrutiny in international markets due to cultural sensitivities. Relations between China and Japan have been strained over historical issues, territorial disputes, and Taiwan, with recent tensions flaring after comments by Japanese Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi. Chinese state media, such as the People's Daily, often reflects government positions on such matters, emphasizing historical accountability and national pride."
