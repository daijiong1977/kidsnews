  "title": "Ocean Water Getting More Sour Fast",
  "summary": "Scientists have discovered that coastal seas are becoming more acidic much faster than expected. This happens because carbon dioxide from the air dissolves into the ocean, making the water more sour. In places like the California coast, deep ocean water rises and brings extra acidity to the surface, making the problem worse. This acidity can harm sea creatures like fish and corals, which are important for fishing and the environment. Researchers studied old corals to see how acidity has changed over time and used models to predict future changes. They warn that this could affect fisheries and people who depend on the ocean. The study suggests that reducing carbon dioxide pollution can help protect the ocean.",

    "Ocean acidification is when the ocean becomes more sour because of carbon dioxide from human activities like burning fossil fuels. This can hurt marine life, such as shellfish and corals, by making it hard for them to build their shells and skeletons. Coastal areas are especially affected because upwelling brings acidic water from the deep ocean to the surface, making the problem worse. Understanding this helps us protect the ocean and the animals that live there."
