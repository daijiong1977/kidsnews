  "title": "How Our Brain Keeps Some Memories Forever",
  "summary": "Our brain helps us remember important things like fun times or scary moments. Scientists studied mice in a virtual reality game to learn how memories last. They found that the brain has special parts that decide which memories to keep for a long time. For example, the hippocampus is for short-term memory, and the cortex stores long-term memories. A scientist named Priya Rajasethupathy says memories can change over time, not just turn on and off. This helps us understand why we remember some things forever and forget others quickly. It's like the brain has a timer for memories!",

    "Memories are the things we remember from our lives, like birthdays or learning to ride a bike. Scientists study how the brain works to understand why we keep some memories for a long time and forget others. The brain has different parts, such as the hippocampus for new memories and the cortex for old ones. In this study, researchers used virtual reality with mice to see how memories form and last. This helps us learn about our own memories and could lead to better ways to help people with memory problems."
