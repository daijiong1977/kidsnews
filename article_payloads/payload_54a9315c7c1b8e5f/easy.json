  "title": "Exploring the Kuiper Belt: A Faraway Space Zone",
  "summary": "The Kuiper Belt is a faraway area in space beyond Neptune, filled with icy objects like Pluto. Astronomers are using new telescopes to learn more about it. They have found about 4,000 objects so far, but expect to find many more soon. The Vera C. Rubin Observatory in Chile is a special telescope that started working last year to help map this region. Scientists hope to discover if there are hidden planets or clues about how our solar system formed long ago. The Kuiper Belt is like a time capsule from the early solar system, holding frozen relics that can tell us stories about the past. By studying it, astronomers can fill in gaps in our knowledge and answer big questions about space.",

    "The Kuiper Belt is a distant part of our solar system, beyond the planet Neptune. It is filled with icy objects like comets and dwarf planets, such as Pluto. Astronomers use telescopes to observe this area because it holds clues about how our solar system formed billions of years ago. New telescopes, like the Vera C. Rubin Observatory, are making it easier to see these faraway objects and discover new ones. This helps scientists understand more about space and maybe find hidden planets."
