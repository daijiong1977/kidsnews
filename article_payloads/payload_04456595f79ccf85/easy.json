  "title": "AI Helps Find Cancer but Also Learns About People",
  "summary": "Doctors use microscopes to look at tiny pieces of tissue to find cancer. This helps them know what type of cancer a person has and how to treat it. Now, artificial intelligence (AI) is being used to help with this job. AI is a computer system that can learn from pictures. In a new study, scientists found that AI can guess details about patients, like their race, gender, and age, just by looking at the tissue slides. This is surprising because human doctors cannot do this. The problem is that the AI does not work equally well for all people. For example, it might make more mistakes in finding lung cancer in African American patients or breast cancer in younger patients. This is called bias, and it can lead to wrong diagnoses. To fix this, the researchers created a tool called FAIR-Path to make the AI fairer. They tested it and found it helps reduce bias. This is important because AI is used in hospitals to help doctors, and we want it to be accurate for everyone.",

    "Cancer is a disease where cells in the body grow too fast and can make people sick. Doctors use tools like microscopes to see tiny parts of the body called tissue. AI is a new technology that helps computers learn from pictures, like how you learn from books. In medicine, AI can help find diseases faster. But sometimes, AI might not work the same for everyone, which is called bias. Scientists are working to make AI fair so it can help all patients equally."
