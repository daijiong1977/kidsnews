  "title": "AI in Pathology: Detecting Cancer and Demographic Bias",
  "summary": "Pathology is a medical field where experts examine tissue samples under microscopes to diagnose cancer, determining its type and stage. Traditionally, this process is objective, with pathologists focusing solely on disease indicators without knowing patient identities. However, the integration of artificial intelligence (AI) into pathology labs has revealed unexpected challenges. A study led by Harvard Medical School researchers shows that AI models, designed to identify cancer from tissue slides, can infer demographic details such as race, gender, and age from the images. This ability introduces bias, as the AI's diagnostic accuracy varies across different patient groups. For instance, the models performed less accurately in distinguishing lung cancer subtypes for African American and male patients, and in classifying breast cancer subtypes for younger patients. These disparities occurred in about 29% of diagnostic tasks analyzed. The bias arises because AI extracts demographic patterns from tissue and uses them in decision-making, contrary to the assumption that pathology is purely objective. To address this, the researchers developed FAIR-Path, a framework that significantly reduced bias in tested models. This work highlights the importance of fairness in medical AI, as biased systems can impact diagnostic outcomes and patient care. The study, supported by federal funding, was published in Cell Reports Medicine, emphasizing the need for ongoing evaluation and improvement of AI tools in healthcare.",

    "Pathology involves analyzing tissue samples to diagnose diseases like cancer, relying on visual cues under microscopes. Artificial intelligence (AI) uses machine learning to automate tasks, such as image recognition, by training on large datasets. In healthcare, AI aids in diagnostics but can inherit biases from training data, leading to unequal outcomes. Demographic factors like race and gender influence health disparities, and AI systems may inadvertently perpetuate these if not properly designed. The FAIR-Path framework represents an effort to mitigate bias, ensuring AI tools are equitable. This context is crucial for understanding how technology impacts medical fairness and patient safety."
