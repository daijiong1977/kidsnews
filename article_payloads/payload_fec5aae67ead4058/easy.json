  "title": "President Trump's Health Check and Other News",
  "summary": "This article talks about three main news stories from Monday. First, the White House said President Trump had an MRI scan to check his heart and belly, and his doctor said everything looks normal. This was part of his yearly health check, even though he already had one earlier. Second, a court ruled that a lawyer named Alina Habba should not be working as a U.S. attorney in New Jersey because she wasn't properly chosen for the job. This is a big problem for the Trump administration. Third, a soldier from West Virginia who was shot in Washington last week is getting better but is still very sick. The article shares updates on these events to keep people informed.",
