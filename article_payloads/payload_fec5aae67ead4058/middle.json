  "title": "Trump's MRI Screening and Legal Challenges in the News",
  "summary": "This article summarizes three key news stories from a Monday report. First, the White House clarified that President Trump underwent an MRI as a preventative screening focused on his heart and abdomen, with his physician stating the results were 'perfectly normal.' This occurred during a routine checkup at Walter Reed Medical Center in October, despite Trump having already completed his annual physical in April, raising questions about the timing and necessity. Second, a federal appeals court ruled that Alina Habba, a former personal attorney for Trump, has been serving unlawfully as the U.S. attorney in New Jersey because she wasn't confirmed by the Senate or appointed by judges, challenging the administration's appointment practices. This decision could lead to a Supreme Court case. Third, a West Virginia National Guard member shot in a targeted attack in Washington is showing positive signs in recovery but remains in serious condition, highlighting ongoing concerns about safety. The article aims to update readers on these developments, blending health, legal, and human interest elements.",
