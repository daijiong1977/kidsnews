  "title": "Plants Borrow Genes from Bacteria to Make Medicine",
  "summary": "Plants make special chemicals called alkaloids to protect themselves, and people use these chemicals for medicines like pain relief. Scientists studied a plant called Flueggea suffruticosa that makes an alkaloid named securinine. They found that the gene that helps make securinine looks like genes from bacteria, not plants. This means plants might use tools from tiny microbes to create their protective chemicals. This discovery could help scientists make medicines faster and cheaper in labs, without harming the environment. It might also help grow stronger crops. The research was done at the University of York and published in a science journal.",

    "Plants are living things that make chemicals to stay safe from bugs and diseases. People have used these plant chemicals for a long time to make medicines, like aspirin from willow trees. Scientists study how plants make these chemicals to create new drugs. In this article, they found that a plant uses a gene similar to bacteria to make a chemical called securinine. This is surprising because plants and bacteria are very different. Learning this helps scientists make medicines in labs without hurting the environment and might help farmers grow better crops."
