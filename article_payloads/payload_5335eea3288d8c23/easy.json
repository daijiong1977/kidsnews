  "title": "A Glove Mystery Near Savannah Guthrie's Mom's House",
  "summary": "A glove with DNA was found near the home of Savannah Guthrie's mom, Nancy Guthrie, who is missing. The FBI says the glove might match gloves worn by a masked person seen on video outside her door. Nancy, who is 84 years old, disappeared from her Arizona home, and her blood was found on the porch. Police are looking for clues, like a backpack and a car, but no one has been arrested yet. They are worried because Nancy needs medicine for her heart. Many gloves were found nearby, but most were from people searching for her.",
