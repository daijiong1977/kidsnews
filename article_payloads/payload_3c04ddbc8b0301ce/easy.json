  "title": "Stars That Flash Together: Finding Hidden Partners in Space",
  "summary": "Astronomers have discovered that some fast radio bursts, or FRBs, come from pairs of stars orbiting each other, not just single stars. FRBs are very bright flashes of radio waves that last only a tiny moment and come from faraway galaxies. Using a big telescope called FAST in China, scientists watched a repeating FRB for many months. They saw a special signal called an RM flare, which showed a sudden change in the radio waves. This signal was likely caused by a burst of material from a companion star, like our Sun, near the FRB source. The finding helps explain that some FRBs are made in binary systems, where a magnetar, a star with a strong magnetic field, and another star work together. This discovery changes what we thought about where these mysterious signals come from and makes studying them more exciting.",

    "Fast radio bursts are mysterious signals from space that scientists are trying to understand. They are very powerful but last only milliseconds. Astronomers use big telescopes like FAST to study them. Stars can be alone or in pairs called binary systems. This discovery shows that some FRBs come from these pairs, which helps us learn more about how stars work and what happens in distant galaxies."
