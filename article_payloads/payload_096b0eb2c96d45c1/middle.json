  "title": "Brigitte Bardot: From Cinema Icon to Animal Advocate",
  "summary": "Brigitte Bardot, a French cinema actress who died at 91, was a transformative figure in 1950s film, symbolizing sexual liberation and becoming a national icon known as 'BB'. She starred in nearly 50 films, most notably And God Created Woman, which challenged societal norms and sparked controversy in the US while being praised by intellectuals like Simone de Beauvoir. In 1973, she retired from acting to dedicate herself to animal welfare, founding the Brigitte Bardot Foundation. French President Emmanuel Macron mourned her as a 'legend of the century', highlighting her impact on French culture and her advocacy for animals. However, her later years were marred by homophobic and racially charged remarks, leading to fines and damaging her public image. Born in Paris in 1934 to a wealthy family, she rose to fame after appearing on Elle magazine's cover and quickly became a sensation. Her personal life included marriages to director Roger Vadim and later to Bernard d'Ormale, a far-right political adviser. The article explores her dual legacy as a cinematic pioneer and a controversial figure in her later activism.",
