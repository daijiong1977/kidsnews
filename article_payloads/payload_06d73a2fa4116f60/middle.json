  "summary": "Carlos Alcaraz secured a decisive win at the Qatar Open in Doha, defeating Arthur Fils in just 50 minutes with a score of 6-2 6-1. This victory marks his 12th win of the 2026 season and his 26th career title, following his recent Australian Open triumph. Alcaraz demonstrated exceptional skill, converting five out of seven break points and hitting 18 winners without conceding a break point. He broke Fils' serve early, setting the tone for a match where Fils showed frustration by smashing his racquet. Alcaraz attributed his success to mental strength and teamwork, expressing hunger for more achievements. This win is notable as it surpasses last year's shortest final time and comes after Alcaraz's historic Career Grand Slam completion. Fils, ranked world number 40, humorously praised Alcaraz's performance despite the loss.",
