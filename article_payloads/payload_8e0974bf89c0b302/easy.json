One is called Making Life on Earth: Attenborough's Greatest Adventure, which shows how they made an old series from 1979 where David traveled to many countries to film animals. Another is Secret Garden, where David explores gardens in Britain to find hidden wildlife. The last is David Attenborough's 100 Years on Planet Earth, a live event with music and guests. The week will also include old favorite shows like Planet Earth and Blue Planet. The BBC says David's shows help people learn about nature and care for the planet. This is a fun way to say thank you to David for his amazing work.",
