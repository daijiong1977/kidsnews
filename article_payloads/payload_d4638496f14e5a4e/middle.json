  "background_read": [
    "The Gaza Strip is a densely populated area with a history of conflict between Hamas and Israel, involving issues like borders, security, and humanitarian crises. Peace deals often require concessions from both sides, such as disarmament. Venezuela faces political and economic turmoil, with the U.S. imposing sanctions and conducting anti-drug operations due to concerns over narcotics trafficking. International diplomacy involves complex interactions between leaders, as seen with Trump's engagements with Putin and actions in the Caribbean. Understanding these contexts helps grasp the challenges in achieving peace and combating illegal activities globally."
