  "title": "Colombia's President Stands Up to Trump's Words",
  "summary": "In South America, Colombia is a country next to Venezuela. The United States and Colombia are usually friends, but President Trump from the U.S. has said mean things about Colombia's President Gustavo Petro. Trump says Petro is involved with drugs, but there is no proof. Petro used to be a fighter in a group called M-19, but he stopped fighting in the 1990s. Now, Petro says he will protect Colombia if it is attacked. Many people in Colombia think Trump is being unfair and trying to control their country. They believe every country should make its own decisions without interference. This situation is making things tense between the two countries.",
