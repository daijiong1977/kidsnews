  "title": "Rocket News: New Rockets and Satellites in Space",
  "summary": "This article talks about exciting space news from around the world. In 2025, new rockets like Blue Origin's New Glenn and China's Zhuque-3 flew for the first time, with some trying to land back on Earth. Rocket Lab launched small satellites for NASA and the Space Force to test a new flat-shaped satellite called DiskSat, which is like a pizza and can be stacked. SpaceX warned about a close call between a Chinese satellite and a Starlink satellite in space, saying they need better coordination. A South Korean company, Innospace, is getting ready to launch its small rocket from Brazil to send tiny satellites into space. The article shares updates on rockets, satellites, and safety in space.",

    "Space is where rockets and satellites go to help us with things like TV, weather, and science. Companies from different countries build rockets to launch satellites into orbit around Earth. Sometimes, rockets can be reused by landing back safely. Satellites come in different shapes and sizes to do jobs in space. It's important for countries to work together to keep space safe and avoid crashes."
