  "title": "Turning Thyme into Tiny Medicine Drops",
  "summary": "Scientists are making thyme, a plant used in cooking and natural remedies, into tiny medicine drops. Thyme has good stuff like thymol that helps fight germs and reduce swelling, but it can evaporate quickly and irritate the body. To fix this, researchers from Russia found a way to put very small droplets of thyme extract inside another liquid. They use a special chip to mix thyme with gelatin and sodium alginate, then add oil to break it into tiny drops. This keeps the thyme from evaporating and allows it to be given in small, safe doses. The scientists say this method can be used for other substances too and might help make medicines more precise. They are working on making it even better with technology like AI.",

    "Thyme is a common herb used in cooking and traditional medicine. It contains compounds like thymol that have health benefits, such as fighting infections and reducing inflammation. However, using it as medicine can be tricky because it evaporates easily and might cause irritation. Scientists are working on new ways to deliver thyme in small, controlled amounts to make it safer and more effective. This involves creating tiny droplets encapsulated in liquids, a process that could improve how medicines are made and given."
