  "title": "Microfluidic Encapsulation of Thyme Extract for Enhanced Nanodosing in Precision Therapeutics",
  "summary": "This article explores a novel microfluidic encapsulation technique developed to transform thyme extract into precise nanodoses, addressing significant limitations in its pharmaceutical application. Thyme extract is rich in bioactive compounds, including thymol, carvacrol, rosmarinic acid, and caffeic acid, which confer anti-inflammatory, antimicrobial, and antioxidant properties. However, practical challenges such as rapid evaporation and potential irritation at higher concentrations impede its utility in medicine. Researchers from Tomsk Polytechnic University and Surgut State University engineered a method utilizing a microfluidic chip to encapsulate thyme extract within gelatin and sodium alginate matrices, with oil-induced droplet formation ensuring minimal evaporation and controlled release. Published in Physics of Fluids, the study demonstrates that this approach facilitates self-regulating, consistent nanodosing, adjustable through modulation of oil phase flow rates. The implications extend beyond thyme, as the technique is adaptable to other aqueous extracts and holds promise for sectors like food technology. Future directions involve integrating machine vision and artificial intelligence for real-time monitoring, and ongoing work focuses on encapsulating more concentrated water-alcohol extracts. This research underscores the convergence of nanotechnology, fluid dynamics, and biotechnology in advancing personalized medicine.",
