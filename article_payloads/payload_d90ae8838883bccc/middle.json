  "title": "Sinner's Victory in Extreme Heat at Australian Open",
  "summary": "Jannik Sinner, an Italian tennis player, faced a challenging third-round match at the 2024-2025 Australian Open in Melbourne, where temperatures soared near 40°C. He was struggling with cramps and on the verge of defeat against American Eliot Spizzirri. However, the tournament's heat rule was invoked, pausing play and allowing the roof to be closed on the show court. This intervention provided Sinner with cooler conditions, enabling him to recover and ultimately win the match 4-6, 6-3, 6-4, 6-4. He acknowledged his luck, as the heat rule saved him from a potential upset. The extreme heat affected the entire event, with play suspended on outside courts until evening, and measures like mist tunnels and water machines were used to protect spectators. Ball kids avoided burning their hands by placing them on their feet instead of the hot court. The heat rule is triggered when the heat stress scale reaches its maximum, considering factors like radiant heat and humidity, ensuring player and fan safety in brutal conditions.",
