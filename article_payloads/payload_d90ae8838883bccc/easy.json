  "title": "Jannik Sinner Wins Tennis Match in Hot Weather",
  "summary": "Jannik Sinner is a tennis player who won a big match at the Australian Open in Melbourne. It was very hot, almost 40 degrees Celsius, and he was having trouble with cramps. The heat rule helped him because it stopped the game so he could cool down under a roof. This saved him from losing to another player. Many fans were at the match, and they used mist tunnels and water to stay cool. Ball kids had to be careful not to burn their hands on the hot court. The heat rule is used when it gets too hot to play safely. Sinner said he was lucky because of this rule.",
