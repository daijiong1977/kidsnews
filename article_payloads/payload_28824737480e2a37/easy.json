  "title": "Many Americans Are Unhappy with How the President Handles Money Issues",
  "summary": "A new poll shows that many Americans are not happy with how President Trump is handling the economy, which is about money and jobs. Fifty-seven percent of people disapprove, and only thirty-six percent think he is doing a good job, which is the lowest ever in this poll. People are worried about the cost of living, like prices for food and housing, and healthcare costs. Seven in ten Americans say living in their area is too expensive. This unhappiness might affect how people vote in future elections. Experts say when people feel money is tight, they blame the president. The poll also found that more voters now trust the Democratic party to handle the economy better than the Republican party, which is a big change from before.",

    "This article talks about a poll that asks Americans how they feel about President Trump's job with the economy. The economy includes things like prices, jobs, and how much money people have. Many people are unhappy because they find it hard to afford basic needs like food and housing. This can influence who they vote for in elections, as they might choose a different leader or party they think will do better. Polls help us understand what many people think by asking questions to a group of Americans."
