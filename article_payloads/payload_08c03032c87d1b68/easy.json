  "title": "Scientists Find a Way to Help Brains with Dementia",
  "summary": "Scientists at the University of Vermont have found a new way to help people with dementia. Dementia is a brain problem that makes it hard to remember things and think clearly. It affects millions of people around the world. The scientists discovered that a missing substance called PIP2 in the blood can cause poor blood flow in the brain. Blood flow is important because it brings oxygen and nutrients to brain cells. When PIP2 is low, a protein called Piezo1 becomes too active and messes up the blood flow. By adding PIP2 back, the scientists could fix the blood flow in tests. This could lead to new treatments to help people with dementia feel better and think better. The research is still in early stages, but it gives hope for future medicines.",

    "Dementia is a condition where the brain doesn't work well, often seen in older people. It can make it hard to remember names, places, or do everyday tasks. Blood flow in the brain is like a delivery system that brings food and air to brain cells. Scientists study how things like proteins and substances in the blood affect this flow to find ways to help people with brain problems."
