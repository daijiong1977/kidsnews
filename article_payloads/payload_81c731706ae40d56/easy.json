  "title": "How Team GB Wins Gold in Skeleton Without an Ice Track",
  "summary": "Team GB is very good at skeleton, a winter sport where athletes slide down an ice track on a sled. They have won many medals, even though Britain doesn't have its own ice track. Athletes like Matt Weston, Amy Williams, and Lizzy Yarnold have won gold. They practice on a short push track at the University of Bath, using a small wooden hut. They focus on their starts and training hard. Lizzy Yarnold says their superpower is using practice time wisely. A man named Kristan Bromley helped by designing sleds. This shows that with hard work and smart thinking, you can succeed without having everything others do.",

    "Skeleton is a fast winter sport where athletes slide head-first on a sled down an icy track. It started in the 1800s and is now in the Winter Olympics. Team GB has been successful by training hard and using smart strategies, even without their own ice track. They practice on a push track to improve their starts, which is important for going fast. This story shows how determination and teamwork can lead to winning medals."
