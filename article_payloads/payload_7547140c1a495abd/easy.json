At night, more rain, snow, and ice will come, especially in Scotland and northern England. This could make travel tricky on Sunday morning. The government has warned that the cold weather might affect health services and people who are vulnerable. People are taking pictures of the weather, like sunny Cornwall and snowy High Peak. The article asks if winters will keep being wet and cause flooding.",
