  "title": "Earth Sends Tiny Pieces to the Moon",
  "summary": "Scientists have discovered that Earth has been sending tiny bits of its air to the moon for billions of years. They thought Earth's magnetic field would stop this, but it actually helps. The sun's wind pushes particles from Earth's atmosphere, and Earth's magnetic field guides them to the moon. This happens very slowly over a long time. The moon's soil has collected these particles, which include things like water and nitrogen. This means the moon might have a record of Earth's past air and could help astronauts in the future by providing resources. Researchers used computer simulations to understand this process better.",
