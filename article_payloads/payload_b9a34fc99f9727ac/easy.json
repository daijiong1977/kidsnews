The Christmas Special will air on BBC One, where six couples will dance under the glitterball. In October, they surprised fans by saying they would leave after this series. People are now guessing who might replace them, with names like Zoe Ball and Rylan being mentioned. Tess started on the show 21 years ago, and Claudia joined in 2014.
