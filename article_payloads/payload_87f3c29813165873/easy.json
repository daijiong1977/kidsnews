  "title": "Judge Says No to Stopping Immigration Police in Minnesota",
  "summary": "A federal judge in Minnesota decided not to stop a big increase in immigration police actions while a court case is happening. The judge, Katherine Menendez, said no to a request from state and city leaders to pause the police surge. These leaders, including the state attorney general and mayors, think the federal government is breaking the rules by sending more police to catch immigrants. They say it's hurting schools and businesses. But the federal government says it needs to do this to remove criminals from the streets. The judge looked at both sides and felt it wasn't clear who was right, so she didn't stop the police actions. She also mentioned that another court recently ruled in favor of the government in a similar case. This means the immigration police will keep working in Minnesota for now as the lawsuit continues.",

    "In the United States, immigration is when people come from other countries to live here. Sometimes, the federal government sends police to enforce immigration laws, which can lead to arguments with state and local leaders. A lawsuit is a way for people to ask a court to decide if something is fair or legal. Judges listen to both sides and make decisions based on the law. In Minnesota, there is a big increase in police actions to catch immigrants, and leaders are worried it might be too harsh or against the rules. This article talks about a judge who decided not to stop these actions while the court case is still going on."
