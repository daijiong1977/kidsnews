  "title": "Staying Up Late Can Hurt Your Heart",
  "summary": "A new study found that people who stay up late, called night owls, might have more heart problems than those who go to bed early, called early birds. The research looked at over 300,000 adults in the UK. It showed that night owls were 79% more likely to have poor heart health and 16% more likely to have a heart attack or stroke. Women who are night owls seemed to be at higher risk than men. The study says that bad habits like smoking and not getting enough sleep might cause these heart issues. Going to bed early can help keep your heart healthy.",
