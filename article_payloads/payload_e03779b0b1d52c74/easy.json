  "title": "Royal Mail Bosses to Explain Letter Delivery Problems to Parliament",
  "summary": "Royal Mail bosses will go to Parliament to talk about problems with delivering letters. The BBC found out that many people are upset because their letters arrive late. Some people missed hospital appointments or did not get important papers like school certificates. Postal workers say they are too busy and sometimes focus more on parcels than letters. A group in Parliament called the Business and Trade Committee asked Royal Mail to explain these issues. Royal Mail says it wants to talk about how it is changing to fix the problems. The company was bought by a billionaire last year, and he promised to care for workers and customers. But now, even first-class mail is often late. Royal Mail blames bad weather and sick workers for some delays, but many people are still unhappy.",
