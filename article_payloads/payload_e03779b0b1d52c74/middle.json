  "title": "Royal Mail Executives Summoned to Parliament Over Letter Delivery Failures",
  "summary": "Royal Mail executives are being called to Parliament by the Business and Trade Committee to address significant failures in letter delivery services. The BBC reported that parcels are being prioritized over letters, leading to delays in time-sensitive mail such as hospital appointment letters, school certificates, and bank statements. Hundreds of people have expressed frustration to the BBC, citing missed appointments and undelivered important documents. Postal staff from various offices claim that delivery rounds are missed daily due to overcapacity, with parcels taking precedence. The committee, chaired by Liam Byrne, gave Royal Mail two weeks to respond to these allegations and commit to improvements, but due to ongoing poor service, bosses are now required to answer directly to MPs. Royal Mail, recently acquired by Czech billionaire Daniel Kretinsky's EP Group, states that attending the committee will allow discussion of transformation efforts and the need to modify the Universal Service Obligation for sustainability. However, Byrne notes that even first-class deliveries are off track, raising concerns about compliance with legal undertakings post-takeover. Royal Mail attributes some disruptions to weather and staff sickness, but the committee seeks accountability and solutions to restore reliable mail services.",

  "background_read": [
    "Royal Mail is the UK's primary postal service, established centuries ago and privatized in 2013. It operates under a Universal Service Obligation (USO), which mandates delivery of letters and parcels to all addresses at uniform prices. The Business and Trade Committee is a select committee in the UK Parliament that examines government departments and public bodies related to business, trade, and industrial strategy. Recent acquisition by EP Group, led by Daniel Kretinsky, has raised questions about service commitments amid modernization efforts. This context helps understand the pressures on Royal Mail to balance financial sustainability with reliable service delivery."
