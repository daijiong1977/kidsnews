  "title": "Using Brain Waves to Help People Move Again",
  "summary": "Some people get hurt in their spine and can't move their arms or legs, even though their brain and limbs are okay. The problem is that the signals from the brain can't get through the damaged spine. Scientists are trying to help by using a special cap called EEG that reads brain waves. When a person thinks about moving, their brain makes signals. The EEG cap can pick up these signals and send them to a device that makes the limbs move. This is safer than putting things inside the brain. The scientists tested it with people trying to move, and they used a computer program to understand the signals better. It works better for arms than legs because leg signals are deeper in the brain. This research could help paralyzed patients move without surgery.",

    "When someone has a spinal cord injury, it's like a roadblock that stops messages from the brain to the arms or legs. The brain still wants to move, but the signals can't get through. Scientists are exploring ways to fix this without dangerous surgery. They use an EEG cap, which is like a special helmet that listens to brain waves. By understanding these signals, they hope to create devices that can make limbs move again, giving hope to people who are paralyzed. This research is important because it could improve lives without needing operations inside the body."
