  "title": "Prices Go Down, Inflation Drops",
  "summary": "In November, prices for things like food, clothes, and drinks went down, which helped lower inflation in the UK. Inflation is a measure of how much prices are rising overall. It fell to 3.2%, which is lower than before and surprised experts. Food prices dropped, especially for cakes, biscuits, and cereals. This is good news because it means things might get cheaper for families. The Bank of England might lower interest rates soon, which could help people save money. However, some prices, like for beef and chocolate, are still going up. The government is working to reduce bills, like for trains and energy, to help everyone.",

    "Inflation is like a speedometer for prices in a country. When it goes up, things cost more over time, which can make it hard for people to buy what they need. In the UK, experts track prices of many items, like food and clothes, to calculate inflation. Sometimes, prices drop, which can lower inflation and help families save money. The Bank of England uses interest rates to control inflation, and the government makes policies to reduce costs for everyone."
