  "summary": "Scientists studied golden retrievers to learn about genes that affect behavior. They found genes in dogs that are similar to genes in humans. These genes can influence how dogs and people act, but the behaviors might be different. For example, a gene linked to fear in dogs could be linked to anxiety in humans. The study used surveys from dog owners and blood samples to look at the dogs' DNA. This helps us understand how genes work in both dogs and people, even if the exact behaviors are not the same. It shows that genes are important for behavior in many animals.",

    "Genes are like instructions in our bodies that come from our parents. They help decide how we look and act. Dogs have genes too, and scientists study them to understand behavior. Golden retrievers are a breed of dog known for being friendly. By looking at their genes, researchers can see if the same genes affect how people feel and behave, such as being happy or scared. This study shows that genes are shared across animals, but other things like where you live can change how you act."
