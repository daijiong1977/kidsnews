  "title": "Royal Mail Faces Delivery Delays as Parcels Take Priority",
  "summary": "Royal Mail, the UK's postal service, is experiencing significant delivery issues according to reports from postal staff and customers. More than a dozen workers from various delivery offices have disclosed that daily rounds are being missed, with parcels consistently prioritized over letters due to capacity strains. This has resulted in letters remaining undelivered in depots for weeks, causing widespread frustration. Hundreds of individuals have contacted BBC Your Voice to report problems such as missed hospital appointments, lost school certificates, and delayed bank statements, highlighting the real-world impacts. Postal workers attribute the delays to insufficient resources, including a shortage of vans, and pressure to focus on parcels because they generate more revenue for the company. While Royal Mail asserts that the majority of mail is delivered as planned and acknowledges customer concerns, many employees describe the situation as a crisis, with over 20 workers confirming delays and parcel prioritization in their offices. The issue is exacerbated by legal requirements for daily letter delivery, though some offices are testing slower targets.",
