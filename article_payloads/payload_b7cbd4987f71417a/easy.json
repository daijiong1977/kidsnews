  "title": "Royal Mail Has Trouble Delivering Letters",
  "summary": "Royal Mail is a company that delivers mail in the UK. Some postal workers say they are very busy and cannot deliver all the letters on time. They often focus on delivering parcels first because parcels make more money for the company. This means letters can sit in depots for weeks without being delivered. People are upset because they miss important things like hospital appointments or school certificates when letters arrive late. Royal Mail says most mail is delivered as planned, but many workers and customers disagree. The workers feel stretched and say there are not enough vans to do all the work. This problem affects many people across the UK.",
