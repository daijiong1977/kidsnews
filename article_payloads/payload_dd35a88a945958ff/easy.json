  "title": "Coast Guard Changes Rules on Hate Symbols",
  "summary": "The U.S. Coast Guard is a group that helps keep people safe on the water. They made a new rule about hate symbols like swastikas and nooses. At first, they planned to call these symbols 'potentially divisive,' which means they might cause arguments. But many people, including leaders and supporters, got upset and said this was not strong enough. So, the Coast Guard quickly changed the rule to be firmer against hate symbols. This shows that when people speak up, organizations can listen and make things better. It's important to stand against hate to keep everyone safe and respected.",

    "The Coast Guard is part of the U.S. government and helps with safety on oceans and rivers. Hate symbols like swastikas and nooses have been used to hurt people based on race or religion. When organizations use weak words for these symbols, it can make people feel unsafe. Speaking up can lead to better rules that protect everyone."
