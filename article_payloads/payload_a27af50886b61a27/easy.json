  "title": "A Famous View Blocked by New Buildings",
  "summary": "A new building is being built in St Ives, Cornwall, that will block a sea view from a house where Virginia Woolf, a famous writer, used to stay as a child. This view inspired her to write books like 'To the Lighthouse'. People who love her books are upset because they think the view is important to remember her. The building company says the plan is similar to what was approved in 2009. The house is called Talland House, and the view looks out to a lighthouse. Some locals and experts want to save the view because it is part of history and culture.",

    "Virginia Woolf was a famous writer who lived a long time ago. She wrote many books that people still read today. When she was a child, she spent summers in a house called Talland House in St Ives, Cornwall. From this house, she could see a beautiful view of the sea and a lighthouse. This view inspired her to write stories. Now, a new building is being built in front of the house, which will block this view. Some people are angry because they think the view is important for remembering Virginia Woolf and her books. The building company says they have permission to build, but others want to save the view."
