  "title": "Robbie Williams Beats The Beatles in Album Chart Record",
  "summary": "Robbie Williams has broken a big record in the UK music charts. He now has more number one albums than The Beatles, a famous band from the past. His new album called Britpop is his 16th number one album since he started his solo career in 1997. Robbie is very happy and surprised by this achievement. He says it feels amazing and compares his success to stretching an elastic band very far. He is celebrating with his wife in Paris by having a Coke Zero and a salad. Robbie also talks about his past struggles with mental health and addiction, but now he feels better and grateful. The album Britpop looks back at his early solo days and celebrates 1990s British music. Other musicians like Gaz Coombes and Gary Barlow helped on the album, and people are giving it good reviews.",
