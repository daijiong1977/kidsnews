  "title": "Young Dylan Thomas Copied Poems in School",
  "summary": "Dylan Thomas was a famous poet from Wales. When he was a boy in school, he copied poems from other poets and put his own name on them. A man named Alessandro Gallenzi found this out while working on a new book of Thomas's poems. Thomas went to Swansea Grammar School and wrote for the school magazine. Gallenzi discovered that at least 12 poems Thomas published in the magazine were actually written by other people. Some poems were copied from big magazines like Boy's Own Paper. Gallenzi thinks Thomas did this because he wanted to be noticed or felt unsure about himself. Thomas's father was a teacher at the school and might have pushed him to do well. This shows that even famous people can make mistakes when they are young.",
