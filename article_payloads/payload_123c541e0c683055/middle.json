  "title": "Dylan Thomas's Schoolboy Plagiarism Revealed by Researcher",
  "summary": "Alessandro Gallenzi, an author and publicist, uncovered that Dylan Thomas, the iconic Welsh poet, engaged in plagiarism during his school years. While editing a new collection of Thomas's poetry, Gallenzi found at least a dozen instances where Thomas copied poems from other sources and published them under his own name in Swansea Grammar School's magazine. The discovery was initially made by Gallenzi's editor, Alex Middleton, after accessing a rare complete collection of the school magazine owned by Geoff Haden of the Dylan Thomas Society. Gallenzi described the plagiarism as 'wholesale,' noting that Thomas copied from publications like the Western Mail and Boy's Own Paper, including a poem by Lillian Gard. He believes Thomas may have plagiarized up to 20-24 poems. Gallenzi suggests reasons for this behavior, such as Thomas's insecurity, desire to impress peers at his new school, and pressure from his father, who was an English teacher there. This finding provides insight into Thomas's early development and raises questions about his motivations, highlighting how even celebrated figures can have complex pasts.",
