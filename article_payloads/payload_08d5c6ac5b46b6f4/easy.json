  "title": "Brazilian Judge Moves Convicted Plotters to House Arrest",
  "summary": "In Brazil, a judge decided on Saturday to put 10 people under house arrest. These people were found guilty of trying to help former President Jair Bolsonaro stay in power after he lost the 2022 election. They had been wearing ankle monitors or had to stay home at night before this change. One of them is Filipe Martins, who used to advise Bolsonaro. His lawyer said they will appeal the decision. Bolsonaro himself is in prison for 27 years for his role in the plot. He is currently in the hospital for surgery and hiccups. This story is important because Brazil has a history of military rule, and people are watching these trials to protect democracy.",
