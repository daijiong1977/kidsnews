  "title": "A New Planet That Might Have Life",
  "summary": "Astronomers from the University of California, Irvine have found a new planet called GJ 251 c that is not too far from Earth. This planet is in a special area around its star where it might be warm enough for liquid water to exist. Water is important for life as we know it. The planet is rocky like Earth but bigger, so it's called a super-Earth. It orbits a common type of star called an M-dwarf, which can be active with flares and spots. Scientists used special tools to detect the planet by watching how it makes its star wobble. They hope to use a big new telescope called the Thirty Meter Telescope to take pictures of the planet and see if it has water. This discovery is exciting because it could help us learn if there is life elsewhere in space.",

    "Space is full of stars and planets. Our solar system has Earth and other planets, but scientists have found many planets around other stars, called exoplanets. Some of these might have conditions like Earth, with water and possibly life. Telescopes help us see these faraway worlds, and new tools make it easier to find them. Learning about exoplanets helps us understand if we are alone in the universe."
