  "title": "How a Missing Protein Makes Our Immune System Weaker as We Age",
  "summary": "As people get older, their immune system can become weaker, making it harder to fight off sickness. Scientists have found that a protein called platelet factor 4 is important for keeping our immune system strong. This protein helps control special cells in our bone marrow called blood stem cells, which make all the cells in our blood and immune system. When we are young, platelet factor 4 tells these stem cells when to divide and make new cells. But as we age, our bodies produce less of this protein. Without enough platelet factor 4, the stem cells divide too much and can get damaged, leading to more health problems like infections or cancer. In experiments with mice, scientists showed that adding back platelet factor 4 to older cells helped reverse some signs of aging, making them act like younger cells again. This discovery could lead to new treatments to help older people stay healthier by boosting their immune systems.",

    "Our bodies have an immune system that protects us from germs like viruses and bacteria. As we get older, this system can become weaker, making it easier to get sick. Scientists study how special cells in our bone marrow, called blood stem cells, help make immune cells. They found that a protein called platelet factor 4 is like a traffic signal for these stem cells, telling them when to make new cells. When we age, we have less of this protein, so the stem cells might not work right, leading to health issues. This research helps us understand aging better and could lead to ways to keep older people healthier."
