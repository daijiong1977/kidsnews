  "title": "A Big Budget Plan for Taxes and Spending",
  "summary": "This article talks about a new budget plan by the government, where the leader, Rachel Reeves, wants to raise taxes on big earners and spend more money to help people. She says this will do good things, like lifting many children out of poverty by removing a rule that limited help for families with more than two kids. Some people in her party are very happy, but others worry because polls show that keeping the old rule was also popular. The government hopes this plan will make them look good to voters and financial markets, so they can borrow money cheaply and improve their low poll ratings. It's all about balancing different opinions to help the country.",

    "In the UK, the government makes a budget each year to decide how to spend money on things like schools, hospitals, and benefits for people. Taxes are collected from citizens and businesses to pay for these services. Universal Credit is a benefit that helps people with low incomes. Rachel Reeves is the Chancellor, which means she is in charge of the country's finances. Sometimes, governments change rules to help families, like removing limits on benefits for children, to reduce poverty and make life better for everyone."
