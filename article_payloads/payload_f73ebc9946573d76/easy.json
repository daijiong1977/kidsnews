  "title": "Ancient Mammoth Tusk Patterns Tell a Story",
  "summary": "Scientists found old patterns on mammoth tusks in caves in Germany that might be a very early form of writing. These patterns are lines, dots, and crosses carved into the tusks, which are about 45,000 years old. Before this, people thought writing started around 5,000 years ago in places like ancient Iraq. The researchers think Stone Age people used these symbols to share messages and show they were smart, just like us today. They studied over 3,000 characters on 260 objects to learn more. The exact meaning of the symbols is still unknown, but it helps us understand how humans communicated long ago.",

    "Long ago, before people had paper or computers, they found ways to share ideas. In caves, they left marks on things like mammoth tusks, which are from big animals that lived during the Ice Age. Scientists study these marks to learn about early human life and how they talked to each other. This helps us see that ancient humans were creative and smart, just like we are today."
