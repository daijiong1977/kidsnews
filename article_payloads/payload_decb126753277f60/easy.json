  "title": "Eurovision Live Tour Delayed for 2026",
  "summary": "The Eurovision Song Contest live tour for 2026 has been postponed. It was supposed to travel to 10 countries in Europe this summer, starting in London. Martin Green, who helps run Eurovision, said unexpected problems made them decide to delay the tour. Fans who bought tickets will get their money back. The tour was planned to celebrate Eurovision's 70th birthday and include famous past singers like Johnny Logan and Katrina. Eurovision will still happen in May 2026 in Vienna, and they hope to do the tour later when they can make it great for fans. Some countries are not joining the 2026 contest due to disagreements, but the organizers are changing voting rules to make it fairer.",

    "The Eurovision Song Contest is a big music competition where countries in Europe send singers to perform songs. People vote for their favorite, and the winner gets a trophy. It started in 1956 and happens every year. The live tour was a new idea to celebrate its 70th birthday by taking shows to different cities. Sometimes, countries decide not to join because they disagree with things happening in the world or how the voting works. Organizers try to fix problems to keep the contest fun and fair for everyone."
