  "title": "Christmas Travel Rush: Millions on the Move",
  "summary": "Today is a very busy day for Christmas travel in Britain. Millions of people are driving cars, taking trains, or flying on planes to go home for the holidays. Experts say it might be the busiest Christmas ever on the roads, with over 24 million car trips expected. Airports are also crowded, with many passengers flying. Drivers are told to be patient, plan their trips ahead, and allow extra time because there could be traffic jams in places like near London, Birmingham, and other cities. Some roads are even closed for repairs, so people need to find different routes. The advice is to check traffic updates before leaving to have a safe and happy journey.",
