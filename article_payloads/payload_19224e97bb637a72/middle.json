  "title": "Festive Getaway Chaos: Record Travel Numbers Hit UK",
  "summary": "The Christmas getaway in Britain is reaching its peak, with Friday anticipated as the busiest day for travel. According to the AA, roads could see up to 24.4 million car journeys, potentially making this the busiest Christmas on record for UK roads. Drivers are advised to plan ahead, check live traffic updates, and allow extra time due to expected congestion at key interchanges such as the M3/M25 in Surrey and the M25 around Heathrow. Outside London, hotspots include the M8 between Edinburgh and Glasgow and the M5/M6 interchange near Birmingham. Additionally, the M27 will be closed in Hampshire for repairs from Christmas Eve to January 4, necessitating alternative routes. Airports are also experiencing high traffic, with Heathrow expecting about 250,000 passengers daily and Manchester Airport around 100,000 on Friday, marking it as the busiest day of the festive season. Network Rail recommends travelers check journeys and book seats where possible. Overall, the emphasis is on patience and preparation to navigate the festive rush safely.",
