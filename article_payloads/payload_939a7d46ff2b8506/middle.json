  "title": "Discovery of a Millisecond Pulsar Candidate Near the Galactic Center Black Hole",
  "summary": "Researchers from Columbia University, in collaboration with Breakthrough Listen, have identified a candidate millisecond pulsar located close to Sagittarius A*, the supermassive black hole at the center of the Milky Way. This discovery was made through the Breakthrough Listen Galactic Center Survey, a highly sensitive radio investigation. Pulsars are neutron stars that emit regular radio pulses, acting as precise cosmic clocks due to their stable timing. Millisecond pulsars spin exceptionally fast, enhancing their reliability. If confirmed, this pulsar could provide a unique opportunity to test Einstein's General Theory of Relativity by measuring how the black hole's intense gravity distorts space-time and affects the pulsar's signals. The gravitational pull of Sagittarius A*, which has about 4 million solar masses, may cause anomalies in pulse arrival times, allowing scientists to study extreme gravitational environments. Follow-up observations are underway to verify the candidate, and data has been made publicly available to encourage global scientific collaboration. This research, led by Karen I. Perez and published in The Astrophysical Journal, aims to advance our understanding of galactic dynamics and fundamental physics.",

    "Astronomy involves studying celestial objects like pulsars and black holes. Pulsars are neutron stars that emit radio pulses, serving as precise clocks due to their regular timing. Black holes, especially supermassive ones like Sagittarius A*, have immense gravity that warps space-time. Einstein's General Theory of Relativity explains how mass curves space-time, affecting light and time. This article discusses a survey using radio telescopes to detect a pulsar near a black hole, which could test relativity in extreme conditions. Scientific collaboration through data sharing helps accelerate discoveries in astrophysics."
