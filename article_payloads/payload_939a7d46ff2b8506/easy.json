  "title": "A Fast-Spinning Star Clock Found Near a Giant Black Hole",
  "summary": "Scientists have found a special star called a pulsar near a huge black hole at the center of our galaxy, the Milky Way. This pulsar spins very fast, like a cosmic clock, and sends out radio waves. If it is real, it could help test Einstein's ideas about gravity. Pulsars are made from old stars and are very dense. The black hole, named Sagittarius A*, is super heavy and pulls on things around it. Researchers are checking more data to see if the pulsar is really there. They are sharing their findings so other scientists can help study it too. This discovery might teach us more about space and gravity.",

    "Scientists study space to learn about stars, black holes, and gravity. Pulsars are special stars that spin and send signals. Black holes are areas with very strong gravity. Einstein was a famous scientist who explained how gravity bends space and time. This article talks about finding a pulsar near a big black hole to test these ideas."
