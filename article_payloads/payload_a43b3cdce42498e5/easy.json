  "title": "Scientists Test Eating Times Without Eating Less",
  "summary": "Scientists did a study to see if eating only during certain hours helps people's health without eating less food. They tested 31 women who ate the same amount of food but at different times: early from 8 a.m. to 4 p.m. or late from 1 p.m. to 9 p.m. After two weeks, they found no big changes in health things like how the body uses sugar or fat. But they did see that eating times can change the body's internal clock, which is like a timer inside us that tells us when to sleep or be active. This means that just changing when you eat, without eating less, might not make you healthier. The study was done by scientists in Germany and published in a science journal.",

    "This article is about a science study that looked at how eating at different times affects health. Scientists wanted to know if just changing when you eat, without eating less food, can make you healthier. They tested women by having them eat the same meals but at early or late hours. They found that it didn't help much with things like sugar in the blood, but it did shift the body's internal clock. This helps us understand that eating less might be more important than when you eat for getting healthier."
