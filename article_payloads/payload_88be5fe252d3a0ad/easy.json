  "title": "The Secret Code in Wagyu Cows: How Scientists Found New Genes",
  "summary": "Scientists at the University of Adelaide have made a big discovery about Wagyu cows, which are famous for their tasty and fatty beef called marbling. They created a new and better map of the cow's genes, which is like a secret code that tells how the cow grows. This map is 16% longer than the old one, so it shows more hidden parts of the genes. The scientists found hundreds of new genes and special changes in the genes that might make the beef better. This helps farmers choose the best cows to breed for more marbling, which can make the beef industry earn more money. The research was done with help from the United States Department of Agriculture and was published in a science journal. It can also help other types of cows, not just Wagyu, by improving traits like health and baby-making.",

    "Cows are animals that give us beef to eat. Wagyu cows are a special kind from Japan known for very tasty beef with lots of marbling, which is fat mixed into the meat. Genes are like instructions inside all living things that decide how they look and act. Scientists study genes to understand animals better. Breeding means picking certain animals to have babies so their traits, like marbling, get passed on. This helps farmers make better food and earn money."
