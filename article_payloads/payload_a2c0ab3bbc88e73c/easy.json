  "title": "Why Your Gadgets Might Cost More in 2026",
  "summary": "In 2026, many devices like phones, computers, and TVs could become more expensive because of a big price jump in a part called Ram. Ram is a tiny piece inside gadgets that helps them work by storing information while you use them. The price of Ram has more than doubled since late 2025. This happened because data centers, which are huge buildings that power things like AI, need a lot of Ram too, making it harder to get enough for everyone. When there isn't enough Ram for all the people who want it, the price goes up. Companies that make gadgets might have to charge more money to cover these higher costs. Experts say this could last into 2026, and if prices don't go down, people might buy fewer gadgets. Ram is in almost every device, so this affects many things we use every day.",
