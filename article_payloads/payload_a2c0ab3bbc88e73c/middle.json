  "title": "The Rising Cost of Ram and Its Impact on Tech Prices in 2026",
  "summary": "In 2026, consumers may face higher prices for electronic devices such as smartphones, PCs, and smart TVs due to a significant increase in the cost of Ram, a critical computer component. Ram, or random access memory, is essential for storing code and data temporarily while devices are in use, making it ubiquitous across technology. Since October 2025, Ram prices have more than doubled, driven by explosive growth in data centers that power artificial intelligence (AI), which also require substantial amounts of Ram. This surge has created an imbalance between supply and demand, forcing manufacturers to consider passing on these costs to consumers. Industry experts, like Steve Mason from CyberPowerPC, report quotes up to 500% higher than recent months, indicating that large cost increases are likely to affect pricing decisions. Manufacturers may absorb small hikes, but these substantial rises could lead to price adjustments on products using memory or storage. Danny Williams from PCSpecialist predicts that if prices don't decline, consumer demand might drop in 2026, highlighting broader economic impacts. The situation underscores how interconnected tech supply chains are, with Ram shortages affecting everything from personal gadgets to medical devices.",
