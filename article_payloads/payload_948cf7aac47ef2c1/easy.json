  "title": "Deep Sea Surprise: A New Home for Ocean Creatures",
  "summary": "Scientists have found a special place deep in the ocean near Papua New Guinea where hot water and cool gas come out of the seafloor together. This has never been seen before! The hot water is from underground heat, and the cool gas is methane from old organic material in the sediment. This mix creates a unique home for many animals like mussels, tube worms, shrimp, and purple sea cucumbers. The site is called 'Karambusel', which means 'mussel' in a local language. Sadly, mining nearby could harm this amazing ecosystem. This discovery helps us learn more about life in the deep sea and why we need to protect it.",

    "The deep sea is the part of the ocean that is very dark and deep, where sunlight doesn't reach. Scientists explore it using special robots and submarines to find new animals and learn how Earth works. Hydrothermal vents are like underwater geysers that release hot, mineral-rich water, supporting unique life forms. Methane is a natural gas that can be food for some bacteria. Mining involves digging for valuable metals, but it can damage habitats. Protecting these places is important for biodiversity, which means having many different kinds of life."
