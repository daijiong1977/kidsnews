  "title": "Shoplifting in the UK: A Growing Problem for Stores",
  "summary": "Shoplifting is a big problem in the UK, where people steal things from stores. A store owner named Muhammed in Stockton-on-Tees says it happens every day and costs his family business a lot of money. Sometimes, thieves get violent and hurt people. Police numbers show shoplifting went up by 13% in England and Wales, with over 500,000 cases. In Scotland, it increased by 15%. Experts say shoplifting is changing, with more people stealing different items. During Christmas, stores expect more theft because there is high demand for stolen goods. Many shoplifting cases are not reported to the police, so the real number might be much higher. Store owners often feel that police do not take action after thefts are reported.",
