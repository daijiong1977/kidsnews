  "title": "Analyzing NASA's Pioneering Medical Evacuation: Implications for Space Health and Mission Logistics",
  "summary": "NASA executed its inaugural medical evacuation from space, concluding the Crew-11 mission prematurely after 167 days aboard the International Space Station. The evacuation involved a multinational crew—two Americans, a Japanese astronaut, and a Russian cosmonaut—who returned via a SpaceX Crew Dragon spacecraft, achieving a precise splashdown in the Pacific Ocean near San Diego. This decision stemmed from an undisclosed medical condition affecting one crew member, which NASA characterized as non-emergent but posing a 'lingering risk' if unaddressed in orbit. Officials, including Chief Medical Officer James Polk, emphasized the controlled nature of the evacuation, distinguishing it from emergency scenarios like traumatic injuries. The early departure reduced the station's crew to three, impacting operational capabilities such as spacewalks and scientific research until the arrival of Crew-12. This event underscores evolving protocols in space medicine, balancing prophylactic health measures with mission objectives, and highlights the logistical challenges of maintaining a permanently staffed orbital laboratory.",
