  "title": "Astronauts Come Home Early from Space for Health Check",
  "summary": "Four astronauts came back to Earth early from the International Space Station because one of them had a health problem. They landed safely in the Pacific Ocean near San Diego using a SpaceX Crew Dragon spacecraft. The astronauts had been in space for 167 days, but they left over a month early to get medical help on the ground. NASA said it was not an emergency because the sick astronaut was stable, but they wanted to make sure they got proper treatment. The other astronauts on the station will now have fewer people to help with work until new astronauts arrive next month. This is the first time NASA has ended a space mission early for medical reasons.",
