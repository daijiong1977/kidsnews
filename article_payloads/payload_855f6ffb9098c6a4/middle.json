  "title": "NASA's First Medical Evacuation from Space: A Safe Return Mission",
  "summary": "NASA conducted its first-ever medical evacuation from space, ending the Crew-11 mission early after 167 days in orbit. The mission involved two American astronauts, a Japanese astronaut, and a Russian cosmonaut who returned to Earth aboard a SpaceX Crew Dragon spacecraft, splashing down accurately in the Pacific Ocean off San Diego. The decision was prompted by an unspecified medical issue affecting one crew member, though NASA officials emphasized it was not an emergency, as the astronaut was stable on the International Space Station. This controlled evacuation allowed for comprehensive medical treatment on the ground, avoiding lingering health risks. The early departure reduced the station's crew to three members until the arrival of Crew-12 next month, impacting operations like spacewalks and science programs. The event highlights NASA's preparedness for non-emergency health scenarios in space, balancing astronaut care with mission logistics.",
