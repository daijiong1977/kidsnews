  "title": "How a Few Cigarettes Can Hurt Your Heart for Many Years",
  "summary": "This article explains that smoking even a small number of cigarettes each day can be very harmful to your heart and health. Scientists looked at many studies and found that people who smoke just two to five cigarettes a day have a much higher chance of getting heart disease or dying early compared to those who never smoke. The good news is that if you quit smoking, your risk goes down over time, but it can take many years to get back to the same level as non-smokers. This is important because some people think smoking a little is okay, but it's not. The research shows that quitting completely is the best way to protect your heart and live a longer, healthier life.",
