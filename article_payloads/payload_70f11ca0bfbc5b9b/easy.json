  "title": "How Smoking a Few Cigarettes Can Hurt Your Heart",
  "summary": "Smoking even a small number of cigarettes each day can be very bad for your heart and health. A big study looked at many people over a long time and found that smoking just two to five cigarettes daily makes it much more likely to have heart problems or die early compared to people who never smoke. This higher risk can last for many years, even after someone stops smoking. The good news is that quitting smoking completely helps reduce the risk, especially if you stop when you are young. The researchers want everyone to know that cutting down on cigarettes is not enough; it's best to quit entirely to protect your heart and live a longer, healthier life.",
