  "title": "A Girl Gets a New Heart and Liver to Save Her Life",
  "summary": "Doctors at Children's Hospital Colorado did something amazing for the first time: they gave an 11-year-old girl named Gracie both a new heart and a new liver in one big surgery. Gracie was born with a heart problem called hypoplastic left heart syndrome, which means her heart had only one working part. She had surgeries when she was little to help her heart work better, but over time, it hurt her liver too. The doctors watched her closely for years and decided she needed two new organs to live a healthy life. Many specialists worked together for 16 hours to do the transplants. First, they put in the new heart, then they used a special machine to keep the new liver safe while they finished. This surgery is very rare—only 38 kids in the whole country have had it before. Thanks to the doctors' hard work and another family donating organs, Gracie now has a chance to be happy and active again.",

    "This article is about a medical breakthrough at a children's hospital. It tells the story of Gracie, an 11-year-old girl with a serious heart condition from birth. Over time, her heart problems affected her liver, so doctors decided she needed both organs replaced. The surgery was very complex and involved many experts working together for many hours. It shows how modern medicine can save lives through teamwork and advanced technology, like special machines to preserve organs. This kind of dual transplant is rare, making it a big achievement for the hospital and a hopeful story for other kids with similar illnesses."
