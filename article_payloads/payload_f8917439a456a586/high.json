  "title": "Pioneering Pediatric Dual Organ Transplant: A Case Study in Medical Complexity",
  "summary": "Children's Hospital Colorado has executed its inaugural dual heart and liver transplant, a procedurally intricate milestone for pediatric transplant medicine, performed on an 11-year-old patient, Gracie Greenlaw. Gracie's medical trajectory began with hypoplastic left heart syndrome (HLHS), a congenital cardiac anomaly characterized by an underdeveloped left ventricle, necessitating staged palliative surgeries—the Norwood, Glenn, and Fontan procedures—in early childhood. While these interventions facilitated survival, they precipitated long-term sequelae, including hepatic dysfunction culminating in liver failure, exacerbated by conditions such as plastic bronchitis. In response, the institution's Fontan Multidisciplinary Clinic, established in 2016 within its Single Ventricle Program, provided holistic, coordinated care, integrating cardiology and hepatology expertise to monitor and manage her deteriorating health. As Gracie's symptomatology intensified, her care team, comprising specialists like Dr. Kathleen Simpson and Dr. Dania Brigham, determined that a dual transplant was imperative for optimal long-term outcomes. Following waitlist placement in April, donor organs became available within a month, triggering a meticulously orchestrated 16-hour operation. The surgical sequence initiated with cardiothoracic surgeons performing the heart transplant, while the donor liver was sustained on a TransMedics Organ Care System—a perfusion device that emulates physiological conditions to prolong organ viability. Subsequently, transplant surgeons completed the hepatic implantation. This endeavor involved multidisciplinary coordination across 25 teams, addressing challenges like hemodynamic stability and electrolyte homeostasis. With only 38 analogous pediatric cases documented nationally, this achievement underscores advancements in organ preservation technology, surgical collaboration, and the evolving management of congenital heart disease complications, reflecting broader trends in transplant immunology and patient-centered care.",
