  "title": "Historic Dual Organ Transplant Saves 11-Year-Old's Life",
  "summary": "Children's Hospital Colorado achieved a medical milestone by performing its first-ever dual heart and liver transplant on an 11-year-old patient, Gracie Greenlaw. Gracie was born with hypoplastic left heart syndrome (HLHS), a congenital condition where her heart had only one functioning pumping chamber. She underwent three major surgeries in early childhood—the Norwood, Glenn, and Fontan procedures—to improve blood circulation. However, these interventions and HLHS itself led to long-term complications, including liver damage and eventual liver failure. To manage such cases, the hospital established the Fontan Multidisciplinary Clinic in 2016, providing coordinated care for patients with single ventricle conditions. Gracie's condition worsened over time, with symptoms like plastic bronchitis and signs of liver failure, prompting her medical team to recommend a dual transplant. After being placed on the waitlist in April, compatible donor organs became available less than a month later. The 16-hour surgery involved dozens of specialists: heart surgeons performed the heart transplant first, while the donor liver was preserved on a TransMedics Organ Care System, a device that mimics normal liver function. Then, liver transplant surgeons completed the procedure. This complex operation required careful planning for challenges like blood volume and electrolyte management. Nationally, only 38 pediatric patients have received such dual transplants, highlighting the rarity and significance of this achievement. The success underscores years of preparation, teamwork, and advanced medical technology in pediatric transplant care.",

    "This article details a groundbreaking medical event at Children's Hospital Colorado, involving the first dual heart and liver transplant for an 11-year-old patient. It explores the challenges of congenital heart disease, specifically hypoplastic left heart syndrome (HLHS), which affects heart development and can lead to secondary issues like liver failure. The hospital's Fontan Multidisciplinary Clinic, established in 2016, plays a key role in managing such complex cases through coordinated care. The transplant process involved extensive preparation, including addressing conditions like plastic bronchitis and using advanced technology like the TransMedics Organ Care System to preserve organs. With only 38 similar pediatric cases nationwide, this surgery represents a significant advancement in transplant medicine, emphasizing the importance of donor organ availability, surgical expertise, and interdisciplinary collaboration in saving lives."
