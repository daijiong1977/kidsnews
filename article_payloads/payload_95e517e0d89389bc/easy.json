  "title": "Trump's Lawsuit Against the BBC Goes to Trial",
  "summary": "Former US President Donald Trump is suing the BBC, a news company, for defamation. He says the BBC edited a speech he gave to make it look like he told people to storm the Capitol building on January 6, 2021. The trial is set for February 2027 in Miami and will last two weeks. The BBC wants to dismiss the case, but a judge said they must continue sharing evidence. Trump wants money for the edited speech, but the BBC says it is not defamation. This is a legal fight about how news is reported.",
