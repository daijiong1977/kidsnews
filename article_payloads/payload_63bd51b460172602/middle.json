  "title": "Unraveling the Mystery of a Fast-Spinning Star Near a Black Hole",
  "summary": "Astronomers from the University of Hawaiʻi Institute for Astronomy have investigated a red giant star orbiting a dormant black hole in the Gaia BH2 system. Using NASA's TESS satellite, they detected starquakes—subtle vibrations in the star's light—that allowed them to probe its interior. Analysis revealed the star is about 5 billion years old but has a chemical composition typical of much older stars, creating a puzzle. Additionally, the star rotates every 398 days, an unusually fast rate for a red giant. Researchers propose this indicates a past stellar merger or interaction, where the star collided with another, gaining mass and spin. The black hole, Gaia BH2, is quiet and not accreting material, identified through stellar motion rather than X-ray emissions. The study also compared Gaia BH3, another system where expected oscillations were absent, suggesting revisions to theories about low-metal stars. This work enhances understanding of stellar evolution and black hole formation, with future TESS observations aiming to confirm the merger hypothesis and explore these systems further.",

    "Stars evolve through life cycles, with red giants representing an advanced stage where they expand and cool. Black holes are regions of spacetime with intense gravity, often formed from collapsed stars. Dormant black holes do not emit significant radiation, making them hard to detect except through gravitational influences on companion stars. Starquakes, or asteroseismology, use oscillations to infer internal stellar properties, similar to seismology on Earth. The Gaia mission maps the Milky Way, while TESS surveys stars for transits and variability. Stellar mergers can alter a star's characteristics, such as spin and composition, providing clues about binary system histories. This research connects to broader astrophysical questions about stellar formation and black hole demographics."
