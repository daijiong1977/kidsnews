  "title": "A Star That Spins Fast Near a Black Hole",
  "summary": "Astronomers found a strange star near a black hole. The star is a red giant, which is a big, old star. They used a satellite called TESS to watch the star's light. They saw tiny changes in brightness called starquakes, like earthquakes in space. These starquakes helped them learn about the star's inside. The star is spinning very fast, which is unusual. Scientists think it might have crashed into another star long ago, making it spin faster. The star is also younger than it looks based on its chemicals. This star and the black hole are in a system called Gaia BH2. The black hole is quiet and not eating anything. Studying this helps us understand how stars and black holes form and change over time.",

    "Stars are giant balls of gas that produce light and heat. Some stars, like red giants, get bigger as they age. Black holes are invisible objects with strong gravity that can pull in nearby things. Astronomers use tools like satellites to study stars from Earth. Starquakes are small shakes that help scientists learn about a star's inside, similar to how earthquakes tell us about Earth's layers. When stars crash or merge, they can change how they spin and look."
