  "title": "AI Helps Doctors Read Brain Scans Quickly",
  "summary": "Scientists at the University of Michigan made a new AI tool called Prima that can look at brain MRI scans very fast, in just seconds. It helps doctors find problems in the brain, like strokes or bleeding, with high accuracy of 97.5%. Prima can also tell which patients need help right away, so doctors can act quickly. This tool uses pictures and text together to understand the scans better than older AI. It was tested on over 30,000 MRI scans and works like a radiologist by checking patient history too. Prima aims to reduce the workload for doctors and improve care by giving fast and accurate information.",

    "Brain MRI scans are special pictures that doctors use to see inside your head and check for problems like injuries or diseases. AI, or Artificial Intelligence, is technology that helps computers learn and make decisions, similar to how people think. In hospitals, doctors called radiologists read these scans, but it can take a long time. The new AI tool Prima helps by reading scans quickly and accurately, so patients with emergencies like strokes get help faster. This makes hospitals work better and reduces stress on doctors."
