  "title": "Swearing Can Make You Stronger and Feel Less Pain",
  "summary": "Scientists have found that saying bad words can help people feel less pain and become stronger. In experiments, people put their hands in ice water and did exercises while swearing or saying normal words. Those who swore felt less pain and could do exercises longer. This might be because swearing helps us let go of feelings and focus better. It is like a free tool to boost our performance without using medicine. The studies show that swearing is not just for being rude; it can actually help us in tough situations.",

    "Swearing means saying bad words that some people think are rude. Scientists do experiments to learn how things work. In this case, they tested if swearing helps with pain and strength. Pain is what you feel when you get hurt, like bumping your knee. Strength is how much power your body has to do things like lifting or running. This research shows that sometimes, doing something simple like swearing can help us in surprising ways."
