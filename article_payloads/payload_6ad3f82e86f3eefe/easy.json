  "title": "Mapping the Invisible Universe with Galaxy Shapes",
  "summary": "Scientists are exploring the invisible parts of the universe, called dark matter and dark energy, which make up most of space but cannot be seen. They use a tool called weak gravitational lensing, where light from galaxies gets bent by matter, to study these hidden forces. A project called the Dark Energy Survey measured the shapes of over 150 million galaxies from 2013 to 2019 using a camera in Chile. Recently, researchers at the University of Chicago added more data, doubling the number of galaxies studied, to check if their findings match a standard model of the universe. They found that the growth of structures in space aligns with predictions, helping us understand how the universe evolves. This work is important because it uses galaxy shapes to learn about dark matter and dark energy without seeing them directly.",

    "The universe is mostly made of things we cannot see, like dark matter and dark energy. Scientists use special tools, such as weak gravitational lensing, to study these by looking at how galaxy shapes change. Projects like the Dark Energy Survey help gather data from telescopes. This helps us understand how the universe grows and changes over time, using simple ideas like bending light and measuring shapes."
