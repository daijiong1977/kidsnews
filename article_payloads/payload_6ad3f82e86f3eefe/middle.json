  "title": "Exploring Dark Matter and Dark Energy Through Galaxy Distortions",
  "summary": "Astrophysicists are investigating the invisible components of the universe, primarily dark matter and dark energy, which constitute about 95% of the cosmos but remain poorly understood. To study these, researchers employ weak gravitational lensing, a phenomenon where light from distant galaxies is slightly distorted as it passes through matter, including dark matter. The Dark Energy Survey (DES), conducted from 2013 to 2019 using the Dark Energy Camera in Chile, measured shapes of over 150 million galaxies across a significant portion of the sky. Recently, scientists from the University of Chicago expanded this dataset by incorporating additional observations, nearly doubling the number of galaxies analyzed. This allowed them to test the Lambda-CDM (LCDM) model, the standard cosmological framework that includes dark energy, dark matter, ordinary matter, neutrinos, and radiation. By measuring galaxy shapes and distances through redshift analysis, the team found that the growth of cosmic structures aligns with LCDM predictions and agrees with early universe data from the cosmic microwave background. This work addresses inconsistencies in previous studies and provides independent verification, enhancing our understanding of how the universe evolves and the roles of dark matter and dark energy.",

    "Cosmology studies the universe's origin and evolution, with dark matter and dark energy as key mysteries. Weak gravitational lensing allows scientists to infer mass distribution by observing slight distortions in galaxy shapes. The Lambda-CDM model is a widely accepted framework that incorporates these elements. Projects like the Dark Energy Survey collect vast amounts of data to test this model, using tools like redshift to measure distances. Understanding these concepts helps explain how cosmic structures form and change over time."
