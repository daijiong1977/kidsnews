  "title": "How Brain Cells Help Mice See Again After Injury",
  "summary": "Scientists used to think that brain cells, called neurons, cannot grow back after they are hurt. But a new study with mice shows something amazing. When mice had a brain injury that affected their vision, some cells in their eyes and brains did not die. Instead, these surviving cells grew extra tiny branches, like tree branches, to connect with more brain cells. This helped the mice see better again, even though some cells were lost. The study also found that male mice recovered their vision faster than female mice. This research helps scientists understand how the brain can heal itself after injuries, which might lead to better treatments for people with brain problems in the future.",

    "Neurons are special cells in our brain and eyes that help us see, think, and move. When they get hurt, it can cause problems like trouble seeing. Scientists study mice to learn about how brains work because mice have similar brains to humans. This study shows that even if some cells are lost, others can adapt by growing new connections, which might help people recover from brain injuries in the future."
