  "summary": "This article is about a word game called Quordle that you can play every day. It gives hints to help you solve the puzzle without giving away the answers right away. The game has four words to guess, and the hints tell you things like how many vowels are in the words or if any letters are repeated. For example, today's game has five different vowels and one word with a repeated letter. The article also warns you not to read further if you don't want to see the answers, so you can keep your winning streak going. It's a fun way to practice spelling and thinking skills, and if you like word games, you might enjoy others like Wordle or Connections too.",
