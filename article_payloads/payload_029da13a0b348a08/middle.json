  "title": "Congressional Debate Over War Powers After Iran Strike",
  "summary": "Following President Trump's military strike on Iran without congressional approval, key members of Congress are demanding a swift vote on a war powers resolution to restrain further actions. Bipartisan efforts in both the House and Senate aim to pass resolutions that would require the administration to seek authorization for ongoing military campaigns, warning that unilateral strikes risk illegal escalation and deeper Middle East conflicts. Democrats like Sen. Tim Kaine criticize the move as a mistake based on past U.S. interventions, while Republicans such as Sen. Lindsey Graham support it as a necessary response to Iran's threats. The Constitution grants Congress the power to declare war, but presidents have historically acted independently in some cases, leading to a separation of powers test. Although the debate is largely symbolic—since any resolution would likely face a presidential veto and lack override votes—it highlights ongoing tensions between executive authority and legislative oversight in U.S. foreign policy.",

  "background_read": [
    "The U.S. Constitution establishes a system of checks and balances, with Article I granting Congress the power to declare war, while Article II makes the president commander-in-chief. This has led to ongoing debates over war powers, especially since the 1973 War Powers Resolution, which aims to limit presidential military actions without congressional approval. Historical conflicts like the Iraq War involved congressional authorization, but recent strikes often bypass this process. The article discusses how the Iran strike tests these norms, with bipartisan concerns about executive overreach and the risks of unauthorized military engagements in volatile regions like the Middle East."

  "Article_Structure": [
    "The article analyzes the congressional response to President Trump's Iran strike, covering main points like bipartisan demands for a war powers vote, constitutional separation of powers, and symbolic political debates. Its purpose is to inform about tensions between executive and legislative branches in military decisions. Evidence includes quotes from senators and historical references, though it relies on AP reporting without deep source evaluation. Author credibility is moderate as an AP journalist, but the article presents balanced perspectives. Methodology involves summarizing political statements and constitutional context, providing a clear overview of the issue."
