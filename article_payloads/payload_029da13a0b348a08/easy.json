  "title": "Congress Wants a Say on Iran Strike",
  "summary": "After President Trump ordered a military strike on Iran without asking Congress, some members of Congress are pushing for a quick vote on a rule called a war powers resolution. This rule would limit the president's ability to attack Iran unless Congress agrees. Democrats and Republicans in both the House and Senate are working together on this. They say the strike was a big mistake and could lead to more fighting in the Middle East. But many Republicans support the president's action, saying Iran is a threat. The Constitution says Congress has the power to declare war, but presidents can sometimes act alone. Even if Congress passes the resolution, President Trump might veto it, and Congress may not have enough votes to override the veto. This debate is mostly symbolic but shows how government branches check each other.",

    "In the United States, the government has three branches: the President, Congress, and the courts. The Constitution gives Congress the power to declare war, but presidents can sometimes use the military without asking first. This has led to debates about who should make big decisions like starting wars. The article talks about a recent strike on Iran and how Congress wants to have a say in it to prevent more conflicts."
