  "title": "Help for Kids with Special Needs in School",
  "summary": "In England, some kids need extra help in school because they have special educational needs and disabilities, called SEND. Right now, they get a plan called an EHCP that says what help they should get. The government might change this plan. They want to check if kids still need the same help when they move from primary to secondary school. This could start in 2029. Some people, like teachers and politicians, say the current system is not working well and needs big changes. They want to make sure all kids get the right support. The new plan might give more kids legal rights to help through school-led plans. This is important because many kids have EHCPs, and parents often struggle to get them. The government says they will share more details soon.",

    "In England, schools help kids who have special needs, like learning difficulties or disabilities. These kids might need extra things like therapy or one-on-one time with a teacher. A plan called an EHCP is made to list this help. Parents often work hard to get these plans, but the system can be tricky. The government is thinking about changing how this works to help more kids and make it fairer when they move to bigger schools."
