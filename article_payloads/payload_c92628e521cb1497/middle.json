  "title": "Pras Michel's 14-Year Sentence for Political Corruption",
  "summary": "Pras Michel, a former member of the Fugees, has been sentenced to 14 years in federal prison after being convicted on multiple charges, including acting as an unregistered foreign agent, witness tampering, and campaign finance violations. The case, prosecuted in Washington DC, revealed that Michel received over $100 million from Malaysian billionaire Jho Low, which was used to influence US politics during the Obama and Trump administrations. Prosecutors argued that Michel engaged in secret lobbying for China and other entities, betraying national interests for financial gain. Despite their recommendation for a life sentence, Judge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly imposed a 14-year term. Michel's defense plans to appeal, claiming the sentence is disproportionate. The trial featured testimonies from high-profile figures like Leonardo DiCaprio and Jeff Sessions, highlighting the intersection of celebrity, money, and political corruption.",

    "Pras Michel gained fame as part of the Fugees, a hip-hop group that achieved commercial success and won Grammy Awards. In US politics, lobbying is regulated to prevent undue influence, especially from foreign entities. The Foreign Agents Registration Act requires disclosure of activities on behalf of foreign governments. This case illustrates how individuals can exploit financial resources to sway political outcomes, raising concerns about integrity in governance. Understanding such cases helps middle school students grasp the importance of legal compliance and the consequences of corruption in a democratic society."
