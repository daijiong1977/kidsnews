  "summary": "Pras Michel, a famous rapper from the group Fugees, has been sentenced to 14 years in prison. He was found guilty of using money to influence politics in the United States. Prosecutors said he received over $100 million from a rich man named Jho Low and used it to try to change government decisions. He was also accused of working for China's government without telling anyone. During his trial, he did not speak in court, but his lawyer said the punishment is too harsh and they will appeal. This case involved important people like Leonardo DiCaprio and Jeff Sessions, who testified. The judge decided on the sentence after he was convicted of crimes like corruption and lying to banks.",

    "Pras Michel is a musician who was part of the hip-hop group Fugees, which won Grammy Awards. In the United States, it is illegal to use money to influence politicians without reporting it, especially if the money comes from other countries. This case shows how celebrities can get involved in serious crimes and face long prison sentences. Understanding this helps us learn about the importance of honesty in politics and the consequences of breaking the law."
