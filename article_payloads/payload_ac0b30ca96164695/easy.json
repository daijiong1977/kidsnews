  "title": "A New Leader for the Arts Center",
  "summary": "The Trump-Kennedy Center, a famous arts place, has a new leader named Richard Grenell. He was chosen by President Trump. Some artists are canceling shows because they don't like the changes, like the new name. Grenell says the center is doing well with money now. He explains that before, the center used savings to pay workers, which is not good. Now, with President Trump's help, they have more money from tickets, donors, and companies. Grenell thinks reporters should talk more about the money side instead of just the artists leaving. He wants people to see the full story of how arts places can be successful.",
