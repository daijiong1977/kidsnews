  "title": "Mysterious Red Dots in Space Photos Solved",
  "summary": "The James Webb Space Telescope took pictures of space and found strange red dots. Scientists from the University of Copenhagen studied them for two years. They discovered these red dots are young black holes. Black holes are very strong objects that pull in gas and dust. The black holes are hidden inside thick clouds of gas. When they eat the gas, it gets very hot and glows red. This makes the red dots we see. The black holes are not as big as people thought. They are about 10 million times heavier than the Sun. Scientists call them 'messy eaters' because they blow out most of the gas instead of swallowing it. This helps us learn how black holes grow in the early universe.",

    "The James Webb Space Telescope is a powerful telescope launched in 2021 to look at distant space. Black holes are mysterious objects with strong gravity that can pull in everything, even light. Scientists study them to understand how the universe began and how things like stars and galaxies form. This article talks about new discoveries from space photos that help solve a puzzle about red dots."
