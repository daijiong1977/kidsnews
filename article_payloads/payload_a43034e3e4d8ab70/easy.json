  "title": "Friends Help the Leader Keep His Job",
  "summary": "This article talks about the prime minister, Sir Keir Starmer, and his friends who are worried that he might lose his job soon. They are saying that he will fight hard to stay as the leader. The prime minister is the person in charge of the country, and his job is important. His friends are called allies, and they support him. They think that some people are trying to replace him, but he is not giving up. This is happening in the government, where leaders make big decisions. It's like when someone in school might try to take over as class president, but the current president works hard to keep the position. The article helps us understand how leaders can face challenges and how their friends help them.",
