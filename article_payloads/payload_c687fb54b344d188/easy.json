  "title": "Olivia Dean Helps Fans Get Money Back from Ticket Companies",
  "summary": "Olivia Dean is a famous singer who spoke out against ticket companies like Ticketmaster and AXS. She said it was unfair that some people were selling tickets to her concerts for much more money than the original price. For example, tickets that should have cost around $70 were being sold for over $1,000. Olivia wrote a letter calling this practice disgusting and asked the companies to do better. As a result, Ticketmaster agreed to give some fans a refund for the extra money they paid and promised to limit high prices for future ticket sales. Olivia wants live music to be affordable for everyone, and she is happy that her actions are making a difference. This story shows how artists can stand up for their fans.",
