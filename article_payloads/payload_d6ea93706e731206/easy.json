  "title": "The 30% Rent Rule: Is It Still Useful Today?",
  "summary": "For many years, people have been told to spend no more than 30% of their money on rent when finding a home. This is called the 30% rule. But today, with high housing costs, experts are asking if this rule still works. A study shows that nearly two-thirds of renters struggle to afford rent. Some experts say the rule is helpful for most people, but it has limits. For very poor or very rich people, the rule might not make sense. The rule started long ago to help families budget, and it was used in government programs. Now, in expensive cities, it can be hard to follow this rule. Experts suggest that renters might need other strategies to manage their money better.",

    "The 30% rule is an old piece of advice that says people should not spend more than 30% of their income on rent. It was created to help families budget their money, especially during tough times like the Great Depression. Over time, the government used this rule in housing programs to decide how much help people needed. Today, with rents going up in many places, some people find it hard to stick to this rule. Experts study this to see if it still helps people afford homes without struggling to pay for other things like food or bills. Understanding this rule can help us think about how to make smart choices with our money."
