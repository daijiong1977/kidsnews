  "title": "A Pub Owner's Big Tax Problem",
  "summary": "Phil Thorley owns a small pub chain in England and is worried about new tax changes. Business rates are a tax on properties like pubs, and his costs will go up by £62,000 each year. The government said it would help small pubs by lowering taxes, but for Phil, most of his pubs will pay more. This is because the value used to calculate the tax has increased, and a discount from the Covid time is ending. Phil says this extra cost is hard for his business, which is already struggling. He fears it might lead to fewer jobs and could hurt pubs in the future. The article shows how government decisions affect small business owners.",

    "Business rates are taxes that businesses in the UK pay based on the value of their property. The government sets these rates to collect money for public services. In this article, changes to these rates are causing problems for a pub owner. Pubs are important places in communities where people socialize, and higher taxes can make it hard for them to stay open. Understanding taxes helps us see how government decisions affect everyday life and small businesses."
