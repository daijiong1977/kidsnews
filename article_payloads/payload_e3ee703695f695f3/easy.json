  "title": "More Workers Have No Set Hours Before New Rules",
  "summary": "A record number of workers, 1.23 million, are on zero-hours contracts in the UK. These contracts mean employers can hire people without promising any work hours, so workers might not know when they will work or how much money they will earn. Many young people aged 16 to 24 and women are on these contracts. The government plans to change this next year by making new rules to give workers guaranteed hours and more notice about their schedules. Some people think zero-hours contracts are good because they offer flexibility for students or parents, but others say they are unfair and make it hard for workers to plan their lives. The Work Foundation, a research group, says the government needs to act quickly to help these workers.",

    "Zero-hours contracts are jobs where employers hire people but do not promise any specific hours of work. This means workers might be called in only when needed, often with short notice, so they cannot plan their time or money easily. In the UK, many young people and women have these jobs. The government is making new rules to give workers more security by ensuring guaranteed hours and better notice about schedules. Some argue these contracts help with flexibility, but others say they are unfair because workers face uncertainty."
