  "title": "Record High in Zero-Hours Contracts as Labour Plans Regulatory Changes",
  "summary": "The number of workers on zero-hours contracts in the UK has reached a record high of 1.23 million as of December, according to analysis by the Work Foundation based on Office for National Statistics data. This represents an increase of 91,000 from the previous year, driven largely by a surge in 16-to-24-year-olds and workers not in full-time education. Zero-hours contracts allow employers to hire staff without guaranteeing work hours, offering flexibility but often leading to unpredictable schedules and income for employees. The Labour government, elected in 2024, has pledged to crack down on these contracts through the Employment Rights Act, which will introduce a right to guaranteed hours, reasonable notice of schedules, and compensation for cancelled shifts. Proponents argue that zero-hours contracts provide entry into the job market and adaptability for those with education or childcare needs, while critics highlight issues like financial instability and one-sided flexibility. The Work Foundation emphasizes the urgent need to finalize these measures, noting that young workers are five times more likely and women make up over half of those on such contracts. The changes are still under consultation but aim to address worker insecurity.",

    "Zero-hours contracts are a type of employment in the UK where workers are hired without any guaranteed hours, meaning they are only called in when employers need them, often with little advance notice. This system has grown in popularity, particularly among young people and women, leading to debates about worker rights and flexibility. The Labour government, elected in 2024, has proposed the Employment Rights Act to address concerns by introducing measures like guaranteed hours, reasonable schedule notice, and compensation for cancelled shifts. Supporters argue these contracts help people enter the workforce and manage other commitments, while critics point to issues like income instability and lack of planning ability. The Work Foundation, using data from the Office for National Statistics, highlights the urgent need for reform as the number of workers on such contracts hits record levels. This context is important for understanding the current labor market dynamics and policy responses."
