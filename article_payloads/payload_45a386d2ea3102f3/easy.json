  "title": "NASA Delays Moon Mission Due to Rocket Fuel Leaks",
  "summary": "NASA has delayed the Artemis II mission to March because of hydrogen leaks found during a test. The mission will send four astronauts around the Moon for the first time since 1972. During a practice countdown called a Wet Dress Rehearsal, engineers discovered hydrogen leaking from the rocket's fuel connection at Kennedy Space Center in Florida. Hydrogen is a super-cold fuel that is hard to handle because it can escape through tiny gaps. NASA needs to fix this leak to ensure safety before launch. The astronauts, including Reid Wiseman and Christina Koch, are now waiting in Houston for a new launch date. This delay gives NASA time to review data and conduct another test to solve the problem.",

    "NASA is planning to send astronauts back to the Moon with the Artemis program. Artemis II is the first crewed mission, which will fly around the Moon without landing. Hydrogen is used as rocket fuel because it is efficient, but it is very cold and can leak easily. NASA tests rockets carefully before launch to make sure everything is safe for the astronauts."
