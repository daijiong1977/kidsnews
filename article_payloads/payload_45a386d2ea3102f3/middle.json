  "title": "NASA Postpones Artemis II Lunar Mission Over Persistent Hydrogen Leak Issues",
  "summary": "NASA has postponed the Artemis II mission to March after a Wet Dress Rehearsal revealed hydrogen leaks in the Space Launch System (SLS) rocket at Kennedy Space Center. This mission, the first crewed lunar flight since 1972, aims to send four astronauts—commander Reid Wiseman, pilot Victor Glover, mission specialist Christina Koch, and Canadian astronaut Jeremy Hansen—on a loop around the Moon's far side. The test, conducted on Monday, identified leaks in the Tail Service Mast Umbilicals (TSMUs), which connect the rocket to ground fuel lines, similar to issues that delayed the Artemis I launch in 2022. Hydrogen, stored at minus 423°F, is challenging to handle due to its small molecules that can escape through tiny seals, exceeding safety limits during the rehearsal. NASA engineers attempted fixes by adjusting fuel flow and warming seals, but the leaks persisted, prompting a delay to review data and conduct another test. The astronauts, in quarantine since January 21, have been released to Houston to await a new launch date, with the first opportunity on March 6. This delay highlights the technical difficulties in managing cryogenic fuels for space exploration.",

    "The Artemis program is NASA's initiative to return humans to the Moon, with Artemis II as a critical step involving a crewed lunar flyby. Hydrogen is a common rocket fuel due to its high efficiency, but its cryogenic nature at minus 423°F makes it prone to leaks through seals, as seen in past missions like Artemis I. Wet Dress Rehearsals are standard pre-launch tests to simulate countdowns and identify technical issues, ensuring astronaut safety. The SLS rocket and Orion spacecraft represent advanced technology for deep space exploration, building on lessons from Apollo missions."
