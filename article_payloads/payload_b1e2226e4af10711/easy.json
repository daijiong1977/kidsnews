  "title": "How Soil Helps Forests Grow Back Faster",
  "summary": "Scientists discovered that tropical forests can grow back twice as fast after being cut down if the soil has enough nitrogen. They did a big experiment in Central America, watching 76 forest plots for up to 20 years. They added different nutrients like nitrogen and phosphorus to the soil to see what happened. They found that forests with nitrogen grew much faster in the first 10 years. This is important because forests help fight climate change by taking carbon from the air. The scientists suggest planting bean family trees or choosing areas with good soil to help forests without using fertilizer, which can be harmful. This research helps people understand how to make forests recover better.",

    "Forests are important for our planet because they provide homes for animals and help clean the air. Sometimes, forests are cut down for things like farming or building, which is called deforestation. When this happens, it can take a long time for new trees to grow back. Scientists are studying how to make forests recover faster to help the environment. Nutrients in the soil, like nitrogen, are like food for trees and can help them grow better. This article talks about a big experiment where scientists learned that nitrogen in soil makes tropical forests grow back twice as fast, which is good news for fighting climate change."
