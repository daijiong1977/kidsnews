  "title": "Diamonds with Special Powers",
  "summary": "Scientists at UC Santa Barbara have made a big discovery with diamonds. They used tiny parts inside diamonds called spins and made them work together in a special way called entanglement. This helps the diamonds sense things much better than before. It's like giving the diamonds super senses! This new technology can be used to make small and powerful sensors that help in many areas, like medicine or finding hidden objects. It's a cool step forward in using quantum science to make our world better.",

    "Quantum science is about studying tiny particles like atoms. Entanglement is when particles are linked and affect each other instantly, even far apart. Sensors are tools that detect things like temperature or magnetic fields. Diamonds are used because they have special properties that help in experiments. This discovery could lead to better medical devices or environmental monitors."
