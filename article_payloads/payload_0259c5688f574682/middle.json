    "Quantum mechanics deals with the behavior of particles at atomic scales, where entanglement allows particles to share states. Spins are quantum properties used in technologies like MRI. Diamond's nitrogen-vacancy centers make it ideal for quantum experiments due to long coherence times. Classical sensors have limits set by noise, but quantum methods like squeezing can beat these by exploiting quantum states. This research builds on years of work in quantum information science, aiming to apply theoretical concepts to tangible devices."
