  "title": "Making Green Hydrogen Better for Our Planet",
  "summary": "Green hydrogen is a clean fuel that can help us stop using dirty fossil fuels like oil and coal. But making it is expensive and can harm the environment because it uses bad chemicals called PFAS, which are 'forever chemicals' that don't break down. Scientists from Europe are working on a big project called SUPREME to fix this. They want to create a new way to make green hydrogen without PFAS and use less of a rare metal called iridium, which is very costly. This will make green hydrogen cheaper and safer. The project involves universities and companies from countries like Denmark, Austria, and Turkey. If they succeed, green hydrogen can be used more in industries like making steel and storing extra energy from wind and solar power, helping our planet become cleaner.",

    "Green hydrogen is a type of fuel made by splitting water into hydrogen and oxygen using electricity from renewable sources like wind or solar power. It's called 'green' because it doesn't produce pollution when made or used. Hydrogen is important for things like making steel, producing chemicals, and as a clean energy carrier. However, current methods to make it can be expensive and use harmful substances. The SUPREME project is a European effort to solve these problems by developing new technologies that are safer and more affordable, helping to fight climate change and protect our environment."
