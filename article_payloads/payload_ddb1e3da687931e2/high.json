  "title": "Advancing Green Hydrogen: Overcoming Economic and Environmental Barriers through Collaborative Research",
  "summary": "Green hydrogen is pivotal for global decarbonization efforts, yet its scalability is hindered by economic and environmental constraints. Proton exchange membrane (PEM) electrolysis, while compatible with intermittent renewable energy sources, remains costly and dependent on per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), which pose significant ecological and health risks due to their persistence. The SUPREME project, funded by the European Union through CETPartnership, aims to revolutionize hydrogen production by developing a PFAS-free electrolysis system over three years. This initiative, led by the University of Southern Denmark in collaboration with Graz University of Technology, TÜBITAK, and other partners, focuses on multiple fronts: evaluating PFAS-free material alternatives, engineering advanced microporous membranes, and substantially reducing iridium usage—a scarce and expensive platinum group metal—by up to 75%, coupled with recycling methods to recover 90% of residual iridium. By enhancing efficiency and sustainability, the project seeks to lower production costs, making green hydrogen competitive with fossil-based alternatives and facilitating its integration into heavy industries and renewable energy storage systems, thereby accelerating the transition to a low-carbon economy.",

    "Green hydrogen, produced via electrolysis powered by renewables, is central to strategies for reducing greenhouse gas emissions in hard-to-abate sectors like industry and transport. However, its development faces technical hurdles, including the use of PFAS—chemicals linked to environmental contamination and health issues—and reliance on iridium, a rare metal with supply chain vulnerabilities. The SUPREME project exemplifies interdisciplinary collaboration in material science and engineering, aiming to innovate beyond current PEM electrolysis limitations. This context underscores the importance of sustainable innovation in achieving climate goals, highlighting the interplay between policy, funding, and research in driving the clean energy transition. Understanding these elements is crucial for assessing the feasibility and impact of green hydrogen in a low-carbon future."
