  "title": "Innovating Green Hydrogen: Tackling Costs and Chemicals",
  "summary": "Green hydrogen is considered essential for transitioning away from fossil fuels, but its production faces significant challenges in cost and environmental impact. Current methods, such as PEM (proton exchange membrane) electrolysis, are expensive and rely on PFAS (per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances), known as 'forever chemicals' due to their persistence and health risks. The EU-funded SUPREME project aims to address these issues over three years by developing a PFAS-free electrolysis system that is more efficient and reduces the use of critical raw materials like iridium. Led by the University of Southern Denmark and involving partners like Graz University of Technology and TÜBITAK, the project focuses on evaluating alternative materials, creating new membranes, and cutting iridium use by up to 75% while improving recycling. This effort seeks to make green hydrogen more affordable and sustainable, potentially accelerating its adoption in industries such as steel production and as a storage solution for renewable energy surpluses.",

    "Green hydrogen is produced via electrolysis, where water is split into hydrogen and oxygen using electricity, ideally from renewable sources like wind or solar. It's a key component in decarbonizing sectors such as industry and transportation, but challenges include high costs due to materials like iridium and environmental issues from PFAS chemicals. The SUPREME project represents a collaborative European effort to innovate in this field, focusing on material science and engineering to create more sustainable production methods. Understanding this context helps grasp the importance of transitioning to clean energy and the technological hurdles involved in making green hydrogen viable on a large scale."
