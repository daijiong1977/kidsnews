  "title": "Ice and Algae in Antarctica",
  "summary": "Scientists studied ice in Antarctica and found something surprising. When ice melts, it sends iron into the ocean. Iron usually helps tiny plants called algae grow, which take in carbon dioxide, a gas that warms the Earth. But in this study, more iron did not make more algae grow. This happened because the iron from the ice was old and changed, so algae could not use it well. If Antarctica keeps losing ice, the ocean might not take in as much carbon dioxide, which could make Earth warmer. The research used a long tube of mud from the ocean floor to learn about the past.",

    "Antarctica is a cold continent covered in ice. When ice melts, it can affect the ocean and Earth's climate. Algae are small plants in the water that help clean the air by taking in carbon dioxide. Iron is like food for algae, but sometimes it does not work if it is too old. Scientists use special tools to study mud from the ocean to understand how things changed long ago."
