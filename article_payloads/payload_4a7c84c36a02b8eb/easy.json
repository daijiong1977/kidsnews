  "title": "Sir Elton John Says Press Snooping on His Baby Was Wrong",
  "summary": "Sir Elton John is a famous singer who is very upset because a newspaper called the Daily Mail looked into his private life without permission. He says they found out about his health problems and the birth of his son, Zachary, which he thinks is not fair or nice. Sir Elton and his husband, David Furnish, are in court with other people like Prince Harry to sue the newspaper for invading their privacy. They feel angry and hurt because they did not know this was happening. The newspaper says they did nothing wrong. Sir Elton told the court that everyone should have the right to keep personal things private, and he wants to stop this from happening to others.",
