  "title": "The Truth About How Many Food Choices We Make",
  "summary": "Have you ever heard that people make over 200 food choices every day? Scientists say this number might not be true. A researcher named Maria Almudena Claassen and her team studied this idea. They found that the number 200 comes from an old study where people were asked many small questions about food, like what to eat and when. When you add up all these small answers, it makes the number seem bigger than it really is. This is called the subadditivity effect. The scientists warn that believing we make so many choices without thinking can make us feel like we have less control over our eating. They say people are actually good at making smart food decisions when they focus on their goals, like eating healthy or being kind to the planet. It's important to use good science to understand how we choose our food.",

    "This article talks about a common idea in health messages: that people make over 200 food choices every day without realizing it. Scientists have looked into this claim and found it might not be accurate. They explain that the number comes from a study where participants answered many detailed questions about their eating habits, which inflated the total. This is due to a cognitive bias called the subadditivity effect. The researchers warn that such exaggerated numbers can make people feel they have little control over their food decisions, but in reality, we are capable of making conscious choices based on personal goals like health or sustainability. Understanding this helps us rely on better science for healthy eating."
