  "title": "Eating at Certain Times Helps People with Crohn's Disease Feel Better",
  "summary": "A new study found that eating all meals in an 8-hour window each day can help adults with Crohn's disease, a stomach problem, feel much better. People who tried this eating schedule had less stomach pain and their disease got 40% better in 12 weeks. They also lost some weight and had less inflammation in their bodies, which is good for health. The study was done by doctors at a university and funded by a foundation that helps people with Crohn's disease. It shows that when you eat might be as important as what you eat for managing this condition. However, people should talk to their doctor before changing how they eat.",

    "Crohn's disease is a condition where the digestive system gets inflamed, causing belly pain, diarrhea, and tiredness. It affects many people and can make daily life hard. Eating habits, like when and what we eat, might help manage it. This study looked at a simple change: eating only during 8 hours a day to see if it reduces symptoms."
