  "title": "Time-Restricted Eating Reduces Crohn's Disease Symptoms in Study",
  "summary": "A randomized controlled trial funded by the Crohn's & Colitis Foundation discovered that time-restricted feeding, where meals are limited to an 8-hour daily window, significantly decreased disease activity and inflammation in adults with Crohn's disease who had overweight or obesity. Conducted by researchers at the University of Calgary, the 12-week study involved 35 participants and showed a 40% reduction in Crohn's disease activity and a 50% cut in abdominal discomfort compared to a control group. Participants following this intermittent fasting schedule lost about 5.5 pounds on average, while the control group gained weight, and blood tests indicated improved inflammation markers like leptin and PAI-1 without calorie restriction. The findings, published in Gastroenterology, suggest that meal timing may play a key role in digestive and immune health, offering a potential tool for managing Crohn's disease alongside medications. However, researchers caution that larger studies are needed to confirm long-term safety and effectiveness, and individuals should consult healthcare providers before making dietary changes.",

    "Crohn's disease is a chronic inflammatory bowel disease that causes abdominal pain, diarrhea, and fatigue, often requiring medication and lifestyle adjustments. Time-restricted feeding is a form of intermittent fasting gaining attention for potential health benefits like weight loss and reduced inflammation. This study builds on previous research by exploring its effects specifically in Crohn's disease patients with overweight, highlighting how meal timing might influence gut health and immune function without requiring dietary changes."

    "Main Points: The study found time-restricted feeding reduced Crohn's disease activity by 40% and abdominal discomfort by 50% in 12 weeks, with weight loss and improved inflammation markers. Purpose: To investigate if meal timing can help manage Crohn's disease symptoms and overall health. Evidence Evaluation: High-quality evidence from a randomized controlled trial with blood tests and clinical assessments, though sample size was small. Author Credibility: Researchers from the University of Calgary with medical expertise, funded by the Crohn's & Colitis Foundation. Methodology: 35 adults with Crohn's disease were randomly assigned to an 8-hour eating window or control group, with evaluations at start and end."
