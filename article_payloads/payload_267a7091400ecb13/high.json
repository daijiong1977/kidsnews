    "The World Economic Forum serves as a nexus for global elite discourse, where Trump's populist rhetoric often clashes with traditional diplomatic norms. His proposal to buy Greenland reflects historical US expansionist tendencies and current strategic interests in the Arctic. Tariffs are part of his 'America First' agenda, impacting transatlantic relations. In Venezuela, the US-led ouster of Maduro exemplifies regime change driven by resource control, amid ongoing humanitarian crises. Iran tensions highlight broader Middle East power struggles. The BBC's multiperspectival reporting, while credible, may prioritize brevity over depth, typical of news video formats. Understanding these contexts requires knowledge of international relations, economic theory, and media analysis techniques."
