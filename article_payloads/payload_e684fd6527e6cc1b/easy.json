  "title": "A Very Busy Christmas Eve for Travel in the UK",
  "summary": "This article talks about how Christmas Eve in the UK is going to be super busy for travel. The Civil Aviation Authority says more people than ever before will fly on this day, with over 335,000 passengers expected at airports. That's 5% more than last year. Roads will also be very crowded, especially from 1pm to 7pm, as many people drive home for Christmas. Airports like Manchester and Heathrow are preparing for lots of flights and passengers. Some trains won't run on Christmas Day, so more people might drive, making roads even busier. Experts say this could be the busiest travel time since records started.",
