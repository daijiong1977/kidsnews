  "title": "Record-Breaking Christmas Eve Travel in the UK: Air and Road Congestion",
  "summary": "This article reports that Christmas Eve in the UK is set to be the busiest for travel since records began in 1972, according to the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA). Over 335,000 passengers are projected to fly, a 5% increase from the previous year, with minimal disruption expected. Airports like Manchester anticipate around 75,000 passengers and 208 flights, while Heathrow expects its busiest December ever, including 152,000 passengers on Christmas Day. On the roads, the RAC warns of heavy congestion from 1pm to 7pm, with particular delays on the M25 and M5, as millions drive home for the holidays. Rail travel is limited due to maintenance and reduced services over Christmas, potentially increasing road traffic. The RAC notes that this getaway period may be the busiest since 2013, attributed to workers using annual leave at the last minute. Overall, the article highlights the peak travel demands during the festive season across multiple transport modes.",

    "The festive season in the UK, particularly around Christmas, sees a significant surge in travel as people visit family and friends. The Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) and RAC are key organizations that monitor and report on transport trends, using historical data to make projections. Airports and roads experience peak demands during this time, often leading to congestion. Maintenance work on railways during holidays can reduce train services, shifting more travelers to roads. Understanding these dynamics helps in planning and managing transport infrastructure to handle increased loads."
