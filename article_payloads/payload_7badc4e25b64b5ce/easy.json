  "title": "Scientists Make a New Molecule After 50 Years of Trying",
  "summary": "Scientists have made a special molecule after trying for 50 years. A team led by Professor David Scheschkewitz at Saarland University, with help from Ankur and Bernd Morgenstern, created a new molecule called pentasilacyclopentadienide. This molecule is like a ring made of silicon atoms instead of carbon atoms. Aromatic molecules are very stable and important in making things like plastics. By using silicon, which is different from carbon, scientists hope to make new materials and better catalysts for factories. This discovery was published in a famous science journal called Science, and another group in Japan made the same molecule at the same time. It opens doors for new inventions in chemistry.",

    "Chemistry is the study of substances and how they change. Molecules are tiny parts made of atoms like carbon or silicon. Aromatic molecules are special because they are very stable and often have nice smells, which is why they were named after aromas. Scientists work in teams to discover new things that can help make better products, like plastics in factories. This story shows how patience and teamwork can lead to big discoveries after many years."
