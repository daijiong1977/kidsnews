  "title": "Geothermal Energy Gets a Boost in Massachusetts",
  "summary": "A special project in Massachusetts is getting bigger to help heat and cool buildings using energy from the ground. The U.S. government gave $8.6 million to expand a geothermal network in Framingham, which uses pipes underground to move warm or cool water to homes and businesses. This system is very efficient and can save energy. Even though the Trump administration has cut some clean energy funding, this project got support because geothermal energy is liked by both political parties. The expansion will add about 140 new customers and cost less than the first part. People like the mayor and energy experts say it helps make energy local and independent. This shows that geothermal energy is important for the future.",

    "Geothermal energy comes from heat deep in the Earth and can be used to warm or cool buildings without burning fuels. In Framingham, Massachusetts, a project uses pipes underground to move water and help heat pumps work better. This is good for the environment and saves energy. The U.S. government sometimes gives money for such projects, and this one got support even when other clean energy funds were cut. Learning about renewable energy helps us understand how to protect our planet."
