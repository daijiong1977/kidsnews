  "title": "How Our Brain Remembers Things in a New Way",
  "summary": "Scientists have discovered something surprising about how our brain remembers things. They found that when we remember personal stories from our past or facts we know, like what a brand logo means, the same parts of the brain light up. This means our brain might not use separate areas for different types of memories, which could change how we think about memory. The study was done by researchers from universities in Nottingham and Cambridge using a special brain scan called fMRI that shows which parts of the brain are active. They tested 40 people by having them remember logos and brand names. The results could help us understand memory problems like dementia better by showing that the whole brain is involved in remembering.",

    "Memory is how our brain stores and recalls information. There are different types, like remembering a birthday party (episodic memory) or knowing that the sun is a star (semantic memory). Scientists study memory to help people with brain diseases. Brain scans like fMRI let researchers see which parts of the brain are active when we think or remember things."
