  "title": "Doctors' Strike During Flu Outbreak",
  "summary": "Sir Keir Starmer, the prime minister, says it is very risky for doctors to go on strike next week because many people are sick with the flu. The flu is spreading fast in the UK, with more people in hospitals than usual for this time of year. Doctors are planning a five-day strike to ask for better pay and working conditions. Sir Keir wants them to cancel the strike to keep patients safe. The doctors' union is asking its members if they will stop the strike after the government made a new offer. If they vote no, the strike will start on Wednesday. The flu is not more severe this year, but it is affecting many children and young people.",

    "In the UK, doctors work in the NHS to help sick people. Sometimes, doctors go on strike, which means they stop working to ask for better pay or working conditions. This can be a problem if many people are sick, like during a flu outbreak. The flu is a common illness that spreads easily, especially in winter. It can make people very sick, and hospitals get busy. Leaders like the prime minister try to keep everyone safe by asking doctors not to strike during such times."
