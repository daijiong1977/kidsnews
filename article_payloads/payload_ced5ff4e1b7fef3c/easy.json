  "title": "Stone Age Dogs: How They Changed Long Ago",
  "summary": "Scientists have discovered that dogs started to look different a very long time ago, during the Stone Age. This means that the way dogs look today, with all their shapes and sizes, began much earlier than we used to think. By studying old bones and fossils, researchers found that early dogs were already changing in size and shape. This helps us understand how dogs evolved from wolves and became our best friends. It's exciting because it shows that dogs have been diverse for thousands of years, not just recently. This study used science to look back in time and learn about our furry companions.",

    "Dogs are animals that have been friends with humans for a very long time. They come in all sizes, from tiny Chihuahuas to big Great Danes. Scientists study how dogs changed over history by looking at old remains. The Stone Age was a period thousands of years ago when early humans lived and used simple tools. This new study helps us see that dogs started to become diverse much earlier, which is exciting for learning about animal history."
