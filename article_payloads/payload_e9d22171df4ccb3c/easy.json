  "title": "NASA's New Helper for Finding Alien Worlds",
  "summary": "NASA has launched a new mission called Pandora to help the James Webb Space Telescope find planets like Earth. The Webb telescope is a big space telescope that looks at faraway stars and planets to see if they might have life. It can detect chemicals like water vapor in planet atmospheres. But stars are very bright and have spots and flares that can make it hard to see the planets clearly. Pandora is a small, cheaper satellite that will watch the stars at the same time as Webb. This helps scientists tell if the chemicals they see are from the planet or the star. Pandora launched on a SpaceX rocket and will work from space to make Webb's discoveries more accurate. This mission helps us learn about other worlds and if they could support life.",
