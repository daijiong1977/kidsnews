  "title": "Addressing Stellar Contamination: NASA's Pandora Mission as a Calibrative Tool for the James Webb Space Telescope in Exoplanet Atmospheric Spectroscopy",
  "summary": "NASA's Pandora mission, launched in early 2026, serves as a critical calibrative instrument to mitigate stellar contamination issues affecting the James Webb Space Telescope's exoplanet atmospheric studies. Webb, with its unprecedented sensitivity, employs transit spectroscopy to detect molecular signatures such as water vapor, carbon dioxide, and methane in exoplanet atmospheres, aiming to identify potentially habitable Earth-like worlds. However, stellar variability—including photospheric spots, chromospheric flares, and intrinsic atmospheric molecules—introduces signal contamination that obscures planetary data, a problem recognized as severe by the astronomical community around 2017-2018. Pandora, a small satellite deployed into a polar Sun-synchronous orbit via a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket, will conduct simultaneous stellar observations to characterize and correct for this interference. With a constrained budget of $20 million versus Webb's $10 billion, Pandora exemplifies a cost-effective approach to enhancing data fidelity. Scientists like Daniel Apai and Tom Barclay highlight that this mission reduces uncertainties in spectral analysis, ensuring more reliable assessments of biosignatures and advancing the search for extraterrestrial habitats. This collaboration underscores the integration of complementary technologies in modern astrophysics to address complex observational challenges.",
