  "title": "Enhancing Exoplanet Discovery: NASA's Pandora Mission Supports Webb Telescope",
  "summary": "NASA has launched the Pandora mission to address a critical challenge in exoplanet research with the James Webb Space Telescope. Webb, launched in 2021, is designed to analyze the atmospheres of distant planets by detecting chemical signatures like water vapor, carbon dioxide, and methane during planetary transits. However, stellar variability—such as spots, flares, and atmospheric molecules on stars—can contaminate these signals, making it difficult to distinguish planetary features from stellar ones. This issue became prominent around 2017-2018 as telescope capabilities improved. Pandora, a small satellite launched aboard a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket, will observe stars simultaneously with Webb to monitor their activity and provide corrective data. With a budget of $20 million compared to Webb's over $10 billion, Pandora aims to enhance the accuracy of Webb's findings, particularly in the search for Earth-like exoplanets. Scientists like Daniel Apai and Tom Barclay emphasize that this collaboration will reduce uncertainties and improve our understanding of potentially habitable worlds.",

    "The James Webb Space Telescope represents a major advancement in astronomy, capable of observing the earliest galaxies and analyzing exoplanet atmospheres. Exoplanet research focuses on finding habitable worlds by detecting biosignatures like water vapor. Stellar activity, including spots and flares, can mimic these signatures, leading to false positives. NASA's smaller missions, such as Pandora, complement large observatories by providing targeted data to improve accuracy. Understanding these challenges helps in the broader search for extraterrestrial life and planetary science."
