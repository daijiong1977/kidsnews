  "title": "A Small Earthquake Shakes Homes in England",
  "summary": "A small earthquake happened in north-west England on Wednesday night. It was a 3.3-magnitude quake, which means it was not very strong but could be felt. People in towns like Kendal and Ulverston felt their houses shake and heard loud rumbling sounds. Nikki Maddox, who lives in Silverdale, thought her roof was falling down! The earthquake lasted about 20 seconds and scared many people. Katrina Simmons woke up because her bed was shaking. Luckily, no one was hurt, and there was no damage to buildings. Earthquakes are rare in England, so this was a surprising event for everyone.",

    "Earthquakes happen when rocks underground move and release energy, causing the ground to shake. They are measured on a scale called magnitude, where higher numbers mean stronger quakes. In England, earthquakes are rare and usually small, so people might not expect them. This article talks about a recent small earthquake that surprised residents in north-west England."
