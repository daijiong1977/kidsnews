  "title": "Scientists Teleport Information with Light",
  "summary": "Scientists have made a big step in making the internet safer by teleporting information using light. This is part of something called quantum communication, which uses tiny particles called photons to send messages securely. A team at the University of Stuttgart worked with quantum dots, which are like tiny sources of light, to send information between photons from different places. This helps in building a quantum internet that can protect data from hackers. Quantum teleportation lets information move without being copied, so no one can sneak a peek. The scientists used special devices to make the photons match perfectly. This discovery could lead to better ways to keep our online information safe in the future.",

    "Quantum physics is a branch of science that studies very small particles like atoms and photons. It helps explain how things work at tiny scales. In communication, we usually send data as zeros and ones, but quantum communication uses photons to make it super secure. This is important because hackers can steal information online. Scientists are trying to build a quantum internet that uses light to protect messages. The recent discovery by researchers in Germany shows how information can be teleported between photons from different sources, which is a big step toward making this secure internet a reality."
