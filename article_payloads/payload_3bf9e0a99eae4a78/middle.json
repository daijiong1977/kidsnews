  "title": "Uncovering a Massive Medieval Cog Shipwreck in Denmark",
  "summary": "Archaeologists have uncovered a supersized medieval shipwreck off the Danish coast, dating to around 1410 CE, which provides new insights into medieval European trade and maritime life. The ship, named Svaelget 2, is a cog—a type of merchant vessel characterized by its wide, flat-bottomed design and single square sail. Remarkably, it measures 28 meters long and 9 meters wide, capable of carrying 300 tons of cargo, significantly larger than typical cogs of 15-25 meters. This discovery, made during a seabed survey for a Copenhagen construction project, indicates the rapid economic growth of medieval Europe, as such large ships required substantial investment and reflected expanding trade networks. The wreck was well-preserved by sand layers, allowing archaeologists to examine rare features like rigging, a galley, and a stern castle, which are usually lost to decay. Artifacts such as combs, shoes, and rosary beads offer glimpses into the lives of the 30-45 crew members. The ship's construction involved timber from the Netherlands and oak planks from Poland, highlighting the interconnected trade routes of the time. Overall, this find underscores the cog's role in revolutionizing northern European trade by enabling large-scale transport of goods.",

    "This article discusses the discovery of a large medieval cog shipwreck in Denmark, dating to the early 1400s. During the medieval period, Europe experienced significant economic expansion, driven by trade networks that connected regions like the Netherlands and Poland. Cogs were key vessels in this trade, designed for carrying bulk goods such as grain or cloth. Archaeologists use techniques like tree-ring dating to analyze wooden artifacts, helping date wrecks accurately. The preservation of shipwrecks often depends on environmental factors like sand burial, which can protect structures from decay. This find is notable because it offers rare insights into ship features like stern castles, typically lost over time, and personal artifacts that humanize historical sailors. Understanding such discoveries helps reconstruct maritime history and the socio-economic dynamics of medieval Europe."
