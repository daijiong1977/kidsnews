  "title": "A Giant Old Ship Found Underwater in Denmark",
  "summary": "Archaeologists in Denmark have discovered a huge old shipwreck from the medieval times, around the year 1410. The ship, called Svaelget 2, was a type of cargo ship known as a cog, used for trading goods across the sea. It was much bigger than most ships of its time, measuring about 28 meters long and 9 meters wide, and could carry about 300 tons of cargo. This shows that medieval Europe was growing rich and trading a lot. The ship was found half-buried in sand, which helped protect it from damage over 600 years. Archaeologists found cool things like ropes, combs, shoes, and rosary beads, giving clues about the sailors' lives. This discovery helps us learn more about how people traded and lived long ago.",

    "This article is about a big old ship found underwater in Denmark. In medieval times, around 600 years ago, people in Europe traded goods like food and cloth using ships called cogs. These ships helped countries grow richer by moving things from one place to another. Archaeologists are scientists who dig up old things to learn about history. Finding a shipwreck like this helps us understand how people lived and worked back then. The ship was protected by sand, which kept it from rotting away, so we can see parts like ropes and personal items left by sailors."
