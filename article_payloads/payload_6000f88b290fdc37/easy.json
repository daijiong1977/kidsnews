  "title": "Why Some People Get Sick from Colds and Others Don't",
  "summary": "This article explains why some people get bad colds while others don't. It talks about a virus called rhinovirus that causes colds. When this virus enters the nose, the cells there work together to fight it. They use proteins called interferons to stop the virus from spreading. If the cells react quickly with interferons, the person might not get sick or have mild symptoms. If the response is slow, the virus can spread and cause more sickness. Scientists studied this using a lab-grown model of human nasal tissue, which helped them see how cells respond. They found that the body's early reaction is very important in deciding if someone gets a cold and how bad it feels. This research could help make better treatments for colds in the future.",

    "Colds are common illnesses caused by viruses like rhinovirus. When you catch a cold, it starts in your nose where tiny cells try to protect you. Scientists study how these cells work to understand why some people get sicker than others. They use models made in labs to see what happens inside the nose without hurting anyone. This helps them learn how to make better medicines to help people feel better when they have colds."
