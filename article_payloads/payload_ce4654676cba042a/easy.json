  "title": "Biffy Clyro's US Tour Delay Due to Visa Mistake",
  "summary": "Biffy Clyro, a Scottish rock band, had to delay their US tour because of a visa problem. The tour was supposed to start in December to promote their new album Futique, but a mistake in the visa application meant the start date was wrong. Singer Simon Neil explained that the visa doesn't begin until after the tour was planned to end, making them very angry. They tried to fix it with lawyers and government officials, but nothing worked. The tour is now rescheduled for 2026, and fans can keep their tickets or get refunds. Neil apologized to fans who might have spent money on travel. This isn't the first time they've had issues in the US; in 2022, a show was canceled due to Covid. Despite this, the band is still popular and has big plans, like headlining a show in London in 2026.",
