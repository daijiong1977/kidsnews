  "title": "Visa Mishap Forces Biffy Clyro to Postpone US Tour",
  "summary": "Biffy Clyro, a prominent Scottish rock band, has postponed their upcoming US tour due to a critical administrative error in their work visas. The tour, scheduled to begin on December 2nd, was intended to support their 10th album Futique, which recently topped the UK charts. Singer Simon Neil revealed in an Instagram video that the visas incorrectly listed a start date after the tour's conclusion, rendering them unusable. He expressed anger and frustration, noting that consultations with immigration lawyers and congressional contacts yielded no solutions. The band has rescheduled the tour for April or May 2026 and assured fans that existing tickets will be honored, though Neil apologized for any financial losses from pre-booked travel. This incident isn't isolated; in 2022, they canceled a US show due to Neil contracting Covid. Despite these setbacks, Biffy Clyro remains successful, with multiple top-charting albums and a major headline show announced for London's Finsbury Park in 2026, underscoring their resilience in the music industry.",
