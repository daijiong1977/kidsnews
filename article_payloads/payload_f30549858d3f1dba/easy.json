  "title": "A Governor's Big Speech After the President",
  "summary": "Governor Abigail Spanberger from Virginia will give a speech after President Trump talks to the country. This is called the Democratic response to the State of the Union. She is the first woman governor in Virginia and won her election by a lot. Her speech will talk about making things cheaper for families, protecting healthcare, and defending freedoms. It will happen on Tuesday night and you can watch it live. Other politicians have given similar speeches in the past, and sometimes people remember them or make fun of them. This is an important job in politics because it lets Democrats share their ideas.",
