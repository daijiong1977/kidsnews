  "title": "Radio Station Cleared by Regulator After Swearing Incident",
  "summary": "Horizon Radio, a community station in Milton Keynes, faced an incident where its broadcast was hijacked, resulting in a loop of expletives being aired for at least 26 minutes during an evening show at 18:00 BST. Ofcom, the UK communications regulator, investigated after receiving complaints from three listeners. The station reported that a third-party stream provider caused the issue, possibly due to a contractual dispute, and that their website and app were not affected. Horizon Radio's managing director heard the broadcast while driving and immediately attempted to halt the transmission, with multiple requests made to the provider. Ofcom concluded that the station took swift action to minimize the impact, including broadcasting an apology within an hour, and cleared them of wrongdoing, noting they did everything in their control. The correct service was restored by 18:50 BST, and the regulator emphasized that children were likely listening, but the station's efforts were sufficient.",
