  "title": "Radio Station Cleared After Bad Words Played by Mistake",
  "summary": "A radio station called Horizon Radio had a problem when someone else took over their broadcast and played bad words on a loop for 26 minutes. This happened in Milton Keynes during an evening show at 6 PM, when kids might be listening. Ofcom, the group that checks radio stations, looked into it. Horizon Radio tried many times to stop the bad words and said sorry to listeners. Ofcom decided that Horizon Radio did everything they could to fix the mistake and did not get in trouble. The station explained that the problem was caused by a company they work with, not by them. They quickly got their normal show back on the air.",
