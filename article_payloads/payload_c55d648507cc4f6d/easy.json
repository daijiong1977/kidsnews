  "title": "Britain's New Rules for Calling Up Former Soldiers",
  "summary": "The government in Britain is making new rules to help call up former soldiers more easily if there is a war. These soldiers are called reservists, and they used to serve in the armed forces. The new rules mean they can be called up for ten more years, until they are 65 years old instead of 55. Also, it will be easier to call them up. Before, they were only called if there was a big emergency or attack in the UK. Now, they can be called if the country is preparing for war. The government says there are about 95,000 of these reservists. The rules need to be approved by parliament and will start next year. This is part of making sure Britain is ready for any conflict.",

    "In Britain, the armed forces include soldiers, sailors, and pilots who protect the country. Some people who used to serve in the armed forces are called reservists. They are like backup soldiers who can be called to help if there is a big problem, like a war. The government makes rules about when and how to call them up. These new rules are being made to make sure Britain is ready if there is a conflict. It's important for countries to have plans to keep people safe."
