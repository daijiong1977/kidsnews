  "title": "A Girl Named Sara and a Big Mistake",
  "summary": "This article tells a sad story about a girl named Sara Sharif who was hurt and died. Before this happened, some people from the council, who are supposed to help keep children safe, went to the wrong house to check on her. A review, which is like a big check-up, found that the system did not work well to protect Sara. It also said that sometimes, because of race, people might not report when a child is in danger. This means that everyone needs to work together to make sure children are safe and that no one is afraid to speak up if they see something wrong. It's important to learn from this so that other children can be protected better in the future.",

    "This article is about a serious event where a child named Sara Sharif was murdered. Before her death, the local council, which is responsible for child protection, made a mistake by visiting the wrong home when they were supposed to check on her. A review was done to understand what went wrong, and it found that the system designed to protect children did not work properly. It also highlighted that race can sometimes stop people from reporting possible child abuse. This shows how important it is for communities to ensure that all children are safe and that everyone feels comfortable speaking up about concerns."
