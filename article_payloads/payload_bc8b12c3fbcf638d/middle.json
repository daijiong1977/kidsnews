  "title": "Harry and Meghan's Humanitarian Mission to Jordan for Refugee Support",
  "summary": "Prince Harry and Meghan, the Duke and Duchess of Sussex, have embarked on their first international trip together in 18 months, arriving in Jordan to address the needs of refugees and vulnerable communities. Invited by Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the director-general of the World Health Organization (WHO), they are spending two days in Amman. Their visit includes participating in a roundtable discussion with representatives from the United Nations, diplomatic bodies, and donors, as well as meeting Jordanian leaders and senior health officials. They plan to engage with WHO teams, visit front-line health and mental health programs, and interact with World Central Kitchen staff coordinating food relief for Gaza. Additionally, they will visit Questscope's youth centre to hear from young people in creative and wellbeing programs. The couple's Archewell Foundation has contributed significant funds, including $500,000 in grants to support projects such as medical evacuations for children from Gaza to Jordan and developing prosthetic limbs for children affected by conflicts in Gaza and Ukraine. This trip highlights their ongoing commitment to humanitarian causes amid personal and royal family challenges.",

    "Harry and Meghan stepped down as working royals in 2020 and now focus on humanitarian work through their Archewell Foundation. Refugees often face challenges like lack of access to health care, food, and safe housing, especially in conflict zones like Gaza and Ukraine. The World Health Organization plays a key role in global health crises, coordinating medical responses and support. Jordan hosts many refugees from neighboring conflicts and works with international agencies to provide aid. Humanitarian missions involve assessing needs, funding projects, and raising awareness to help vulnerable populations."
