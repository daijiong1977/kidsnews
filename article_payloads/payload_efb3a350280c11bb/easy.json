  "title": "Royal Christmas Cards Show Family Love",
  "summary": "This article talks about Christmas cards from royal families in Europe. Many cards this year show families hugging, holding hands, and being close to each other. For example, the Prince and Princess of Wales have a card with their family sitting on grass in jeans, looking happy and relaxed. King Charles and Queen Camilla are arm in arm in their card, showing unity. Prince Harry and Meghan have a card with snow and them holding hands. The cards are different from old ones that were more formal and stiff. They make the royals seem like regular families who love each other, which is a nice message for Christmas.",
