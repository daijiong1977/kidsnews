  "title": "Unveiling the Mysteries of a Black Hole's Delayed Energy Bursts",
  "summary": "Astronomers have been monitoring a tidal disruption event (TDE) known as AT2018hyz, nicknamed Jetty McJetface, which involves a black hole tearing apart a star. Initially discovered in 2018, this event faded but unexpectedly reanimated in 2022, emitting bright radio waves. Since then, the brightness has increased 50-fold and continues to grow, with predictions that it might peak in 2027. The energy emitted is compared to the fictional Death Star from Star Wars, but Jetty's emissions are trillions of times more powerful. This phenomenon challenges the common misconception that black holes simply suck in matter; instead, they can eject part of a star's mass in powerful jets. The delayed outflow was likely missed initially because the jet might not have been aimed at Earth. Researchers, led by astrophysicist Yvette Cendes, are now searching for similar TDEs, suggesting that delayed outflows are more common than previously thought, offering new insights into black hole behavior and cosmic events.",

    "Black holes are regions in space with immense gravity, formed from collapsed stars. When a star ventures too close, it undergoes a tidal disruption event, where gravitational forces stretch and tear it apart. Some material forms an accretion disk, emitting radiation, while jets of matter are ejected. Astronomers use radio telescopes like the Very Large Array to detect these emissions. The study of TDEs helps understand black hole dynamics and cosmic evolution. Jetty McJetface's delayed outburst challenges previous assumptions, indicating that such events might be more frequent, prompting renewed research in astrophysics."
