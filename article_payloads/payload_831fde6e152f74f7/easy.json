  "title": "A Black Hole That Burps Like a Star Wars Spaceship",
  "summary": "Astronomers found a black hole named Jetty McJetface that is doing something surprising. It is burping out bright energy like the Death Star from Star Wars, but much stronger. This happened after a star got too close and was torn apart by the black hole's gravity. At first, scientists didn't see the burps, but years later, the black hole started shining brightly again. They think it might keep getting brighter until 2027. This helps scientists learn that black holes can have delayed burps, which they didn't know before. They are now looking for more black holes that act like Jetty to understand space better.",

    "Black holes are mysterious objects in space with gravity so strong that nothing, not even light, can escape if it gets too close. Sometimes, when a star comes near, it gets pulled apart, and some material is thrown out as bright energy. Scientists use telescopes to watch these events and learn about how black holes work. This story is about a special black hole that surprised astronomers by burping energy years later, showing that space can have unexpected surprises."
