  "title": "Cancer Deaths Near Nuclear Power Plants: A Big Study",
  "summary": "A big study from Harvard looked at cancer deaths in the United States. It found that counties closer to nuclear power plants have more people dying from cancer than counties farther away. The study checked data from 2000 to 2018 for all U.S. counties and nuclear plants. The researchers say this doesn't prove the plants cause cancer, but it shows we need to learn more. They think about 115,000 cancer deaths might be linked to living near these plants over the years. The study also considered things like income and smoking to make sure the results are fair. The authors want more studies to understand this better, especially as nuclear power is used more for clean energy.",

    "This study helps us learn about health near nuclear power plants. Nuclear power is used to make electricity without burning fossil fuels, which can help fight climate change. But some people worry it might be unsafe. Cancer is a disease that can be caused by many things like radiation, smoking, or genetics. Researchers at Harvard did this big study to see if living close to nuclear plants affects cancer deaths. They looked at data from all over the U.S. and tried to be fair by checking other factors. It's important because it tells us we need to study this more to keep people safe."
