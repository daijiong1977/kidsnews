  "title": "A Tiny Chip for Future Computers",
  "summary": "Scientists have made a very small chip that could help build powerful quantum computers. This chip is thinner than a hair and controls laser light precisely. Quantum computers use qubits to store information, and lasers are needed to work with these qubits. The new chip makes it easier to control lasers, which is important for making quantum computers bigger and better. It is made using methods like those for regular computer chips, so it can be produced in large numbers cheaply. This helps because current devices are big and hard to scale up. The chip also uses less power and creates less heat, allowing more qubits to fit together. This research was done by a team including Jake Freedman and Matt Eichenfield, working with Sandia National Laboratories.",

    "Quantum computers are a new type of computer that can solve problems much faster than regular computers by using qubits. Lasers are beams of light that scientists use to control these qubits, similar to how you might use a remote control for a toy. Making things small and efficient helps build better technology, just like how smartphones got smaller and more powerful over time. This chip is a step toward making quantum computers practical for everyday use in the future."
