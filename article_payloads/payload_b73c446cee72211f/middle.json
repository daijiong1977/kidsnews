  "title": "Advancing Quantum Computing with a Scalable Optical Chip",
  "summary": "Researchers have developed an ultra-thin optical phase modulator chip, nearly 100 times thinner than a human hair, which represents a significant advancement for quantum computing. Published in Nature Communications, this device precisely controls laser light, a critical requirement for operating quantum computers that may utilize thousands to millions of qubits. Unlike bulky laboratory equipment, the chip is manufactured using scalable methods similar to those for standard microchips, enabling mass production and reducing costs. Led by Jake Freedman and Matt Eichenfield, in collaboration with Sandia National Laboratories, the technology uses microwave-frequency vibrations to manipulate laser phases efficiently, generating stable new frequencies. This control is essential not only for quantum computing but also for quantum sensing and networking. The chip addresses key challenges in quantum systems, such as trapped ions or atoms that serve as qubits, by providing precise laser adjustments needed for calculations. It consumes about 80 times less microwave power than commercial modulators, reducing heat and allowing more optical channels to be integrated closely. This scalability and efficiency could transform quantum computing from experimental setups to practical, large-scale applications, making it a pivotal step toward future technological integration.",
