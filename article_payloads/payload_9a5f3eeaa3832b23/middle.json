  "title": "Cruz Beckham Embarks on Music Tour Amid Family Fame",
  "summary": "Cruz Beckham, the 21-year-old son of celebrities David and Victoria Beckham, is launching his music career as the frontman of a rock band. He recently started his first headline tour, with the opening show in Birmingham attracting hundreds of fans. Initially, Cruz performed under different names to avoid the intense scrutiny that comes with his famous family background, but he now embraces his identity. At concerts, he acknowledges his family connections, such as when a fan wore a Spice Girls shirt, but he focuses on his own music and refuses requests for family-related songs. The article highlights that Cruz is navigating the challenges of being a 'nepo baby'—someone who benefits from family connections—while trying to establish his own artistic credibility. Fans, including a 17-year-old who discovered him later on TikTok, praise his ebullient indie music as feel-good and career-worthy. Despite ongoing family drama involving his brother Brooklyn, Cruz maintains a strategy of keeping calm and carrying on, emphasizing fun and exuberance in his performances.",
