  "summary": "Casper Ruud, a Norwegian tennis player seeded 12th at the Australian Open, is facing a personal milestone as his wife Maria is heavily pregnant with their first child, a daughter. He has stated that if she goes into labor during the tournament in Melbourne, he will immediately depart to be with her, emphasizing that 'there's more to life than just tennis.' Ruud won his first-round match against Mattia Bellucci and expressed gratitude to Maria for allowing him to compete. He keeps his phone ringer on at all times except during matches to stay connected. Ruud, who travels with his family and is coached by his father Christian, a former player, views this as a new chapter where he plays not just for himself but for his growing family. He looks forward to bringing his wife and daughter to future tournaments, highlighting the balance between professional commitments and personal life.",
