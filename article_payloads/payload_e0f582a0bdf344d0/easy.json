  "title": "New Documents About a Bad Man and President Trump",
  "summary": "The Justice Department released many pages of documents about Jeffrey Epstein, a man who did bad things and went to jail. These papers talk about President Donald Trump too. People are upset because some parts of the documents are hidden or blacked out, and not all were released on time. A reporter named Liz Landers looked at the new papers. She found photos, videos, and letters from lawyers. Some pages are completely blacked out without saying why. There is also an email about 10 people who might have helped Epstein. This is important news that many are talking about.",
