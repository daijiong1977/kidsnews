  "title": "Lola Young's Comeback Show After Health Scare",
  "summary": "Lola Young is a famous singer who won a Grammy award. Last year, she collapsed on stage during a music festival, which worried her fans. She had to cancel her big tour to rest and get better. Now, she is feeling okay and has announced a special comeback show at the London Palladium on March 4th. This show is smaller and more intimate, so not all fans who had tickets before can come. She hopes to do bigger shows later. Tickets will go on sale soon, with a limit of two per person. Lola is excited to perform again and thank her fans for their support.",
