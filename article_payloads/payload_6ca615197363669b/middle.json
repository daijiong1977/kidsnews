  "title": "Lola Young's Return to Stage: A Story of Recovery and Resilience",
  "summary": "Lola Young, a 25-year-old Grammy-winning singer from south London, has announced her first headline live show since collapsing on stage at the All Things Go music festival in the US last September. The incident led her to cancel a worldwide tour, including dates in the UK, US, Mexico, and Canada, to focus on her health. In a statement, she assured fans she was 'doing ok' and would be 'going away for a while.' Since then, she has performed only twice: at a Spotify event in California and at the Grammy Awards, where she won Best Pop Performance for her song 'Messy.' Her upcoming show at the London Palladium on March 4th is billed as an intimate performance, with a capacity of 2,200, meaning some fans whose tickets were cancelled will miss out. Young expressed hope that fans will support her future larger shows. Tickets go on sale next Wednesday, limited to two per person, and are expected to be in high demand. This comeback highlights her resilience and the ongoing support from her fanbase amid health challenges.",
