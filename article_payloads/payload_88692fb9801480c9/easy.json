  "title": "Brain Supplement and Lifespan in Men",
  "summary": "Scientists studied two amino acids called phenylalanine and tyrosine, which are found in protein foods and brain supplements. They looked at data from over 270,000 people in the UK Biobank. The research found that men with higher levels of tyrosine in their blood might live about one year less on average. This link was not seen in women. Tyrosine helps make brain chemicals like dopamine, which affect mood and thinking. The study suggests that men might need to be careful with tyrosine levels for a longer life, but more research is needed. It did not test supplements directly, but raises questions about their long-term effects.",

    "Amino acids are small parts of proteins that our bodies need to work properly. They come from foods like meat, eggs, and beans. Some people take them as supplements to help with brain function or energy. Scientists study how these substances affect health over time, including how long people live. This article looks at two specific amino acids and their connection to lifespan, especially in men."
