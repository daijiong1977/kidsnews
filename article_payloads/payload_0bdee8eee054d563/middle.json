  "summary": "The Victoria & Albert Museum in London has launched an exhibit featuring a reconstruction of YouTube's original watchpage from December 2006, created in collaboration with YouTube using archived internet data. Additionally, the museum has acquired the first video ever uploaded to YouTube, Me at the Zoo, posted by co-founder Jawed Karim in April 2005. This video, with nearly 380 million views, symbolizes the rise of user-generated content and influenced digital design with features like rating buttons and sharing options. YouTube CEO Neal Mohan emphasized that the exhibit allows the public to experience the beginnings of a global cultural phenomenon. Senior curator Corinna Gardner noted it highlights internet history and digital design's impact on society. The V&A East Storehouse will also explore the reconstruction process, aligning with the museum's focus on preserving digital artifacts such as WeChat and Flappy Bird. This initiative aims to inspire future generations by showcasing how platforms like YouTube shaped media consumption and creation.",
