  "title": "Energy Bills and Network Upgrades",
  "summary": "Household energy bills in the UK will go up to pay for a big investment in the energy network. The regulator Ofgem has approved £28 billion to improve electricity and gas grids over five years. This will add about £108 to bills by 2031, but it will also save money by making energy cheaper and reducing reliance on imported gas. The net increase is around £30 per year. The investment aims to keep the energy supply safe and secure, helping protect people's bills in the future. Companies that manage the networks will use this money for maintenance and upgrades.",

    "Energy bills are payments for electricity and gas used at home. In the UK, a regulator called Ofgem oversees energy companies to ensure fair prices and safety. Networks include power lines and gas pipes that deliver energy. Investing in these networks means spending money to fix and improve them, which can lead to higher bills now but savings later by making energy cheaper and more secure."
