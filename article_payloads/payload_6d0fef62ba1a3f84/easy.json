  "summary": "Willie Colón was a famous musician who played the trombone and helped create salsa music. He was born in New York to parents from Puerto Rico and started his career when he was young. Willie made many popular songs like 'El Malo' and 'Oh, Qué Será' that people still love today. He used his music to tell stories about being Puerto Rican in America, mixing sounds from jazz and Caribbean music. Sadly, he passed away at age 75, surrounded by his family. His manager said Willie's music was not just for fun—it helped people feel proud of their culture and identity. He was called an architect of the New York sound because he brought salsa to big stages and made it important. Even today, stars like Bad Bunny mention him in songs to honor his legacy.",
