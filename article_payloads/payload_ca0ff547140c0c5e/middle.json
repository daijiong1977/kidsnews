  "title": "James Watson: DNA Pioneer and His Controversies",
  "summary": "James Watson, a key figure in the discovery of DNA's structure, passed away at the age of 97. Along with Francis Crick, he unveiled the double helix model of DNA in 1953, which revolutionized biology by explaining how genetic information is stored and passed on. This breakthrough earned them the Nobel Prize and cemented Watson's legacy as a scientific icon. However, his career was marred by controversial statements on race and intelligence, which sparked widespread outrage and led to his removal from various positions. The article from BBC Science highlights both his monumental contributions to science and the ethical dilemmas he posed, emphasizing the complexity of evaluating historical figures. It serves as a reminder that scientific progress must be balanced with social responsibility.",

  "background_read": [
    "James Watson was born in 1928 and became a prominent biologist. In the early 1950s, he and Francis Crick used X-ray data from Rosalind Franklin to propose the double helix model of DNA, which explained how genetic information is encoded. This discovery laid the foundation for modern genetics and biotechnology, leading to advances like gene therapy and DNA fingerprinting. Watson's career included leadership roles at Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, but he faced backlash for his views on race, which were deemed unscientific and harmful. The BBC article reflects on his dual legacy, encouraging readers to critically assess the ethics in science."
