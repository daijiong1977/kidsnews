  "summary": "James Watson was a famous scientist who helped discover DNA, which is like a tiny instruction book inside our bodies that tells us how to grow and live. He found this with another scientist, and it was a big deal because it helped us understand life better. Watson lived a long life and died when he was 97 years old. But he also said some mean things about people, which made others upset. This article talks about his important work and the problems he caused. It's good to learn about both the good and bad parts of famous people.",

    "James Watson was a scientist born in 1928. He worked with Francis Crick to figure out the structure of DNA in 1953, which was a huge discovery in science. DNA is found in all living things and helps pass traits from parents to children. Watson won a Nobel Prize for this, but later he made comments that were racist and hurtful, which caused many people to criticize him. This article from BBC Science shares his life story, including his achievements and the controversies."
