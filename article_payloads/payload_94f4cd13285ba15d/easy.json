  "title": "The Real Story of Thanksgiving",
  "summary": "Thanksgiving is a holiday where many Americans eat together, but its story is often told wrong. A historian explains that the Pilgrims and Native Americans did share a meal in 1621, but giving thanks feasts happened long before that. Native Americans, like the Wampanoag and people in Cahokia, had their own celebrations to thank for food and harvests. The Pilgrims were a group who left England to practice their religion freely. Over time, the Thanksgiving story focused only on the Pilgrims, leaving out Native Americans and others. This article helps us understand the full history so everyone is included.",

    "Thanksgiving is a holiday in the U.S. where families gather to eat turkey and other foods. Many people think it started with the Pilgrims and Native Americans in 1621, but Native American groups had similar celebrations for centuries before. The Pilgrims were English people who came to America to practice their religion without rules from the king. Over time, the story of Thanksgiving changed and left out Native Americans, making it seem like only the Pilgrims mattered. This article tells the true story to include everyone's history."
