  "title": "How Male Bonobos Find the Best Time to Have Babies",
  "summary": "Male bonobos are smart monkeys who live in the wild. They want to have babies, but female bonobos don't show a clear sign when they are ready. Females have a pink swelling that lasts a long time, but it doesn't always mean they can have babies right then. Scientists watched bonobos in a forest in Africa to see how males figure it out. They found that males look at the swelling and also check if a female has an older baby. This helps them guess the best time to try to have babies. Even though the signal is not perfect, males use it well to have more babies. This study shows how animals can be clever and use clues in nature.",

    "Bonobos are monkeys found in Africa, known for being peaceful and smart. They live in groups in forests. Scientists study them to understand how animals behave and have babies. In nature, animals often use signals, like sounds or colors, to communicate. This article talks about how male bonobos use a pink swelling on females as a clue, even though it's not always accurate, to help them have more babies. Learning about this helps us see how animals adapt and survive in the wild."
