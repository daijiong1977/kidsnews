  "title": "A Judge Takes Over Prison Health Care in Arizona",
  "summary": "A federal judge in Arizona has ordered someone else to take over health care in the state's prisons. This happened because for many years, prisoners did not get good medical and mental health care, which caused suffering and even deaths that could have been prevented. The judge said the state did not follow court rules to fix the problems, so now an independent person will be in charge to make sure prisoners get proper care. Lawyers for the prisoners say this change will save lives and stop the bad treatment. The state had promised to improve care in 2014 but did not keep its promises, leading to fines and this new order. The judge wants to protect prisoners from harm and make sure they are treated fairly under the law.",

    "In the United States, prisons are places where people who break laws are kept. Everyone, including prisoners, has rights to basic things like health care under the Constitution. Sometimes, if a state does not provide good care, a judge can step in to fix the problem. This article talks about Arizona, where prisoners have been suffering for years because they did not get proper medical help. A judge decided to have someone else take over to make sure prisoners are safe and healthy. This shows how the law can protect people when others do not do their job right."
