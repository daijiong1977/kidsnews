  "title": "Hidden Rocks Deep Inside Earth Shape Our Magnetic Field",
  "summary": "Scientists have found giant hot rocks deep inside Earth that help shape our magnetic field. These rocks are located about 2,900 kilometers below Africa and the Pacific Ocean. Earth's magnetic field is like a shield that protects us from harmful space rays, and it is made by the movement of liquid iron in the outer core. The new study shows that the hot rocks at the bottom of the mantle affect this liquid iron, making the magnetic field stronger in some areas. Researchers used old magnetic data and computer models to learn about these rocks over millions of years. This helps us understand how Earth has changed over time, including when continents like Pangaea formed and broke apart. The findings are important for studying ancient climates and life on Earth.",

    "Earth is made of layers like the crust, mantle, and core. The magnetic field is created by the movement of liquid iron in the outer core and protects us from solar radiation. Scientists study deep Earth using indirect methods like magnetism and computer simulations because we cannot dig that deep. This research helps explain how Earth's interior has evolved over millions of years."
