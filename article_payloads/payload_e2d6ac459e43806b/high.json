  "title": "Revealing Deep-Earth Thermal Heterogeneities and Their Role in Geomagnetic Evolution",
  "summary": "A groundbreaking study in Nature Geoscience, conducted by researchers from the University of Liverpool, unveils that colossal, thermally anomalous rock formations situated at the core-mantle boundary—approximately 2,900 kilometers beneath Africa and the Pacific Ocean—exert a profound influence on Earth's magnetic field. By integrating palaeomagnetic datasets with sophisticated numerical simulations of the geodynamo, the team reconstructed magnetic behavior over 265 million years, demonstrating that these structures induce sharp thermal contrasts at the interface between the mantle and outer core. Specifically, hot zones beneath the solid rock bodies cause stagnation in the liquid iron flow, whereas adjacent cooler regions facilitate vigorous convective motions, thereby modulating the magnetic field's stability and temporal variability. This research challenges the conventional paradigm of a dipolar magnetic field aligned with Earth's rotational axis, suggesting instead a more complex geomagnetic architecture shaped by deep-Earth heterogeneities. The implications extend to revising models of ancient continental configurations, such as Pangaea's formation and disintegration, and refining interpretations in palaeoclimatology, palaeobiology, and resource geology, which previously relied on simplified magnetic assumptions. The study underscores the critical role of interdisciplinary approaches in deciphering planetary interior dynamics over geological epochs.",
