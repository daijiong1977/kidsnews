  "title": "Deep-Earth Structures Influence Magnetic Field Over Millions of Years",
  "summary": "A study published in Nature Geoscience reveals that massive, intensely hot rock formations at the base of Earth's mantle, located about 2,900 kilometers below Africa and the Pacific Ocean, significantly influence the planet's magnetic field. Researchers from the University of Liverpool combined palaeomagnetic data with advanced computer simulations of the geodynamo—the process where liquid iron in the outer core generates the magnetic field—to analyze these structures over 265 million years. The findings show that these giant rock bodies create uneven heat at the core-mantle boundary, with hot zones beneath them causing the liquid iron to stagnate, while cooler regions experience vigorous flow. This affects the magnetic field's stability and variability over time. The research suggests that Earth's magnetic field does not behave as a perfect bar magnet aligned with the rotational axis, challenging previous assumptions. Implications include better understanding of ancient continental configurations like Pangaea, climate changes, and natural resource formation, as these areas relied on simplified magnetic models. The study highlights the importance of deep-Earth dynamics in shaping long-term planetary processes.",

    "Earth's interior consists of layers: crust, mantle, outer core, and inner core. The magnetic field is generated by the geodynamo in the liquid outer core, protecting the planet from solar wind. Studying deep Earth is challenging due to depth limitations; scientists use indirect methods like palaeomagnetism and computational models. This research builds on understanding planetary evolution, linking magnetic field behavior to tectonic and climatic history over geological timescales."
