  "title": "AI Helps Find Health Clues While You Sleep",
  "summary": "Scientists at Stanford Medicine made a smart computer program called SleepFM that can look at how your body works while you sleep. It uses sleep recordings from 65,000 people to learn patterns. The program checks things like brain activity and heart rhythms from a special sleep test done in a lab. It can guess if someone might get sick with over 100 different health problems later on. The AI learns like how we learn words, but it learns from body signals instead. This helps doctors find hidden health warnings early, so people can get help sooner. Sleep is important for health, and this new tool makes it easier to understand what our bodies tell us during sleep.",

    "Sleep is when our bodies rest and repair themselves. Scientists study sleep to understand health better. In labs, they use special tests called polysomnography to record brain waves, heartbeats, and breathing while people sleep. This helps find sleep problems like sleep apnea. Now, with AI like SleepFM, they can look at all this data to guess if someone might get sick in the future. This is important because catching health issues early can help people stay healthy. Sleep is a big part of our lives, and new tools make it easier to learn from it."
