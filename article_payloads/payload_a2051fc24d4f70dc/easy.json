  "title": "Nerve Injuries Change Our Body's Defenses",
  "summary": "Scientists at McGill University studied how nerve injuries affect our immune system, which is like our body's defense team. They found that when nerves get hurt, it can cause inflammation all over the body, not just where the injury happened. This might lead to long-term pain. The researchers used mice to see what happens. They discovered that male and female mice react differently to nerve injuries. In males, inflammation markers in the blood go up and stay high, but in females, they don't change much. However, blood from injured mice, whether male or female, can make healthy mice feel more pain. This shows that something in the blood spreads pain, but it works in different ways for males and females. Understanding these differences could help doctors create better treatments for chronic pain that work for everyone.",

    "Nerve injuries happen when nerves are damaged, often from accidents or pressure, and can lead to long-lasting pain. Our immune system helps heal injuries but can sometimes cause problems like inflammation. Scientists use mice in labs to learn about human health because they share similar body systems. This research helps us see how injuries affect the whole body and why men and women might need different care for pain."
