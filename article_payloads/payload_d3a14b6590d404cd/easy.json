  "title": "Jacob Elordi Learns a New Accent for a Movie",
  "summary": "Jacob Elordi is an actor from Australia who is starring in a new movie called Wuthering Heights. He plays a character named Heathcliffe, and the movie is set in Yorkshire, a place in England. To sound like he is from Yorkshire, Jacob practices a Northern accent in the bath. He says he likes words like 'mek' instead of 'make'. The movie is based on a classic book by Emily Brontë. At the premiere in London, many fans came to see Jacob and his co-star Margot Robbie. The event had decorations to look like Yorkshire, and singer Charli XCX also attended. She wrote music for the film and enjoyed working on it because it was different from her usual style. The film has caused some talk because of its casting and scenes.",
