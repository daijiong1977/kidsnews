  "title": "Tennis Player Gets Upset at Noisy Fans",
  "summary": "At a big tennis tournament called the Australian Open, a player named Alejandro Davidovich Fokina got very upset with some fans in the crowd. During his match against Reilly Opelka, he went to the front row and shouted at a group of people who were being loud and rude. He called them 'ignorant drunks' because they were not being respectful. The umpire, who is like a referee, had to step in and tell the player to calm down and talk to the fans. Davidovich Fokina won the match in five sets and celebrated by yelling and throwing his cap. Other players at the tournament, like Anastasia Potapova and Jaume Munar, also had problems with noisy fans. This shows that sometimes fans at tennis matches can be disruptive, and players want more respect from the crowd.",
