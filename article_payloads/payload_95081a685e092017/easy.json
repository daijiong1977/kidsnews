  "title": "New Plans to Stop Cages for Hens and Pigs",
  "summary": "The government in England wants to make new rules to help animals feel better. They plan to ban cages for hens and pigs. Hens are birds that lay eggs, and pigs are animals that have babies. The cages are used on farms to keep the animals safe, but some people think they are not nice for the animals. The government also wants to stop other things like puppy farms where dogs are bred in bad conditions. Farmers are worried because if other countries don't have the same rules, it might be hard for them to sell their food. Animal groups are happy about the plans and say it will make life better for farm animals. This is part of a big plan to improve animal welfare, which means taking care of animals properly.",

    "In England, the government makes rules to protect animals on farms. Animals like hens and pigs are often kept in cages to keep them safe, but some people think this is not good for their happiness. Animal welfare means making sure animals have what they need to be healthy. Farmers grow food and raise animals, and they want fair rules so they can compete with farmers in other countries. Puppy farms are places where dogs are bred too much and not taken care of well. The new plans aim to make life better for all these animals."
