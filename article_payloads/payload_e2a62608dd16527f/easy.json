  "summary": "Hannah Spencer is a plumber who just won a special election to become a new Member of Parliament for the Green Party. She is 34 years old and lives in Greater Manchester. Hannah worked as a plumber after leaving school at 16, but she also learned plastering by taking a course. She did not always want to be a politician, but she has been a local councilor for the Green Party. Now, she will go to the House of Commons in London to represent her area. Hannah says she will help people with jobs like plumbing and make sure their voices are heard. She is the fifth MP for the Green Party and won in a place called Gorton and Denton.

Hannah Spencer is a new MP who used to be a plumber, showing that people from different jobs can become politicians to help their communities."
