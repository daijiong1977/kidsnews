  "title": "Ghost Particles from the Sun Change Atoms Underground",
  "summary": "Scientists have discovered that ghost particles called neutrinos from the Sun can change atoms deep underground. Neutrinos are tiny particles that pass through everything, including people, without being noticed. In a special lab in Canada, researchers used a big detector to watch neutrinos hit carbon atoms and turn them into nitrogen atoms. They saw this happen a few times over many days. This helps us learn more about how the Sun works and how particles behave. The scientists are excited because this is a rare event that shows how neutrinos can cause hidden reactions in atoms.",

    "Neutrinos are very small particles that come from stars like the Sun. They are hard to study because they don't interact much with other things. Scientists build special labs deep underground to avoid other particles and watch neutrinos. In this experiment, they saw neutrinos change one type of atom into another, which is a rare event. This helps us understand how the Sun makes energy and how particles work in the universe."
