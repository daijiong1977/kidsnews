  "summary": "Roger Federer, a retired tennis legend, has publicly expressed his hope that Carlos Alcaraz can win the Australian Open and become the youngest man to complete the career Grand Slam. Alcaraz, aged 22 and currently world number one, aims to add the Melbourne title to his existing two Wimbledon, two French Open, and two US Open victories. Federer, who achieved his own career Grand Slam in 2009, acknowledged the difficulty of this feat, comparing it to golfer Rory McIlroy's pursuit of the Masters. Speaking at a news conference in Melbourne Park, Federer emphasized that completing the set at a young age would be 'crazy' and special for the sport. Alcaraz is engaged in a compelling rivalry with Jannik Sinner, with the pair splitting the last eight Grand Slam titles and contesting the past three finals. Federer praised their progression and ball-striking abilities, while also wishing them injury-free careers. Federer is in Melbourne for a ceremony honoring his legacy, marking his first visit since 2020.",
