    "Bridget Riley is a famous British artist known for her colorful and pattern-based paintings that often create optical illusions. She started her career in the 1960s and is still active today. Art exhibitions like this one help people learn about artists and their work by seeing it in person. Galleries are places where art is shared with the public, and curators help put together these shows to make them interesting and educational."
