    "Bridget Riley is a key figure in the Op Art movement, which emerged in the 1960s and focuses on optical illusions and perceptual effects in art. Her work often uses black and white or vibrant colors to create dynamic visual experiences. The Turner Contemporary is a well-known gallery in Margate, Kent, that hosts various art exhibitions and aims to make art accessible to the public. Curators like Melissa Blanchflower play a crucial role in bridging the gap between artists and audiences by selecting works that tell a story or highlight an artist's evolution. This exhibition not only celebrates Riley's long career but also encourages visitors to engage with art through hands-on activities like drawing classes."
