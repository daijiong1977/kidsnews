  "title": "EPA Stops Catching Polluters Under President Trump",
  "summary": "A new report shows that the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is not doing its job to stop polluters under President Donald Trump. The EPA is supposed to enforce laws that protect our air and water, but it filed only 16 lawsuits against polluters in Trump's first year back in office. That is much fewer than under past presidents. The report says this drop happened because the EPA is focusing on helping companies follow rules instead of punishing them when they break laws. Experts worry that without strong enforcement, more companies might pollute, harming people and the environment. The EPA leader, Lee Zeldin, has made changes to roll back pollution rules, and many staff who catch polluters have left their jobs.",

    "The EPA is a U.S. government agency created to protect human health and the environment by enforcing laws like the Clean Air Act. Under different presidents, its focus can change. President Trump has emphasized reducing regulations to help industries, which some argue leads to less enforcement against polluters. This report from a watchdog group shows how enforcement actions have dropped, raising concerns about pollution and public safety."
