  "title": "Trump's Plan to Fix Venezuela's Oil Faces Big Problems",
  "summary": "President Trump wants to take over Venezuela's oil industry and have American companies fix it up. Venezuela has a lot of oil, but its oil industry is broken because it hasn't been taken care of for years and there are international rules against it. Experts say it will take a long time and a lot of money to make it work again. American companies might help, but they want the country to be stable first. Right now, Venezuela's government is uncertain, with different leaders arguing. If the plan works, it could make oil prices lower in the future, but it won't change prices right away because there is already too much oil in the world. Companies like Chevron are already working in Venezuela, but others are waiting to see what happens.",

    "Venezuela is a country in South America known for having the largest oil reserves in the world, which means it has a lot of oil underground. Oil is used to make gasoline for cars and other fuels. In recent years, Venezuela has faced economic problems and political conflicts, making it hard to take care of its oil industry. The United States and other countries have put sanctions, or rules, that limit trade with Venezuela, hurting its oil production. President Trump has proposed a plan to help, but experts say it will be difficult because the country needs stability and big investments to fix its oil problems."
