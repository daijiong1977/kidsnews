  "title": "Challenges in Trump's Strategy to Revive Venezuela's Oil Sector",
  "summary": "President Donald Trump's proposal to seize control of Venezuela's oil industry and enlist American companies to revitalize it faces significant obstacles, according to experts. Venezuela possesses the world's largest proven crude oil reserves, approximately 303 billion barrels, but its oil infrastructure has deteriorated due to years of neglect and international sanctions. This decay means that rebuilding production to historic levels—potentially doubling or tripling from the current 1.1 million barrels per day—will require substantial time and investment. American oil companies, such as Chevron which already operates in Venezuela, are hesitant to commit major resources without political stability, as the country's leadership remains contested with ongoing disputes between U.S. and Venezuelan officials. Analysts like Patrick De Haan and Phil Flynn note that while a successful U.S. intervention could lead to optimism and lower oil prices in the long term by increasing global supply, immediate price impacts are unlikely due to existing market surpluses and Venezuela's OPEC membership. The article highlights that the plan's feasibility depends on resolving political uncertainties and securing corporate interest, with companies like ConocoPhillips monitoring developments cautiously.",

    "Venezuela, located in South America, holds the world's largest proven crude oil reserves, estimated at 303 billion barrels, accounting for about 17% of global reserves. Historically, its oil industry was a major economic driver, but in recent decades, it has suffered from mismanagement, corruption, and declining investment. International sanctions, particularly from the United States, have further crippled production by restricting trade and access to technology. The country is a member of OPEC, which coordinates oil production among member nations to influence prices. Political turmoil, including the contested presidency between Nicolás Maduro and U.S.-backed interim leaders, has created instability, deterring foreign investment. American oil companies have shown interest due to the vast reserves but are wary of risks. Understanding these factors is key to analyzing Trump's plan, which aims to leverage U.S. influence to rebuild the industry, though experts highlight challenges like infrastructure decay and the need for stability."
