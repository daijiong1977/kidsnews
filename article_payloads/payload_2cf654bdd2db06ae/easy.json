  "title": "AI Brings Back Ancient Babylonian Song",
  "summary": "Scientists used smart computer programs called artificial intelligence to find and put together pieces of an old song from Babylon, a city from 3,000 years ago. This song talks about how beautiful and rich Babylon was, and it even says that women could be priests, which was unusual back then. People used to learn this song in school long ago, and now it helps us understand what life was like in ancient times. It's exciting because it shows how technology can help us learn about history.",

    "Babylon was an ancient city in Mesopotamia, now part of Iraq, known for its advanced culture and the Hanging Gardens. It existed around 2000 BCE to 500 BCE and was a powerful empire. Hymns were songs sung in religious events to praise gods or describe important ideas. Artificial intelligence is a modern technology that uses computers to solve problems, like putting together old texts from broken pieces."
