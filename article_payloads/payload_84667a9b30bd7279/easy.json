  "title": "A Blood Test for Crohn's Disease Before You Feel Sick",
  "summary": "Scientists have found a new blood test that can tell if someone might get Crohn's disease years before they start feeling sick. Crohn's disease is a sickness in the stomach and intestines that causes pain and tiredness. The test looks at how the body's immune system reacts to a protein called flagellin, which is found on some bacteria in the gut. People who later get Crohn's often have a stronger reaction to this protein early on. This discovery could help doctors find the disease sooner and maybe stop it from happening. The research was done by doctors at Sinai Health as part of a big project called GEM, which studies healthy family members of people with Crohn's to learn how the disease starts. This is important because more kids are getting Crohn's disease now than before.",

    "Crohn's disease is a chronic condition that affects the digestive system, causing inflammation, pain, and fatigue. It can make daily life hard for people who have it. In recent years, more children have been diagnosed with Crohn's, and the number of cases is growing. Scientists are working to understand why this happens and how to detect it early. The immune system normally protects the body, but in Crohn's, it may attack helpful gut bacteria by mistake. This new blood test focuses on a protein from these bacteria, offering hope for early detection and prevention."
