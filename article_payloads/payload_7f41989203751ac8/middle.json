  "summary": "Vince Zampella, the co-creator of the influential video game series Call of Duty, died at age 55 in a car crash in Los Angeles, California. The incident occurred on a highway when his Ferrari veered off the road, struck a concrete barrier, and caught fire, resulting in the deaths of both occupants. Zampella was a key figure in the gaming industry, having co-founded Respawn Entertainment and contributed to major titles like Medal of Honor, Titanfall, and Apex Legends. His work on Call of Duty, which debuted in 2003 and has sold over 500 million copies, helped shape modern gaming. Colleagues and journalists, such as Geoff Keighley and Keza MacDonald, praised him as a visionary who prioritized player experience and transparency. Despite past conflicts, including a legal dispute with Activision in 2010, Zampella remained respected for his creative impact. The crash is under investigation by the California Highway Patrol, with details about the driver and passenger still unclear.",
