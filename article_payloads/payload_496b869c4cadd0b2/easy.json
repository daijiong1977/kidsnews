    "Greenland is a cold, icy island that is part of Denmark but has its own government. Countries like the United States, Russia, and China are interested in Greenland because it has resources and is in a strategic location near the Arctic. Leaders often talk about land and safety to protect their countries. This story helps us learn how presidents make decisions and work with other countries."
