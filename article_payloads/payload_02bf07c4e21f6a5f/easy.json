  "title": "Men Secretly Filming Women for Money",
  "summary": "A BBC investigation found that men are secretly filming women on nights out and making money by posting the videos online. These videos are called 'walking tours' or 'nightlife content' and are shared on websites like YouTube, TikTok, Facebook, and Instagram. They often show women from behind or low angles, sometimes revealing private parts of their bodies. Many women did not know they were filmed and felt scared and embarrassed when they found out. For example, one woman saw a video of herself that was watched by millions of people and now feels nervous when she goes outside. The BBC found over 65 channels with these videos, which have been viewed billions of times in cities like London, Manchester, and Bangkok. The BBC team went undercover to film the men doing this and identified some of them. While filming in public is not always illegal, a lawyer says it might break harassment laws. Some videos were removed after the BBC reported them, but others are still online.",

    "This article talks about a serious problem where men secretly film women in public places, like on nights out, and post the videos online to make money. Many women do not know they are being filmed and feel upset when they find out. The BBC did an investigation to find these men and show what is happening. It is important to understand that filming without permission can hurt people, even if it is in a public space. Laws about this are tricky, but it might be against harassment rules. This helps us learn about privacy and respect for others."
