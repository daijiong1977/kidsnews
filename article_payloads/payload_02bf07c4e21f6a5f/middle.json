  "title": "Covert Filming of Women for Profit: A BBC Investigation",
  "summary": "A BBC investigation has revealed that men are covertly filming women during nights out and profiting by uploading the footage to online platforms such as YouTube, TikTok, Facebook, and Instagram. These videos, often labeled as 'walking tours' or 'nightlife content,' predominantly focus on women wearing dresses or skirts, captured from behind or at low angles, sometimes exposing intimate body parts without consent. The investigation identified over 65 channels featuring this content, which has amassed more than three billion views over three years across global cities including London, Oslo, Miami, Bangkok, and notably Manchester. Nearly 50 women were tracked down, many unaware of being filmed, and they reported feelings of fear and humiliation; for instance, one 21-year-old woman became paranoid after discovering a video of herself viewed millions of times. The BBC team conducted undercover operations in Manchester, exposing prolific operators linked to 12 accounts, including a local taxi driver and men from Sweden. While filming in public is not inherently illegal, a specialist lawyer noted it occupies a legal 'grey area' and may violate harassment or voyeurism laws. Platforms like YouTube and TikTok removed some accounts after the BBC's findings, but many videos remain active, highlighting ongoing challenges in addressing non-consensual image-based abuse.",
