  "title": "A Leader Asked a Helper to Watch a Search",
  "summary": "This article talks about something that happened in Georgia. The FBI, which is a group of police officers for the whole country, went to an elections office to look for things. Tulsi Gabbard, who is a leader in the government, said that President Trump asked her to be there while the FBI searched. This made people worried about how elections are kept safe and who has the power to do things like searches. The article says this is unusual because leaders don't usually watch police searches. People in Congress, especially Democrats, wanted to know why she was there, so she wrote a letter to explain. She also helped President Trump talk to the FBI agents on the phone. This story is important because it shows how leaders might get involved in police work, which can be a problem for fairness.",

    "This article is about a recent event where the FBI searched an elections office in Fulton County, Georgia. Elections offices help make sure voting is fair and safe. The FBI is a federal police agency that investigates crimes across the country. Tulsi Gabbard is the Director of National Intelligence, a job that involves overseeing intelligence agencies. President Trump was the president at the time. When police do a search, they usually need a search warrant from a judge. It's unusual for government leaders to be involved in police searches because it might not be fair. This story shows how leaders' actions can affect how people trust elections and police work."
