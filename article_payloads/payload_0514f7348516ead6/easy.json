  "title": "NASA's Perseverance Rover Keeps Going on Mars",
  "summary": "NASA's Perseverance rover has been exploring Mars for almost five years and is still working very well. It landed in a big crater called Jezero and has driven 40 kilometers, which is twice as far as expected. The rover is healthy and can keep going for many more years because it uses a special power source that won't run out. Engineers are testing it to drive up to 100 kilometers to explore more of Mars and maybe meet a future mission to pick up rock samples. Perseverance has collected 33 rock samples in tubes, some left on Mars and some kept on the rover. NASA is planning how to bring these samples back to Earth, but it might take until the 2030s. The rover's wheels and arm are important for its long life.",

    "Mars is the fourth planet from the Sun and is often called the red planet because of its color. NASA sends rovers like Perseverance to explore Mars and learn about its rocks, soil, and past. Rovers are robots that drive around, take pictures, and collect samples. Perseverance landed in Jezero Crater, which scientists think was once a lake, to look for signs of ancient life. The rover uses a radioactive power source called plutonium to keep working for many years without needing sunlight. NASA hopes to bring Mars samples back to Earth someday to study them in labs, but it's a big and expensive project that might take a long time."
