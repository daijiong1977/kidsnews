  "title": "A Mysterious Metal Discovery in Sweden",
  "summary": "In Sweden, archaeologists found a special metal object called a plano-convex ingot. At first, they thought it was from the Bronze Age, but tests showed it was made of a copper-zinc-tin-lead alloy from the Iron Age. This ingot is shaped like a rounded lump and was used to carry metal long ago. Scientists from the University of Gothenburg worked with experts from Poland to study it. They used science to learn about its makeup and history. This discovery helps us understand how people in the past traded and connected with each other. It shows that teamwork and careful study can reveal secrets from history, even from a single object.",

    "The Iron Age was a period in history when people started using iron for tools and weapons, after the Bronze Age. Archaeologists dig up old objects to learn how people lived long ago. Metals like copper and bronze were important for making things. When scientists find artifacts, they use tests to figure out what they are made of and when they were used. This helps us understand ancient trade and how different groups communicated."
