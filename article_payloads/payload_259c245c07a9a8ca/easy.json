  "title": "A Big Problem in a Hospital Changing Room",
  "summary": "In a hospital in Darlington, some nurses felt upset when a trans woman used the female changing room. They said it made them uncomfortable and reminded one nurse of bad memories. The nurses complained to their bosses, but nothing changed at first. Later, a court said the hospital bosses did something wrong by letting the trans woman use that room without thinking about the nurses' feelings. The court said the bosses should have found a better solution. This story shows how workplaces, like hospitals, can have big arguments about fairness and respect for everyone. It teaches us that it's important to listen to all people and find ways to make everyone feel safe and happy at work.",

    "This story is about a real event in a UK hospital where nurses and a trans woman had a disagreement over using a changing room. It shows how workplaces, especially big ones like the NHS (the UK's health service), can face challenges when people have different needs and feelings. Understanding this helps us learn about respect, fairness, and how to solve problems together in places where we work or go to school."
