  "title": "New Rules for College Teachers in Texas",
  "summary": "At Texas A&M University, a big school in Texas, there is a new rule for teachers. They must ask the school president for permission before talking about certain topics like race and gender in their classes. This happened after a video of a student arguing with a teacher became very popular online. The rule is meant to make sure discussions are fair and do not cause problems. Some people think this is a good idea to keep things calm, while others worry it might stop important conversations. It's all about how schools handle tricky subjects.",

Sometimes, discussions on these topics can be sensitive, and schools make rules to handle them carefully. This new policy means teachers need permission to talk about these issues to avoid conflicts."
