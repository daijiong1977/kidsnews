  "title": "Texas A&M Implements Approval Policy for Sensitive Topics",
  "summary": "The Texas A&M University System has introduced a new policy that requires professors to obtain approval from the university president before discussing certain race and gender topics in their classes. This decision was made by the board of regents in response to a viral video where a student confronted an instructor over lessons on these subjects, leading to significant campus unrest. The policy aims to regulate how sensitive issues are taught to prevent conflicts and ensure appropriateness. Supporters argue it maintains order and respects diverse viewpoints, while opponents fear it could suppress academic freedom and hinder open dialogue. This move reflects broader debates in education about balancing free speech with institutional control.",
