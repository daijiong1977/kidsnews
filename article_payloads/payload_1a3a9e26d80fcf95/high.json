  "summary": "Manon Bannerman, a 23-year-old member of the multinational girl group Katseye, has announced a temporary hiatus to concentrate on her health and wellbeing, following collaborative discussions within the group. Formed in 2023 via The Debut: Dream Academy, Katseye comprises six members and has achieved rapid global recognition, including Grammy nominations. The group will maintain their performance schedule during her absence, though no return date is specified. This development occurs amidst broader challenges faced by the group, such as extensive online scrutiny and thousands of death threats, which members have characterized as psychologically terrorizing. The announcement, disseminated through WeVerse and supported by labels HYBE and Geffen Records, underscores the intersection of mental health, fame, and the pressures inherent in the contemporary music industry. It reflects a growing awareness of artist wellbeing in response to the demanding nature of global stardom and public exposure.",
