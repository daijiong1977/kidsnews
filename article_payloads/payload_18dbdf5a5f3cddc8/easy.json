  "summary": "Prime Minister Keir Starmer has chosen Dame Antonia Romeo to be the new cabinet secretary, which is the top job in the UK civil service. This is a big deal because she is the first woman to have this role in over 100 years. The civil service helps the government make and carry out plans for the country. Dame Antonia has worked in many important government departments for 25 years, like the Home Office and Ministry of Justice. She says she loves the civil service and wants it to be known for getting things done efficiently and innovatively. She replaces Sir Chris Wormald, who left after a short time. The prime minister picked her because he thinks she is a great public servant who can deliver results for the people.",
