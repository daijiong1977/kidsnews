  "title": "Titanic Artifact Auction Sets Record with Straus Pocket Watch",
  "summary": "A gold pocket watch recovered from Isidor Straus, one of the wealthiest passengers on the Titanic, sold for a record-breaking £1.78 million at an auction in Devizes, Wiltshire. The watch, made by Jules Jurgensen, was found on Straus's body after the Titanic sank on April 14, 1912, due to an iceberg collision, resulting in over 1,500 deaths. Straus was a German-born American businessman and co-owner of Macy's department store. His wife, Ida, famously refused to leave him and perished with him; her body was never found. The watch had stopped at 02:20, marking the time the ship disappeared, and was originally a 43rd birthday gift from Ida in 1888. Other items auctioned included a letter written by Ida on Titanic stationery, which sold for £100,000, a passenger list for £104,000, and a gold medal for the Carpathia crew for £86,000, totaling £3 million. Auctioneer Andrew Aldridge highlighted the enduring public fascination with Titanic stories, as these artifacts preserve personal histories from over a century ago.",

    "The Titanic was a luxurious ocean liner that embarked on its maiden voyage from Southampton to New York in 1912. Considered unsinkable, it struck an iceberg and sank, leading to significant loss of life and prompting changes in maritime safety laws. Isidor Straus and his wife Ida were prominent figures; he was a successful businessman and former congressman. Their tragic story of loyalty has become emblematic of the disaster. Auctions of Titanic artifacts often attract high bids due to the historical and emotional weight, reflecting how material objects can preserve memories and educate future generations about past events."
