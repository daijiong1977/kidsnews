  "title": "A Special Watch from the Titanic Sells for a Lot of Money",
  "summary": "A gold pocket watch that belonged to a rich passenger on the Titanic was sold for £1.78 million at an auction. The watch was found on Isidor Straus, who died when the Titanic sank in 1912 after hitting an iceberg. He was a businessman who owned Macy's store. His wife Ida also died because she did not want to leave him. The watch stopped at 2:20 AM, the time the ship sank. It was a birthday gift from Ida. Other items from the Titanic were sold too, like a letter and a passenger list. The auction made £3 million in total. People are still very interested in the Titanic story after 113 years.",
