  "title": "How Scientists Measure Super-Fast Quantum Time",
  "summary": "Scientists have found a new way to measure how fast things happen in the tiny world of quantum physics. In quantum physics, events like electrons moving after absorbing light happen incredibly fast—in just a few attoseconds, which is way shorter than a blink of an eye. It's hard to measure this because using clocks can mess up the process. Professor Hugo Dil and his team at EPFL used a clever method without clocks. They looked at how electrons spin when they absorb light and escape from materials. By studying this spin, they could tell how long the quantum transition takes. They tested different materials like copper and titanium diselenide and found that simpler atomic structures make the process slower. For example, in copper, it takes about 26 attoseconds, but in chain-like materials, it can be over 200 attoseconds. This helps us understand how the shape of materials affects quantum time.",
