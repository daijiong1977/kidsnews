  "title": "President Trump's Plan to Help End the War in Ukraine",
  "summary": "President Trump says the United States is making progress in trying to stop the war in Ukraine. He has sent two special helpers, or envoys, to talk with leaders from Russia and Ukraine. One envoy will meet with Russia's leader, Vladimir Putin, in Moscow, and another will talk with Ukrainian officials after meeting Russians in Abu Dhabi. Ukraine's president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, is happy about the progress and hopes to work closely with America. He believes that America's strength is important because Russia listens to them. The main issues still being discussed include whether Ukraine might have to give up some land to Russia to end the fighting. This news wrap also mentions other events, like Israel getting human remains from Gaza and the FBI wanting to interview some lawmakers.",

    "The war in Ukraine started when Russia invaded Ukraine in 2022. Many countries, including the United States, are trying to help stop the fighting and find a peaceful solution. Envoys are special representatives who travel to discuss important matters. President Trump is the leader of the United States, and he is working with other leaders to resolve conflicts. Understanding this helps us see why peace talks are important for safety and cooperation in the world."
