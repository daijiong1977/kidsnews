  "title": "How Hair Shows Lead Pollution Dropped Over 100 Years",
  "summary": "Long ago, lead was a common pollutant in the United States from things like factories, paint, and car exhaust. Lead is a harmful metal that can cause health problems, especially for kids. In 1970, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) was created to make rules to reduce lead pollution. Scientists at the University of Utah studied hair samples from people over 100 years to see how lead levels changed. They found that before the EPA rules, lead levels in hair were about 100 times higher than after the rules. This shows that environmental regulations helped make people healthier by lowering lead exposure. The study reminds us that rules are important to protect our health, even if they might seem tough for businesses. Hair samples from family scrapbooks helped scientists learn about the past.",

    "Lead is a heavy metal that was used in many products like paint and gasoline because it worked well, but it is poisonous and can hurt people, especially children, by causing learning problems. Before 1970, there were few rules to control lead pollution in the U.S., so it was everywhere. The EPA started making rules to remove lead from things we use every day. Scientists use hair to check for chemicals because hair grows slowly and keeps a record of what's in our bodies over time. This study shows how rules helped reduce lead and keep people healthier."
