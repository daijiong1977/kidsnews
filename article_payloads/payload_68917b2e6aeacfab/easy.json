  "title": "Tennis Players Want More Prize Money at Australian Open",
  "summary": "The Australian Open is a big tennis tournament that starts in January. This year, it is giving out a record amount of prize money, which is the money players win. The total prize money is $111.5 million, which is 16% more than last year. The winners of the singles events will get $4.15 million each. All players, including those in singles and doubles, will get at least 10% more money than before. The tournament's boss, Craig Tiley, says this shows they want to help tennis players at all levels. But some top players are unhappy because they think the prize money should be a bigger part of the tournament's total earnings. They also want better support for things like health care and pensions. Last year, other big tournaments like the US Open and Wimbledon gave similar or lower shares of their money to players.",

    "The Australian Open is one of the four biggest tennis tournaments in the world, called Grand Slams. It happens every year in Melbourne, Australia, and many top players compete to win trophies and money. Prize money is important because it helps players pay for their training, travel, and living costs. Sometimes, players ask for more money to make sure they are treated fairly, especially compared to how much money the tournaments make from tickets and TV deals. This article talks about how the Australian Open is giving more money this year, but some players still think it's not enough."
