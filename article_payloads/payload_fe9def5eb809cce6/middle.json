  "title": "Netflix Leads Bid for Warner Bros Amid Corporate Battle",
  "summary": "Netflix is close to acquiring Warner Bros Discovery's film and streaming divisions, outbidding rivals like Comcast and Paramount Skydance with an offer of $28 per share. Paramount had previously bid $24 per share for the entire company, including cable networks like CNN, but was rejected, leading Warner Bros to put itself up for sale. Paramount has since raised its bid to around $27 per share and criticized the sale process as unfair, alleging favoritism toward Netflix. Warner Bros owns major franchises such as Harry Potter and Game of Thrones, along with HBO Max. An investment strategist notes that Netflix's bid targets only profitable segments, while Paramount's includes less profitable parts, sparking a public dispute. The potential deal could create a dominant global entertainment entity, likely attracting scrutiny from US competition regulators to ensure market fairness.",
