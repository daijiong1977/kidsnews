  "title": "EPA Stops Counting Health Benefits in Air Pollution Rules",
  "summary": "The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is changing how it makes rules about air pollution. For many years, when the EPA wanted to limit pollution, it would look at two things: the cost of the rules, like money for new equipment, and the benefits, like how much healthier people would be. Now, the EPA is deciding to only count the costs and not put a dollar value on the health benefits. This change affects tiny particles called PM2.5 and a gas called ozone, which can make people sick. The EPA says it's doing this because the benefits are hard to measure exactly, but critics worry this will make it easier to allow more pollution. The article explains that this is a big shift in how the government protects our air.",

    "Air pollution is a big problem that can make people sick, especially kids and older adults. The EPA is a government group that tries to keep our air clean by making rules for factories and cars. Sometimes, these rules cost money, but they also help people stay healthy. This article talks about how the EPA is changing its way of thinking by focusing more on costs and less on health benefits, which could affect how clean our air is in the future."
