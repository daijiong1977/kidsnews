  "title": "President Trump Stops Using a Company's AI Tools",
  "summary": "President Donald Trump has told all government agencies to stop using technology from a company called Anthropic. Anthropic makes AI tools, but it refused to let the military use them without limits. The government says this is a risk and will not work with Anthropic anymore. Anthropic says this is unfair and will fight it in court. They are worried the government might use their AI for spying on people or making weapons that work alone. Trump says Anthropic's tools will be removed from government work over six months. This affects companies that work with the military too. Anthropic wants to help switch to other tools if needed.",

    "This article is about a disagreement between the U.S. government and a technology company. President Trump is the leader who made a big decision. Anthropic is a company that creates artificial intelligence, or AI, which are computer programs that can think and learn. The military is part of the government that keeps the country safe. Sometimes, companies and governments argue about how technology should be used, especially if it involves privacy or safety. This story shows how rules and fairness are important in business and government."
