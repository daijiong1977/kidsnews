  "title": "Reform Party Wants to Change Pensions for New Government Workers",
  "summary": "The Reform party in the UK has a plan to change how pensions work for new local government workers. Right now, many government workers have pensions that promise a certain amount of money when they retire, called defined benefit schemes. Reform wants to stop new workers from joining these schemes. Instead, new hires would get defined contribution pensions, where the money they get depends on how much is saved and how investments do, which can go up or down. Reform also wants to combine nearly 100 different pension schemes into one big fund worth £500 billion. This fund would invest more money in UK companies, houses, and roads to help the economy grow. Some people, like unions, are against this plan because they think it will make retired workers poorer and cause problems in hiring workers for government jobs.",

    "Pensions are money that people receive after they stop working, usually when they are older. In the UK, some workers, like those in local government, have pensions that promise a specific amount based on their salary. Other pensions depend on how much money is saved and invested over time. The Reform party is proposing changes to these systems for new workers, which has caused debate among unions and others who worry about workers' futures."
