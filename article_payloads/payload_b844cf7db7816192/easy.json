  "title": "Tiny Magnets Fight Bone Cancer and Help Bones Heal",
  "summary": "Scientists from Brazil and Portugal have made a new tiny material that can fight bone cancer and help bones heal. It is made of iron oxide nanoparticles, which are like small magnets, covered with a special glass. When a magnetic field is applied, the material gets hot and can kill cancer cells. At the same time, the glass coating helps new bone grow. This is important because it does two jobs at once: attacking the tumor and repairing the bone. The researchers tested it in a liquid that mimics the body and found it works well, especially when it has more calcium. This could lead to better treatments for people with bone cancer, making healing faster and safer.",

    "Bone cancer is a disease where bad cells grow in bones, making them weak and painful. Doctors often use surgery or medicine to treat it, but these can damage healthy bone. Scientists are looking for new ways to fight cancer while helping bones repair themselves. This article talks about a new material that uses tiny magnets to heat and kill cancer cells, and a special coating to encourage new bone growth. It could make treatments safer and more effective for patients."
