  "summary": "BTS, the renowned K-pop group, has announced a massive 79-date world tour, marking their return to live performances after a four-year hiatus. The tour will commence in April 2026 in Goyang Stadium, South Korea, and span across Asia, Europe, and America, including major cities like London, Tokyo, Munich, Sydney, and Los Angeles. Featuring a 360-degree in-the-round stage design to maximize seating capacity, the tour is poised to be one of the year's largest events. Tickets will be available from January 2026, with expectations of high demand similar to recent major tours. According to Billboard, BTS and their label Hybe could generate over $1 billion from this reunion, encompassing concert revenue, merchandise, licensing, album sales, and streaming. This comeback follows the completion of mandatory military service by all members, including Suga who finished last June, and comes after Hybe reported a 37.5% drop in operating profit during the band's break. BTS, formed in the early 2010s, played a key role in popularizing K-pop globally with their blend of pop and hip-hop, and their previous tour earned $246 million, setting records. The announcement livestream attracted over seven million viewers, indicating immense fan anticipation.",

K-pop, or Korean pop, combines music, dance, and visual elements, with BTS gaining fame for their introspective lyrics and social messages.
