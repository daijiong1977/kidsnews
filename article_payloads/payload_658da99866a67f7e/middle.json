  "title": "The Hidden Burden of Menopause Masking in Society",
  "summary": "This article explores the phenomenon of 'menopause masking,' where women conceal symptoms like brain fog, vaginal dryness, and bladder weakness due to societal stigma and embarrassment. The author, a journalist, sparked a national conversation by sharing her experience with perimenopause brain fog on LinkedIn, receiving hundreds of supportive responses that revealed widespread shame around menopause. Despite public figures like Oprah Winfrey advocating for openness, a survey indicates over 75% of women feel inadequately informed about menopause. The article details consequences such as increased fatigue and burnout risk, as explained by a GP specialist, and highlights policy changes like NHS health checks and employer action plans in the UK. However, many women still struggle to discuss menopause openly, impacting their well-being and professional lives. The piece argues for normalizing conversations to reduce stigma and improve support for the half of the population affected by menopause.",

    "Menopause is a biological process marking the end of a woman's reproductive years, typically occurring between ages 45-55, with perimenopause as a preceding phase. It involves hormonal changes leading to symptoms such as hot flashes, mood changes, and cognitive issues like brain fog. Societal attitudes often stigmatize menopause, viewing it as a taboo or sign of aging, which can discourage open discussion. In recent years, advocacy by celebrities and policy initiatives, like those in the UK, aim to increase awareness and support. Understanding menopause is crucial for promoting women's health and workplace inclusivity, as it affects a significant portion of the population."
