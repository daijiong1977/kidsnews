  "title": "Women Hiding Menopause Symptoms and Why It's Hard",
  "summary": "This article talks about how many women feel they need to hide their menopause symptoms, like brain fog or pain, because they are embarrassed or think others will judge them. The author shared her own story about having trouble remembering things on TV due to perimenopause, and many people thanked her for talking about it. Famous people like Oprah Winfrey have also spoken out to make menopause less secret. Hiding symptoms can make women very tired and stressed, and it might lead to burnout. The article says that menopause affects half the population, so it's important to talk about it openly. Some changes are happening, like new health checks and workplace plans, but many women still don't know enough about menopause and feel they can't discuss it.",
