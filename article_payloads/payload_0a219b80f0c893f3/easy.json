  "title": "Long Lines at Airports in Europe",
  "summary": "People traveling to Europe might face very long waits at airport passport control because of a new system called EES. This system uses fingerprints and photos to check who is entering, and it is causing delays, especially during busy times like holidays or ski season. Airports in places like Geneva and Tenerife have reported waits of up to several hours. The European Commission says they can pause the system at peak times until September to help. The goal is to make border checks more digital and secure, but it is creating problems for travelers right now.",

    "Airports in Europe are introducing a new digital system called the Entry-Exit System (EES) to make border checks more secure. Instead of stamping passports with ink, it uses fingerprints and photos for non-EU travelers. This is part of the Schengen zone, where people can move freely between many European countries. However, the system is causing long lines at passport control, especially during busy times like holidays, because it takes longer to process people. Airports are trying to add more staff to help, but travelers might face delays until things improve."
