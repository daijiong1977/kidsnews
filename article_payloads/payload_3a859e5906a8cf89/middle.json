  "title": "Sabalenka Overcomes Pressure in Australian Open Opener",
  "summary": "World number one Aryna Sabalenka started her Australian Open campaign with a victory over French wildcard Tiantsoa Rakotomanga Rajaonah, winning 6-4 6-1 on Rod Laver Arena. The match was notable because tennis legends Roger Federer and Rod Laver watched from the front row, adding pressure that Sabalenka acknowledged by saying she tried not to look at them. Despite an error-prone first set where she was broken early, Sabalenka recovered, saving a break point and winning five consecutive games to secure the match. Afterward, she took a selfie with Federer and Laver, expressing hope they enjoyed her performance. Sabalenka has a strong record in Australia, having won the Australian Open in 2023 and 2024, and only losing one of her past 22 matches at the tournament. Her recent form includes a title at the Brisbane International, highlighting her preparation for this major event. This article explores how top athletes manage external pressures while maintaining focus on their goals.",
