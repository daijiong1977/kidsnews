  "title": "Managing Post-Holiday Work Anxiety: Strategies for a Smoother Return",
  "summary": "Returning to work after the Christmas break often brings feelings of reluctance, anxiety, and low energy, even for those who enjoy their jobs. Psychologists and workplace experts explain that this common experience is less about motivation and more about adjusting one's mindset. A key focus is on Sunday, when \"Sunday blues\" arise from anticipatory stress as the brain predicts Monday's demands. To ease this transition, experts recommend creating a gentle bridge between weekend and work mode. Strategies include being intentional with Sunday activities, such as engaging in absorbing tasks like exercise or socializing, and establishing small rituals like walks or preparing work clothes. For persistent worries, a \"thought download\"—writing down tasks and anxieties—can externalize mental clutter, reduce rehearsal in the brain, and improve sleep. If anxiety extends beyond Monday, it may stem from overload rather than lack of motivation. Overall, these approaches help reframe the return to work, making it less abrupt and more manageable.",
