  "title": "Collagen Supplements: Not a Magic Fix for Skin",
  "summary": "Collagen is a protein in our skin that helps keep it smooth and firm. As we get older, our bodies make less collagen, which can cause wrinkles. Many people take collagen supplements, like pills or powders, hoping to make their skin look younger. But dermatologists, who are skin doctors, say these supplements might not work well. Research shows mixed results, with some studies finding benefits and others not. Also, supplements can have safety issues, like contamination from seafood, and they are not checked by the government like medicines. Instead, experts suggest better ways to help your skin, like eating healthy foods with protein and vitamin C, using sunscreen, and avoiding smoking. These habits support your body's own collagen production naturally.",

    "Collagen is a natural protein found in our bodies that helps keep skin, bones, and joints healthy. As people age, their bodies produce less collagen, leading to signs like wrinkles and sagging skin. Many companies sell collagen supplements claiming they can reverse aging, but skin doctors warn that these products are not proven to work and may have risks. Learning about healthy habits, such as eating fruits and vegetables and protecting skin from the sun, can be more effective for maintaining skin health."
