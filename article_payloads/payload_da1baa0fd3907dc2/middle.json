  "title": "Israel's Conscription Crisis: Religion vs. National Service",
  "summary": "Israel is facing a severe political crisis over the conscription of ultra-Orthodox Jewish men into the military, threatening to destabilize Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's government. Historically, ultra-Orthodox men enrolled in full-time religious study have been exempt from military service since Israel's founding in 1948, but this exemption was ruled illegal by the High Court of Justice nearly two decades ago. Temporary measures ended last year, prompting the government to issue draft notices to 24,000 ultra-Orthodox men, yet only about 1,200 reported for duty. This has led to widespread protests, including a massive gathering in Jerusalem and violent clashes, such as attacks on police officers attempting arrests. Ultra-Orthodox leaders argue that prayer and Torah study are essential for Israel's defense, equating them with military might, while critics view the exemption as unfair and detrimental to national unity. The debate reflects deeper conflicts about Israel's identity as a Jewish state and the role of religion in public life, with lawmakers now considering a new draft bill to enforce conscription.",

  "background_read": [
    "Israel has a mandatory military service system where most Jewish citizens, both men and women, are required to serve for a period of time. The ultra-Orthodox community, however, has historically been exempt due to an agreement from 1948 that allowed full-time religious students to avoid service. This exemption has been controversial, with critics arguing it creates inequality and strains the military. The High Court of Justice has intervened multiple times, ruling the exemption illegal and pushing for reform. The issue gained urgency after recent wars, shifting public opinion toward greater inclusion. Ultra-Orthodox Jews, who make up about 13% of Israel's population, view religious study as a patriotic duty that safeguards the nation, leading to deep societal divisions."
