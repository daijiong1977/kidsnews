  "title": "Israel's Army Debate: Should Religious Students Serve?",
  "summary": "In Israel, there is a big argument about whether ultra-Orthodox Jewish men should join the army. For a long time, these men did not have to serve if they were studying religion full-time, but now the government wants to change that. This is causing problems because many ultra-Orthodox people believe their prayers and studies protect soldiers, so they should not have to fight. Protests have happened, with thousands of men gathering in Jerusalem, and some have even attacked police officers trying to arrest people who avoid the draft. The issue is making it hard for Prime Minister Netanyahu to keep the government together, as people disagree strongly. It's about balancing being a Jewish country with having a strong military that everyone helps.",

    "Israel is a country in the Middle East that has a military where most citizens must serve. Ultra-Orthodox Jews are a religious group that follows traditional Jewish laws very closely. For many years, ultra-Orthodox men were allowed to skip army service if they studied religion full-time, but now some people think this is unfair because others have to serve. This debate is about what it means to be a Jewish state and how to balance religious beliefs with national defense."
