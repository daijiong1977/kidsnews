  "title": "Pakistan Catches Bad Guys After Court Bombing",
  "summary": "In Pakistan, a very sad thing happened when a bomb exploded outside a court building in the capital city called Islamabad. This bomb hurt many people and made everyone scared. The police worked hard to find out who did this bad thing. They arrested four people who they think are responsible for the bombing. These people are called militants, which means they use violence to cause trouble. The bomb was set off by a suicide bomber, which is when someone kills themselves to hurt others. This event shows how important it is to keep people safe in public places like courts. The police are still investigating to make sure no more bad things happen. It's a reminder that violence is never the answer and that we should always try to solve problems peacefully.",
