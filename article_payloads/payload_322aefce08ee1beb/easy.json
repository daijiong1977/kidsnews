  "title": "Old Air Samples Show How Mosses Change with Climate",
  "summary": "Scientists in Sweden found a cool way to learn about climate change. They looked at old air samples collected by the military since the 1960s to check for nuclear fallout. These samples also had tiny bits of DNA from plants like mosses. By studying this DNA, the scientists discovered that mosses now release their spores, which are like tiny seeds, much earlier than before. In the past, mosses started releasing spores around a certain time, but now they do it about four weeks earlier. This change happens because autumns are getting warmer, giving mosses more time to grow before winter. The study helps us see how nature is changing quickly due to climate warming. It also shows that old samples can teach us new things about the environment.",

    "Climate change is when the Earth's temperature rises, often because of human activities like burning fuels. Mosses are small plants that don't have flowers or seeds; instead, they use spores to reproduce. Spores are like tiny dust particles that float in the air and help new mosses grow. Scientists study old things, like air samples, to understand how the environment has changed over time. This helps us protect nature and plan for the future."
