  "title": "Hidden Treasures Found While Building a Train",
  "summary": "Archaeologists found many old treasures while building a new train line called HS2 in the UK. They discovered 450,000 objects, including a Roman gladiator's tag, a very old hand axe, and gold dentures from the 1800s. These items are stored in a secret warehouse in Yorkshire for safety. The archaeologists worked hard to dig up these things to learn about Britain's past. Some people are happy about the finds, but others think the train line costs too much money and hurts the environment. The future of the treasures is still being decided.",

    "Archaeologists are scientists who dig up old objects to learn about history. In the UK, when big projects like train lines are built, they check the land first to save important old sites. HS2 is a new high-speed train that will connect London and Birmingham, but it has caused arguments because it is expensive and changes the land. The treasures found include things from different times, like ancient Rome and the 1800s, helping us understand how people lived long ago."
