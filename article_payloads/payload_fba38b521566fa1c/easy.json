  "title": "Why the White House Doesn't Want Sign Language at Events",
  "summary": "The Trump administration says that having American Sign Language interpreters at White House events, like press briefings, would make it hard for the President to control how he looks to the public. They are in a lawsuit with the National Association for the Deaf, which wants interpreters so deaf people can understand important news. The government argues that other ways, like online transcripts, are enough. A judge ordered the White House to provide interpreters, but they appealed and are still arguing about it. This is part of a bigger effort to stop diversity programs in the government.",

    "This article is about a legal fight between the Trump administration and deaf rights groups. American Sign Language helps deaf and hard-of-hearing people understand spoken words through hand signs. The White House holds events where the President talks to the public, and some people want interpreters there so everyone can follow along. The administration argues this interferes with how the President wants to be seen, while others say it's important for fairness and access. This is part of a larger debate about including all people in government communications."
