  "title": "Alcaraz Makes History as Youngest Career Grand Slam Winner",
  "summary": "Carlos Alcaraz, the Spanish world number one, has achieved a historic milestone in tennis by becoming the youngest man to complete the career Grand Slam. At just 22 years old, he secured his maiden Australian Open title with a victory over Novak Djokovic, marking his seventh major championship. This accomplishment places him among tennis legends like Djokovic, Rafael Nadal, Roger Federer, Andre Agassi, and Rod Laver as only the sixth man in the Open era to win all four Grand Slam tournaments. Alcaraz has demonstrated exceptional dominance, winning five of the last eight slams and losing only one of his eight major finals. He surpassed previous record-holder Rafael Nadal, who achieved the career Grand Slam at age 24, and also outdid Don Budge's record from 1938. With this win, Alcaraz now holds the most major singles titles before age 23 in the Open era, exceeding Bjorn Borg's six slams and far outpacing Djokovic's single major at that age. His journey includes two wins each at the French Open, Wimbledon, and US Open, with the Australian Open being his final hurdle. Alcaraz expressed his determination, stating he was 'hungry for more' this year, highlighting his relentless pursuit of excellence in the sport.",
