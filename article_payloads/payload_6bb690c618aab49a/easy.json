  "title": "Tiny Plastic Pieces Floating in City Air",
  "summary": "Scientists have found tiny plastic pieces called microplastics and nanoplastics floating in the air of cities. These plastics are so small you can't see them without a microscope. Researchers in China used a special computer tool to measure them in two big cities, Guangzhou and Xi'an. They discovered much more plastic in the air than people thought before. This is important because plastic in the air can affect the weather, nature, and our health. The study helps us understand where plastic comes from and how it moves around in the environment.",
