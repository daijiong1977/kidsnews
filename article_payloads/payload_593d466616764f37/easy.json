  "title": "Fibre: A Superfood for Your Body and Mind",
  "summary": "Fibre is a nutrient found in foods like fruits, vegetables, and whole grains that helps keep your body healthy. Many people are talking about fibre on social media because it has great benefits. Doctors say adults should eat 30 grams of fibre each day, but most people eat only half of that. Eating more fibre can help your gut work better, make your heart stronger, and even improve your mood. For example, a young woman named Yeshe felt tired and sad until she started eating more fibre-rich foods like porridge and beans. Now she feels happier and more energetic. Fibre is easy to add to meals, such as sprinkling seeds on breakfast or eating brown rice. It's a simple way to stay healthy and feel good every day.",

    "Fibre is a part of plants that our bodies cannot digest, but it helps food move through our system and keeps us healthy. It is found in foods like apples, carrots, beans, and whole wheat bread. Eating enough fibre can prevent tummy troubles and make you feel full longer. Many kids and adults don't eat enough fibre because they prefer sugary or processed foods. Learning about fibre can help you make better food choices and feel stronger and happier every day."
