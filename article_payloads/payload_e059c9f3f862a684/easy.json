  "title": "Why Living High Up Helps Keep People Healthy from Diabetes",
  "summary": "Scientists have found out why people who live in high places, like on tall mountains, get diabetes less often. In these high areas, there is less oxygen in the air. The research shows that red blood cells, which carry oxygen in our bodies, start to soak up sugar from the blood when oxygen is low. This is like a sponge soaking up water. By taking in sugar, the red blood cells help lower the amount of sugar in the blood, which can protect against diabetes. The scientists did experiments with mice to learn this. They saw that mice in low oxygen had less sugar in their blood because their red blood cells were using it. This discovery could help doctors find new ways to treat diabetes in the future.",

    "Diabetes is a common health problem where people have too much sugar in their blood, which can make them feel sick. Scientists study it to find ways to help people stay healthy. Red blood cells are important because they carry oxygen from our lungs to all parts of our body. In high places, like mountains, there is less oxygen, so our bodies have to work differently. This article talks about how scientists discovered that red blood cells can help lower blood sugar in these conditions, which might explain why people in high areas have less diabetes."
