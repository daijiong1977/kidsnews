  "title": "Solving the Mystery of Space Rays",
  "summary": "Scientists are close to solving a big space mystery that started over 100 years ago: where do cosmic rays come from? Cosmic rays are tiny, fast particles from space that hit Earth. A team at Michigan State University, led by Professor Shuo Zhang, studied these rays using special telescopes. They found clues that cosmic rays might come from powerful places like black holes or exploded stars. These places can make other particles called neutrinos, which pass through our bodies all the time. The research helps us learn about space and could answer questions about how galaxies form. By working together, scientists hope to find all the sources of cosmic rays soon.",

    "Cosmic rays are high-energy particles that come from space and have been a puzzle since 1912. Scientists study them to understand where they originate, such as from black holes or exploded stars. This research uses telescopes to look at X-rays and other signals from space. Learning about cosmic rays can help us know more about the universe and how galaxies are formed. It's like being a detective solving a big mystery in the sky!"
