  "title": "California Takes Away Driver's Licenses for Immigrants",
  "summary": "In California, the government has decided to take away 17,000 special driver's licenses from immigrants. These licenses are for people who drive big trucks and buses for work. This happened because the Trump administration was very critical of states like California for giving licenses to immigrants who are in the country without legal permission. Now, many immigrants might lose their jobs because they can't drive these vehicles anymore. It's a big change that affects families and workers in California. This story shows how laws can change and impact people's lives.",

    "In the United States, immigrants are people who come from other countries. Some immigrants do not have legal permission to be in the country, which means they are undocumented. States like California used to give driver's licenses to undocumented immigrants so they could drive legally for work. The Trump administration, which was the U.S. government under President Trump, did not like this and criticized California. As a result, California revoked many commercial driver's licenses, which are needed for jobs like truck driving. This affects immigrants' ability to work and support their families."
