  "Article_Structure": [
    "Main Points: The article details the careers and impacts of figures like Diane Keaton, Robert Redford, Pope Francis, and Ozzy Osbourne, emphasizing their roles in film, religion, and music. Purpose: Written to commemorate deaths in 2025, it aims to preserve legacies, educate on cultural significance, and provide a critical tribute. Evidence Evaluation: Sources include biographical facts, awards, and historical data, but lack direct citations, relying on journalistic synthesis; evidence is generally reliable but could benefit from more depth. Author Credibility: As BBC News, it implies journalistic standards, though author-specific expertise isn't highlighted, potentially introducing bias towards celebratory tones. Methodology: Information is gathered from public records, interviews, and archival research, presented narratively to engage readers. Critical Assessment: Strengths lie in comprehensive coverage and cultural context, but limitations include superficial analysis of controversies and over-reliance on positive narratives without deeper critique."
