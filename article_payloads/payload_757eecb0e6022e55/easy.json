  "title": "What We Know About Medical Cannabis: Good and Bad",
  "summary": "Medical cannabis is a plant-based medicine that many people use to help with problems like pain, anxiety, and trouble sleeping. Scientists from UCLA Health studied over 2,500 research papers to see if it really works. They found that only a few special cannabis medicines approved by the FDA are proven to help with specific illnesses, such as helping kids with severe seizures or patients with nausea from cancer treatment. For other issues like chronic pain, the evidence is not strong enough, and doctors do not recommend it as the first choice. The study also warns about risks: using high-strength cannabis, especially for teens, can lead to mental health problems like anxiety or psychosis, and daily use might hurt the heart. Doctors should talk to patients honestly about these benefits and dangers to keep them safe.",
