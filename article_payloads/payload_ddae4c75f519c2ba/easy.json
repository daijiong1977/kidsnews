  "title": "Why Some Family Doctors Choose Private Work",
  "summary": "This article talks about why more family doctors, called GPs, are choosing to work outside the NHS, which is the UK's public health service. Dr. Yvonne Girgis-Hanna is a GP who works privately because she finds NHS work too tiring and busy, with many patients and paperwork. Data shows that the number of doctors registering to work privately has gone up a lot in recent years. More patients are also paying to see private doctors for faster or special care. The article explains that private doctors can work in different areas like skin or women's health, and they might have more time for each patient. It helps us understand the reasons behind this change in healthcare.",

    "This article is about doctors in the UK who help families with health issues. The NHS is a big health system that gives free care, but some doctors are choosing to work privately where patients pay. This might be because NHS work can be very busy and stressful. Learning about this helps us understand how healthcare is changing and why people make different choices."
