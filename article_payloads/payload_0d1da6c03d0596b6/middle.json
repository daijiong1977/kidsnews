  "title": "Artemis II: NASA's Crewed Return to the Moon",
  "summary": "NASA's Artemis II mission marks the first crewed lunar flight in over five decades, with a potential launch window opening in February 2024 and extending into spring. This 10-day mission will carry four astronauts—commander Reid Wiseman, pilot Victor Glover, mission specialist Christina Koch, and Canadian mission specialist Jeremy Hansen—aboard the Space Launch System rocket and Orion capsule from Kennedy Space Center in Florida. The crew will test Orion's manual flight controls in Earth orbit, then travel thousands of kilometers beyond the Moon to evaluate life-support, propulsion, power, and navigation systems. They will also serve as medical test subjects, collecting data in deep space where radiation levels are higher than on the International Space Station but still safe. After completing their tasks, the astronauts will return to Earth with a splashdown in the Pacific Ocean. Artemis II is a critical step toward Artemis III, which aims for a human lunar landing by 2027 or 2028, reviving Moon exploration after the Apollo era.",

    "NASA's Artemis program aims to return humans to the Moon and establish sustainable exploration. The Apollo missions from 1969-1972 were the last crewed lunar landings. Artemis II builds on uncrewed tests, using the Space Launch System—the most powerful rocket ever built—and Orion, a capsule designed for deep space. This mission addresses challenges like radiation exposure and life-support in weightlessness, key for future Mars missions. International collaboration, such as with the Canadian Space Agency, highlights global efforts in space exploration."
