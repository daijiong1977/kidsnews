  "title": "NASA's Big Moon Trip: When and Who?",
  "summary": "NASA is planning a big space mission called Artemis II to go to the Moon. It might launch in February 2024 and last about 10 days. This is the first time in over 50 years that people will fly to the Moon. The mission has four astronauts: Reid Wiseman, Victor Glover, Christina Koch, and Jeremy Hansen. They will fly in a rocket from Florida and test a new spacecraft called Orion. The astronauts will practice flying, check systems, and send back data from space. After their trip, they will splash down in the Pacific Ocean. This mission helps prepare for future Moon landings.",
