  "summary": "In 2025, female artists like Taylor Swift, Olivia Dean, and Lola Young helped sell and stream more music in the UK than ever before. Taylor Swift's new album was the biggest seller, and other women had hit songs too. Oasis, a band from the past, also sold many albums because they went on a big tour again. Most music is listened to through streaming, where playing songs many times counts as sales. The British Phonographic Industry shared these numbers, showing that music is very popular. It was a great year for new female singers in the UK, with Olivia Dean making history by having a number one song and album at the same time.",
