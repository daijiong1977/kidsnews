  "title": "Should We Keep the Space Station in Space?",
  "summary": "Lawmakers in the United States are asking NASA to think about what happens to the International Space Station (ISS) when it stops working in 2030. The ISS is a big spacecraft where astronauts live and do science experiments in space. NASA's current plan is to bring it down to Earth in 2031 so it burns up in the atmosphere over the Pacific Ocean, where it won't hurt anyone. But some lawmakers want NASA to study if it's possible to move the ISS to a safe place in space instead, so it could be saved for future use. They say the ISS cost a lot of money and is an important achievement, so we should check all options before destroying it. This idea is part of a new bill that needs more votes to become law. The bill also includes other space plans, like using private rockets.",

    "The International Space Station (ISS) is a large spacecraft that orbits Earth, built by many countries including the United States. It has been used for over 20 years for science experiments and to learn about living in space. NASA is the American space agency that manages the ISS. In 2030, the ISS will stop working, and NASA plans to bring it down safely. Some people in government think we should check if we can keep it in space instead, because it cost a lot of money and is a big achievement. This is part of a new law being discussed in Congress."
