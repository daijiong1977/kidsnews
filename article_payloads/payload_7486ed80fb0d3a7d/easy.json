  "title": "President Trump and a Video with Racist Pictures",
  "summary": "President Donald Trump shared a video online that had a racist part showing Barack and Michelle Obama as apes. He said he didn't see that part before it was posted. The video was about voter fraud in the 2020 election. After people got upset, the video was removed from his account. A White House staffer posted it by mistake. Some Republican senators, like Tim Scott, said it was very racist. The video also showed other Democrats as animals. Trump explained that he only watched the beginning and gave it to his staff to check. He liked the message about voter fraud but said they should have taken it down if they saw the whole thing. The Obamas haven't said anything about it yet.",

    "This article is about a video shared by President Donald Trump that included racist images. Racism is when people are treated badly because of their skin color or race. In the past, black people have been compared to monkeys in hurtful ways. The video was posted on social media, which is a place online where people share pictures and videos. Trump was the president of the United States from 2017 to 2021, and Barack Obama was president before him from 2009 to 2017. The video caused a lot of anger because it used old racist ideas."
