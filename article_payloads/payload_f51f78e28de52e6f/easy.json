  "title": "Eurovision Changes Rules After Voting Problem",
  "summary": "Eurovision is a big singing contest where countries compete with songs. Recently, there was a problem with how people voted for Israel. Because of this, Eurovision has made new rules. Now, governments are not allowed to run big campaigns to get votes. Also, each fan can only cast a certain number of votes. This is to make the voting fair for everyone. The contest wants to be fun and fair for all countries. These changes help ensure that the best song wins, not just the one with the most promotion. It's important for competitions to have clear rules so everyone trusts the results.",

    "Eurovision is an annual song competition with countries from Europe and beyond. Each country sends a singer or band to perform a song, and viewers vote for their favorites. The contest started in 1956 and is very popular, with millions watching on TV. It's meant to bring people together through music, but sometimes voting can be unfair if some countries have advantages. The new rules aim to fix this by limiting how governments and fans can influence votes, making it more about the music."
