  "title": "Eurovision Changes Voting Rules After Problems",
  "summary": "The Eurovision Song Contest is changing its rules because some people were upset about how Israel did in the voting this year. Israel got the most votes from the public, which made some countries worry. Now, fans can only vote 10 times instead of 20, and juries are coming back for the semi-finals. Also, contestants and broadcasters are not allowed to have help from governments or other groups in promoting their songs. Last year, there were reports that the Israeli government paid for ads to get more votes. The director, Martin Green, said they got a lot of feedback and want to make sure the contest is fair and not influenced by outside groups. Some countries might boycott if Israel is in the contest next year because of the war in Gaza. The organizers hope the new rules will keep Eurovision a fun and neutral music event.",
