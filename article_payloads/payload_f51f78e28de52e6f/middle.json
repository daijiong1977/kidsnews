  "title": "Eurovision Implements Stricter Rules Following Voting Issues",
  "summary": "The Eurovision Song Contest has introduced new regulations in response to a voting controversy centered on Israel. These rules restrict government-led campaigns aimed at influencing votes and cap the number of votes individual fans can submit. The changes are designed to address concerns about fairness and integrity in the competition. Eurovision, known for its cultural significance and massive global audience, aims to uphold its reputation by ensuring that outcomes reflect musical merit rather than external pressures. This move follows incidents where excessive campaigning and voting imbalances raised questions about the contest's credibility. By implementing these measures, organizers hope to foster a more level playing field and maintain viewer trust. The adjustments are part of broader efforts to adapt the contest to modern challenges while preserving its core values of unity and entertainment.",

    "The Eurovision Song Contest is a long-standing international competition that began in 1956, organized by the European Broadcasting Union. It features participants from various countries performing original songs, with winners determined by a combination of jury and public votes. Over the years, it has grown into a major cultural event, but it has faced criticisms over voting biases and political influences. The recent controversy involving Israel highlighted issues with campaign efforts and vote stacking, leading to calls for reform. Understanding this context helps explain why the new rules focus on limiting external influences to preserve the contest's artistic and fair nature."
