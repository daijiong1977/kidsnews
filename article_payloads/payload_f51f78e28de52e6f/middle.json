  "title": "Eurovision Implements Rule Changes Following Voting Disputes",
  "summary": "The Eurovision Song Contest is updating its regulations in response to controversies surrounding Israel's performance in the recent competition. Israel secured the highest number of public votes in May, placing second overall after jury scores were factored in, which prompted concerns from several nations. Key changes include reducing the number of votes per fan from 20 to 10 and reinstating juries for the semi-finals. Additionally, a new ban prohibits contestants and broadcasters from engaging in promotional campaigns by third parties, such as governments, after reports emerged that an Israeli agency used state resources to encourage voting for its entry. Martin Green, the Eurovision director, cited extensive feedback from members and fans, emphasizing the need to review rules to prevent undue influence. He noted fears that third-party promotions, especially by governments, were disproportionate and undermined the contest's spirit. The issue is compounded by opposition to Israel's participation due to the Gaza conflict, with countries like Spain and Ireland threatening boycotts. Green hopes these measures will reassure participants of Eurovision's impartiality and neutrality, stressing that the contest should focus on music and unity, not geopolitics. A planned vote on Israel's involvement was cancelled in November and may be discussed later, reflecting ongoing tensions.",

    "The Eurovision Song Contest is a long-running international music competition started in 1956, managed by the European Broadcasting Union (EBU). It involves countries primarily from Europe and others like Australia, with each entry performing an original song. Voting combines scores from national juries and televotes from the public. Over the years, Eurovision has faced controversies, including political biases and external influences, such as bloc voting or government interventions. The contest aims to promote cultural exchange and unity, but real-world conflicts sometimes spill over, leading to debates about participation and fairness. This article discusses recent rule changes to address issues like third-party promotion, highlighting how global events, such as the Israel-Gaza conflict, can impact the competition's integrity."
