  "title": "UK Joins Big Wind Farm Plan with European Friends",
  "summary": "The UK is joining a big project with nine other European countries to build many new wind farms in the North Sea. These wind farms will use special underwater cables called interconnectors to share electricity between countries. The government says this will help make energy safer and cheaper by using more wind power instead of fossil fuels like oil and gas. Some people think it could lower bills, but others worry it might make electricity prices go up if wind farms sell power to the highest bidder. The plan aims to be finished by 2050, and it includes countries like Norway, Germany, and the Netherlands. This is the first time wind farms will be directly connected to multiple countries, which could help smooth out energy supply and reduce waste.",

    "Wind farms are groups of tall turbines that spin in the wind to make clean electricity without pollution. Countries in Europe are working together to build more of these in the sea to reduce reliance on fossil fuels like coal and oil, which harm the environment. Sharing electricity through cables can help when one country has extra power, making energy supply more stable and cheaper for everyone."
