  "title": "Rise in Driving Test Cheating with Technology and Impersonation",
  "summary": "Cheating during driving tests in England, Scotland, and Wales increased by 47% in the year to September 2025, with 2,844 recorded attempts. Data from the Driving and Vehicle Standards Agency (DVSA) shows that over 1,100 cases involved technology, such as Bluetooth earpieces connected to hidden phones, primarily used during theory tests to receive answers. Additionally, more than 1,000 incidents involved impersonation, where individuals pretended to be registered candidates for theory or practical tests. Industry experts attribute the surge to a nationwide shortage of driving tests, leading to desperation among candidates. The DVSA cites improved detection methods and a general rise in cheating. Dr. Rasha Kassem from Aston University highlights the severe risks, including increased accidents, injuries, and fatalities, as cheaters may lack proper driving skills. Cheating is classified as fraud, with penalties ranging from driving bans to prison sentences. In response, test centers have implemented measures like facial recognition and checking for concealed devices. Last year, 96 people were prosecuted, including cases like Qounain Khan, who received an eight-month prison sentence for multiple impersonations.",

    "Driving tests in the UK are administered by the DVSA to ensure road safety. A theory test assesses knowledge of rules, while a practical test evaluates driving skills. Recently, a shortage of test slots has created backlogs, increasing pressure on candidates. Cheating methods have evolved with technology, such as Bluetooth devices, posing new challenges for enforcement. Fraud in this context is taken seriously due to the potential for harm, with legal frameworks in place to deter and punish offenders. Public awareness campaigns aim to educate on the dangers and consequences of cheating."
