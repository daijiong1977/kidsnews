  "title": "Cheating on Driving Tests is Increasing",
  "summary": "In England, Scotland, and Wales, cheating during driving tests went up by almost 50% last year. People are using Bluetooth headsets to get help on theory tests or pretending to be someone else to take tests for them. Over 1,100 cases involved technology like hidden phones and earpieces. More than 1,000 times, people tried to take tests while pretending to be the real candidate. Experts say this is dangerous because drivers who cheat might not know how to drive safely, leading to accidents, injuries, or even deaths. Cheating is a crime, and people caught can get in big trouble, like going to jail or not being allowed to drive. To stop cheating, test centers check IDs and make sure people aren't hiding anything. Last year, 96 people were prosecuted for cheating.",
