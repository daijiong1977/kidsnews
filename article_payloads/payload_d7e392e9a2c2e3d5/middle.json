  "title": "Shein Founder Reaffirms Chinese Ties Amid Global Expansion",
  "summary": "Xu Yangtian, the founder of Shein, made a rare public appearance at a business conference in Guangdong, China, to emphasize the company's deep roots in the country. He announced a 10 billion yuan investment aimed at creating a high-tech fashion hub in Guangdong, which is a key manufacturing region for Shein's fast-fashion operations. Xu praised the Chinese government and local officials for providing a supportive business environment and a complete industrial ecosystem that has been crucial to Shein's success, including supporting over 600,000 jobs. This speech comes as Shein has been shifting its focus away from China, having moved its headquarters to Singapore and exploring stock market listings in New York and London. The appearance was widely covered on Chinese social media and news outlets, marking a strategic move to reaffirm ties with Beijing amid growing scrutiny of Chinese firms in the West. Shein faces challenges from trade policies, such as US measures affecting low-value parcels, which impact its export business. Xu's remarks highlight the balance between global expansion and maintaining strong connections to China's manufacturing base.",
