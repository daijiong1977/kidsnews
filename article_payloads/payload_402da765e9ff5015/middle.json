  "title": "Brigitte Bardot: From Screen Icon to Animal Rights Advocate",
  "summary": "Brigitte Bardot, a French actress born in 1934, rose to international fame in the 1950s with her role in 'And God Created Woman,' directed by her husband Roger Vadim. This film, part of the French New Wave, showcased her sensual and carefree persona, redefining femininity and making her a sensation at Cannes. Throughout the late 1950s and 1960s, she starred in critically acclaimed films like 'The Truth,' 'Contempt,' and 'Viva Maria!,' demonstrating her range from dramatic to comedic roles. Bardot's style, including her tousled hair and bold eyeliner, influenced global fashion trends. In 1973, at age 39, she retired from acting to focus on animal rights, founding the Brigitte Bardot Foundation. She campaigned against seal hunting and animal testing, shifting from a cinematic icon to a dedicated activist. Bardot settled in Saint-Tropez, living a quieter life until her death at 91, leaving a legacy of glamour, controversy, and conviction.",
