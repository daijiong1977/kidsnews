  "title": "Navigating Class Barriers at Cambridge University",
  "summary": "Jade Franks, a working-class student from Merseyside, enrolled at the University of Cambridge to study theatre and education after outreach assistance. Despite her academic ambitions, she felt isolated due to her background, as peers mocked her scouse accent and questioned her schooling. Social events highlighted class differences, such as when her sister was forced to wear a gown at a formal dinner for inappropriate attire, an incident Jade described as dehumanizing and misogynistic. Financially strained, Jade worked part-time cleaning toilets and for a punting company, unaware of grant eligibility until her final year, violating university rules against student employment. Her experiences reveal systemic classism and financial pressures in elite institutions, yet she remained determined to join Footlights, the university drama group. This narrative underscores the challenges faced by non-traditional students in navigating academic and social environments at prestigious universities.",
