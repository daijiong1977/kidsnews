  "title": "Jade's Journey at Cambridge University",
  "summary": "Jade Franks went to Cambridge University to study theatre and education. She was older and from a working-class family, which made her feel different from other students. They made fun of her accent and clothes. Jade had to clean toilets to pay for her rent because she didn't know she could get money help. She felt lonely and almost left, but she kept going. Her sister visited and was told to cover up with a gown at a dinner, which made them feel bad. Jade worked hard and wanted to join a drama group. This story shows how people can face challenges but still follow their dreams.",
