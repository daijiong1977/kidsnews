  "title": "Class Disparity and Institutional Challenges at Cambridge University",
  "summary": "Jade Franks, a working-class student from Merseyside, gained admission to the University of Cambridge through outreach support, pursuing a degree in theatre and education. Her experience was marred by pervasive classism, as evidenced by peers deriding her scouse accent, inquiring about her schooling, and mocking her contributions to social events. A poignant incident involved her sister being compelled to wear a gown at a formal dinner for perceived inappropriate attire, which Franks criticized as dehumanizing and misogynistic, reflecting deeper institutional biases. Financially constrained, Franks undertook clandestine part-time employment as a cleaner and for a punting company, contravening university policies that prohibit student work to ensure academic focus, and she remained unaware of grant eligibility until her final year. This narrative elucidates the intersection of socioeconomic status, gender, and academic integration, underscoring the systemic obstacles faced by non-traditional students in elite educational settings. Despite these adversities, Franks aspired to join Footlights, symbolizing resilience and the pursuit of extracurricular engagement amidst structural inequities.",
