  "title": "A Simple Chemical Change to Make Quantum Computers Better",
  "summary": "Quantum computers are special machines that can solve very hard problems, like finding new medicines or keeping secrets safe. They need special materials called topological superconductors, but these are tricky to make. Scientists at the University of Chicago and West Virginia University found a cool way to create these materials. They used two elements, tellurium and selenium, in a thin film. By changing how much of each element they used, they could make the material act like a topological superconductor. This helps electrons inside the material work together just right. The scientists say this is like turning a dial to get the perfect setting. This discovery could help build better quantum computers in the future, making them more stable and easier to use.",
