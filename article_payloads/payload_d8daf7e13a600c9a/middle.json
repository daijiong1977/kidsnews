  "title": "Chemical Tuning Advances Quantum Computing Materials",
  "summary": "Quantum computers have the potential to tackle complex tasks like drug discovery and encryption breaking, but they rely on topological superconductors, which are rare and difficult to produce. Researchers from the University of Chicago Pritzker School of Molecular Engineering and West Virginia University have developed a practical method to create these materials. They focused on ultra-thin films made of tellurium and selenium, adjusting the ratio of these elements to manipulate electron interactions. This tuning allows the material to enter a topological superconducting state, where electrons correlate in a way that stabilizes quantum properties. The material, iron telluride selenide, combines superconductivity with topological behavior, making it ideal for quantum applications. Thin films offer advantages such as higher operating temperatures up to 13 Kelvin, greater uniformity, and compatibility with device fabrication. This research, published in Nature Communications, provides a tool for designing materials needed for next-generation quantum computers, enabling more stable and efficient quantum devices.",
