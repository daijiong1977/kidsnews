  "title": "Shape-Shifting Molecules for Smarter Computers",
  "summary": "Scientists are looking for new materials to make computers smarter and faster, moving beyond the silicon used today. They have created tiny molecules that can change their behavior, acting like memory, logic gates, or even parts that learn, all in one device. This is inspired by how our brains work, where learning happens naturally in the material itself. The research comes from the Indian Institute of Science, where a team led by Sreetosh Goswami designed these molecules using chemistry. By adjusting the molecules' shape and environment, they can control how electrons move, allowing the devices to switch between digital and analog modes. This could lead to future AI hardware that is more energy-efficient and intelligent, with learning built directly into the material. The team is now working to put these molecules on silicon chips to create better computers.",

    "Computers today use silicon chips to process information, but scientists want to make them smarter and more like our brains. Our brains can learn and remember things naturally, without needing separate parts for memory and thinking. This research explores tiny molecules that can change how they work, helping create future computers that learn on their own and use less energy. It's part of a field called neuromorphic computing, which tries to build hardware inspired by the brain's abilities."
