  "title": "Cancer Cases Are Rising Around the World",
  "summary": "Cancer is a serious disease that is affecting more and more people all over the world. Since 1990, the number of people getting cancer has more than doubled, reaching 18.5 million new cases in 2023. Sadly, about 10.4 million people die from cancer each year. Most of these cases and deaths happen in poorer countries. The good news is that many cancer deaths could be prevented. Over 40% of cancer deaths are linked to things we can change, like smoking, eating unhealthy foods, and having high blood sugar. By 2050, experts think cancer cases could rise to 30.5 million per year. To help, governments need to work on preventing cancer, finding it early, and making sure everyone can get treatment.",
