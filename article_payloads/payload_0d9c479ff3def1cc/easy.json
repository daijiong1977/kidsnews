  "title": "A New Treatment for Leukaemia on the NHS",
  "summary": "Oscar Murphy, a 28-year-old man, was the first patient to get a new treatment called CAR-T therapy on the NHS for his leukaemia, a type of blood cancer. He said it was fantastic and very sci-fi. This treatment uses his own immune cells, which are changed in a lab to fight the cancer. It happened at Manchester Royal Infirmary hospital. The NHS is now funding this treatment to help about 50 patients each year. Oscar had leukaemia that came back after other treatments, but this new therapy gave him hope. Doctors say it is safer and works better than old treatments, helping patients live longer. It is a big step in fighting this fast-acting cancer.",
