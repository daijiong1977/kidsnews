  "title": "A 2,400-Year-Old Boat with a Fingerprint",
  "summary": "Scientists found a 2,400-year-old boat in Denmark called the Hjortspring boat. It was used by warriors who attacked an island but lost. The boat was discovered in a bog and has been a mystery for over 100 years because no one knew where it came from. Researchers used new science to study the boat's waterproofing material, which was made from animal fat and pine pitch. Pine trees were rare in Denmark back then, so the boat might have been built in eastern areas near the Baltic Sea. This means the warriors could have sailed a long way. They also found a human fingerprint in the tar, which is very rare and gives a direct link to the ancient people who used the boat. The study helps solve the old mystery of the boat's origins.",

    "The Hjortspring boat is an ancient wooden boat found in Denmark. It was used by warriors over 2,000 years ago during a battle. After the warriors lost, the boat was sunk in a bog as a thank-you gift to the gods. For many years, people wondered where the boat came from because the weapons found with it were common in Northern Europe. Scientists recently studied materials from the boat, like tar and ropes, to learn more. They found a fingerprint in the tar, which is exciting because it connects us directly to the past. This helps us understand ancient travel and battles better."
