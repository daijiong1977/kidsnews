  "title": "Game of Thrones Stage Adaptation Announced for Summer Premiere",
  "summary": "The Royal Shakespeare Company (RSC) has announced that a new play, Game of Thrones: The Mad King, will premiere in Stratford-upon-Avon this summer. Created in collaboration with HBO, this stage prequel is set 10 years prior to the events of George RR Martin's original books and TV series, featuring an original story based on new material from Martin. The play will debut at the Royal Shakespeare Theatre, with tickets available from April. Martin expressed enthusiasm for the adaptation, highlighting the RSC's artistic lineage from Shakespeare to modern writers like himself and noting the unique challenges of staging battles. Adapted by Duncan Macmillan and directed by Dominic Cooke, the plot centers on a tournament during a thawing winter, where great houses gather amid hope, but darker purposes and a treasonous plot against the Mad King unfold. Themes include family bonds, prophecies, and power struggles, exploring survival in a live theatrical environment that merges fantasy with Shakespearean tradition.",
