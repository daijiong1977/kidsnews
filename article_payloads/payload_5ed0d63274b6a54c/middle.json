  "title": "ByteDance Responds to Disney's Legal Threats Over AI Video App",
  "summary": "ByteDance, a Chinese technology giant, has committed to curbing its AI video-making tool Seedance following legal threats from Disney and complaints from other entertainment studios. The controversy arose after videos created with Seedance 2.0, launched on February 12, went viral online for their realism. Disney sent a cease-and-desist letter accusing ByteDance of providing a 'pirated library' of copyrighted characters, including Marvel superheroes and Star Wars figures, and described it as a 'virtual smash-and-grab' of intellectual property. In response, ByteDance stated it respects intellectual property rights and is strengthening safeguards to prevent unauthorized use, though it did not specify details. The app generates videos from text prompts, and clips featuring characters like Anakin Skywalker and Spider-Man have been found online. ByteDance had previously paused user uploads of real people's images and emphasizes its commitment to copyright protection. This incident highlights ongoing tensions between AI innovation and copyright enforcement in the entertainment industry.",
