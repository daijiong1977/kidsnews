  "title": "ByteDance Stops AI Videos After Disney Complains",
  "summary": "ByteDance, a big tech company from China, has promised to limit its AI video app called Seedance. This happened after Disney, a famous entertainment company, threatened to take legal action. Disney said Seedance was using its characters like Marvel superheroes and Star Wars figures without permission. Many people online have been making videos with Seedance that look very real, but this has worried Hollywood studios. ByteDance says it respects copyrights and is working to stop users from misusing others' property. They have already stopped users from uploading real people's images. The app creates videos from text prompts, and some clips have become very popular. ByteDance did not share details about how it will protect copyrights.",

    "This article is about a conflict between a tech company and an entertainment giant over copyright issues. ByteDance created an AI app that makes videos, but Disney accused it of using copyrighted characters without permission. Copyright means you need permission to use someone else's creative work, like characters from movies. AI tools like Seedance can create realistic videos from text, which is new and exciting but can cause problems if not used properly. Companies like ByteDance must follow rules to protect others' property."
