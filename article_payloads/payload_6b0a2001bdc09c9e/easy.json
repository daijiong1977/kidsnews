  "summary": "The FIFA video game is returning in 2026 after being gone for four years. It used to be made by a company called EA, but they stopped using the FIFA name in 2023. Now, Netflix, which is known for movies and shows, will have the new FIFA game. It will be made by a studio called Delphi Interactive and will be free for Netflix members. The game is coming out before the 2026 World Cup, a big football tournament. Some fans are happy, but others are unsure because Netflix focuses on mobile games.

    "FIFA is a famous video game about football that many people have played for years. It started in 1993 and had millions of players. In 2023, the company EA stopped using the FIFA name and called their game EA Sports FC instead. Now, Netflix, which usually makes TV shows and movies, is teaming up with a new studio to bring back the FIFA game. This is exciting because it will be free for Netflix users, but some fans worry because Netflix is new to making big video games."
