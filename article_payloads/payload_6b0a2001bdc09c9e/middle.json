  "title": "FIFA's Video Game Revival: Netflix Takes Over After EA Split",
  "summary": "The FIFA video game franchise is set to return in 2026 after a four-year hiatus, following a contentious split with its longtime developer, Electronic Arts (EA). EA discontinued using the FIFA branding in 2023, rebranding its football game as EA Sports FC, which remained popular, topping UK sales in 2023. Netflix has secured exclusive rights to the new FIFA game, which will be developed and published by Delphi Interactive, a studio yet to release a game. The game will launch ahead of the 2026 World Cup and be free for Netflix members. FIFA president Gianni Infantino expressed enthusiasm for this partnership, calling it a new era for digital football. However, reactions are mixed, with some fans skeptical about Netflix's mobile-first approach and the capabilities of Delphi Interactive. The original FIFA series, started by EA in 1993, had around 150 million players, highlighting its historical significance in gaming.",

    "The FIFA video game series, launched by Electronic Arts in 1993, became one of the most successful gaming franchises, with around 150 million players. In 2023, EA ended its partnership with FIFA due to expensive licensing fees, rebranding its game as EA Sports FC, which continued to sell well. This split created an opportunity for new partnerships. Netflix, expanding into gaming, has secured exclusive rights to revive the FIFA brand, partnering with Delphi Interactive, a studio without prior releases. The move aims to leverage the 2026 World Cup for global appeal, but it raises questions about Netflix's gaming strategy and Delphi's experience. Understanding this context helps explain the significance and potential challenges of this revival."
