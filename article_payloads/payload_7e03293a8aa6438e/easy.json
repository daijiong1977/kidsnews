  "title": "Government Stops Money for Minnesota Health Program",
  "summary": "The government has decided to stop giving $259 million to Minnesota for a health program called Medicaid because they think there might be fraud. Vice President J.D. Vance announced this, saying the government's job is to stop fraud and protect people. Minnesota's governor, Tim Walz, disagrees and says this is a political move to punish the state, not really about fraud. The money helps children and elderly people get healthcare, so stopping it could hurt them. This is part of a bigger argument between the Trump administration and Democrats over how to handle welfare programs and immigration. The article explains both sides of the story.",

    "Medicaid is a U.S. government program that helps pay for medical care for people who have low incomes or disabilities. It is run by both the federal government and states. Fraud means someone is cheating to get money unfairly. In politics, sometimes decisions are made to help one side win arguments, which is called being politically motivated. This article talks about a fight over money for healthcare in Minnesota."
