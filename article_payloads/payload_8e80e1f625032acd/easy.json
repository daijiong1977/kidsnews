  "summary": "This article tells the story of Gabriela, a woman who loves exercising and has a fit body. She wanted to lose a little weight after the Covid pandemic but found it hard. Her friends told her about special injections called weight-loss jabs that help people feel less hungry. Even though she was already healthy, Gabriela started using these jabs without a doctor's help. She lost weight quickly but gained it back when she stopped. Now, she uses the jabs on and off to look the way she wants. Doctors warn that this can be dangerous because the jabs are meant for people who are very overweight, not for those who are already fit. The article explains that in some places, like the UK, doctors only give these jabs to people with high BMI numbers, which measure body size. Gabriela's BMI was not high, so she didn't need them. This story shows how some people might take risks with their health to change how they look.",

    "Weight-loss jabs are medicines that help people who are very overweight by making them feel full so they eat less. They are usually given by doctors to those with health problems related to weight. BMI is a way to check if someone's weight is healthy based on their height. For example, a high BMI might mean a person needs help to lose weight. It's important to use these jabs only with a doctor's advice to avoid health risks like sickness or other problems. This article talks about people who use them even when they don't need to, which can be unsafe."
