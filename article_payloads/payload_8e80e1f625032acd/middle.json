  "title": "The Risks of Off-Label Weight-Loss Injections",
  "summary": "This article explores the trend of people using weight-loss injections, like Ozempic, without medical necessity. It focuses on Gabriela, a 40-year-old Brazilian lawyer and fitness enthusiast who struggled to lose a few kilograms gained during the Covid pandemic. Despite her active lifestyle and muscular build, she turned to weight-loss jabs after friends recommended them. She purchased Ozempic without a prescription in Rio de Janeiro and experienced rapid weight loss by reducing her appetite, but the effects reversed when she stopped. Gabriela now cycles on and off the injections based on her body image, using them intermittently for over a year. Doctors caution that such behavior poses health risks, as these drugs are intended for individuals with high BMI or weight-related conditions. In the UK, the NHS restricts prescriptions to those with BMI above 35 or 40, emphasizing that misuse can lead to adverse effects. Gabriela's BMI was 26.6, indicating she was not medically eligible, highlighting concerns about off-label use and the importance of clinical supervision for safety.",

    "Weight-loss injections, such as Ozempic, are drugs designed to help manage obesity by imitating hormones like GLP-1 that regulate appetite and insulin. They are typically prescribed for people with high BMI or diabetes to reduce food intake and promote weight loss. However, off-label use—where people take them without medical need—is rising, driven by social influences and body image pressures. This can lead to health risks like nutritional deficiencies, side effects, and weight rebound. BMI categories define underweight, normal, overweight, and obese ranges, with thresholds varying by ethnicity. Clinical supervision is crucial to monitor for adverse effects and ensure proper use. The article highlights real-world cases where individuals bypass medical guidelines, emphasizing the need for public awareness on safe practices."
