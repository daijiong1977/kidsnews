  "title": "NASA Completes Roman Space Telescope After Challenges and Delays",
  "summary": "NASA has completed assembly of the Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope, a new observatory named after NASA's first chief astronomer. Technicians in Maryland finished connecting its inner and outer portions, marking a milestone with launch planned for fall 2026. The telescope underwent rigorous testing, including thermal vacuum chambers, to ensure it can withstand rocket launch conditions. Compared to the James Webb Space Telescope, which faced over 10 years of delays and cost $11 billion, Roman is less complex with a smaller mirror but offers a wider field of view. It will conduct a cosmic census of billions of stars and galaxies, aiding research into dark matter and dark energy, which constitute about 95% of the universe. Roman features advanced detectors in its Wide Field Instrument, forming a 300-megapixel camera sensitive to visible and near-infrared light, similar to night vision goggles. This technology allows it to capture images with resolution comparable to Hubble but over a much larger area, such as expanding Hubble's Ultra Deep Field by 100 times. Additionally, Roman includes a coronagraph to photograph faint planets around stars. The project faced ordinary challenges, according to officials, and represents a significant step in space exploration.",

    "The Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope is part of NASA's efforts to advance astronomical research. Named after Nancy Grace Roman, a pioneering astronomer, it follows telescopes like Hubble and James Webb. Hubble, launched in 1990, has provided high-resolution images but with a narrow field of view. James Webb, launched in 2021, focuses on deep space observations but is complex and costly. Roman aims to bridge gaps by offering wide-field imaging to study large-scale cosmic structures. It addresses key questions in astrophysics, such as the nature of dark matter and dark energy, which are invisible components influencing the universe's expansion. The telescope's development involved overcoming technical challenges, similar to other NASA missions, highlighting the perseverance required in space exploration."
