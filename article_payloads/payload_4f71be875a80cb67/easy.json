  "title": "A New Space Telescope is Ready to Explore the Stars",
  "summary": "NASA has finished building a new space telescope called the Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope. It is named after NASA's first chief astronomer. The telescope was put together in Maryland and tested to make sure it can survive a rocket launch. It is scheduled to launch in fall 2026. This telescope will take pictures of the Milky Way galaxy and help scientists learn about stars and galaxies. It is simpler than another big telescope called James Webb, but it can see a wider area of the sky. This will help study dark matter and dark energy, which are mysterious parts of the universe. The telescope has special detectors that work like night vision goggles to see faint light. It will take sharp pictures similar to the Hubble Space Telescope but cover more of the sky. Scientists are excited because it will help us understand space better.",
