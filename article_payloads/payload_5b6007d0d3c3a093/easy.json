  "title": "A Wobbly Black Hole Jet Affects a Galaxy",
  "summary": "In space, some galaxies have a super bright center called an active galactic nucleus, powered by a supermassive black hole. This black hole pulls in gas and dust, releasing energy that can create jets shooting out from the galaxy. Astronomers led by Justin Kader studied a nearby galaxy named VV 340a and found that its black hole jet is wobbling like a spinning top. This wobbling jet pushes gas out of the galaxy at a fast rate, about 19 suns' worth of mass each year. When gas is pushed out, it can't be used to make new stars, so this affects how many stars the galaxy can form in the future. The scientists used telescopes like the James Webb Space Telescope to see through dust and observe this process, helping us understand how black holes change galaxies over time.",

    "Galaxies are huge collections of stars, gas, and dust held together by gravity. Black holes are invisible objects with very strong gravity that can pull in nearby material. When a black hole is active, it can create jets of energy that affect the galaxy around it. Astronomers use telescopes to study these processes and learn how galaxies change over billions of years."
