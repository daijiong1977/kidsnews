  "title": "A Rusty Car from James Bond Movies Becomes a Million-Pound Treasure",
  "summary": "This story is about a special car called an Aston Martin DB5 that was in James Bond movies like Goldfinger. A man named John Williams bought it long ago for £985, but he stopped driving it and left it outside to get rusty. Kids in the neighborhood even played on it, thinking it might have cool gadgets like in the movies. The car was very old and rare, with only 39 like it in the world. John and his wife Susan decided to save money to fix it up at Aston Martin's workshop. It took three years and cost £400,000 to repair, but now the car is worth £1 million. They got offers to sell it, but they chose to keep it because it was unique and special to them.",
