  "title": "Sinner Advances to Australian Open Quarter-Finals with Strong Performance",
  "summary": "Jannik Sinner, the defending champion at the Australian Open, demonstrated a rejuvenated form as he advanced to the quarter-finals with a straight-sets victory over fellow Italian Luciano Darderi. After a challenging third-round match where he faced extreme heat and cramping, Sinner appeared fresher and more assured, winning 6-1, 6-3, 7-6 (7-2). Despite some fatigue in the third set, where Darderi forced a tie-break, Sinner elevated his game to secure his 18th consecutive win at Melbourne Park. He acknowledged the difficulty of the match, noting their friendship off-court and his relief at closing it in three sets. Sinner is now set to face either Ben Shelton or Casper Ruud in the next round, as he aims to become only the second man after Novak Djokovic to win three successive Australian Open titles. This performance highlights his resilience and competitive edge in the tournament.",
