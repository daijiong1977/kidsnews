  "title": "Stan Wawrinka Gets Special Invite to Australian Open in His Last Year",
  "summary": "Stan Wawrinka is a famous tennis player who has won big tournaments called Grand Slams. He is 40 years old and will retire after the 2026 season. The Australian Open, a major tennis event, gave him a wildcard, which is a special invitation to play even though he is not ranked high enough. Wawrinka is happy because he won his first Grand Slam title at the Australian Open in 2014. Another player, Nick Kyrgios, decided not to play singles because he is not ready for long matches. He will play doubles instead. This helps the tournament director avoid a tough decision about who gets the last wildcards.",
