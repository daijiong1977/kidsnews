  "title": "Wawrinka Receives Australian Open Wildcard Amid Career Finale and Kyrgios' Decision",
  "summary": "Stan Wawrinka, a three-time Grand Slam champion and former world number three, has been granted a wildcard entry to the Australian Open as he approaches the final season of his professional career, set to end in 2026. At 40 years old, Wawrinka expressed gratitude for this opportunity, recalling his first major victory at Melbourne Park in 2014. Currently ranked 156th globally, his recent title win was in 2017. Meanwhile, Australian player Nick Kyrgios, ranked 670th due to injury struggles, opted out of the men's singles competition, citing unpreparedness for five-set matches. Instead, he will compete in men's doubles, where he previously triumphed in 2022. This decision alleviated pressure on tournament director Craig Tiley, who faced a contentious choice in allocating the remaining wildcards. The article highlights the emotional and strategic aspects of professional tennis transitions.",
