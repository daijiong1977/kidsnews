  "title": "The Rise of Billionaire Influence in American Politics",
  "summary": "This article examines how a new class of billionaires has gained significant political influence in the United States, particularly through campaign spending. It highlights that in 2024, the wealthiest 100 Americans spent over $1 billion on federal elections, a dramatic increase from $46 million in 2004. This surge is attributed to the growth of the billionaire class, with Forbes reporting 902 billionaires in the U.S., more than any other country. Additionally, court rulings have loosened campaign finance regulations, allowing billionaires to contribute unlimited amounts to super PACs. The article notes public skepticism, with 58% of respondents in a poll viewing billionaire campaign spending as harmful. Through an interview with reporter Beth Reinhard, it explores the intersection of money and politics, emphasizing how this trend solidifies power for the ultra-rich during election seasons.",
