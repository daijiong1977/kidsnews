  "title": "NASA's Big Moon Rocket is Ready for Launch",
  "summary": "NASA has moved a huge rocket to the launch pad in Florida to prepare for a special mission to the Moon. This rocket, called the Space Launch System, is very tall and was carried slowly on a big machine over many hours. Four astronauts will ride on this rocket for the Artemis II mission, which will take them around the Moon but not land on it. This is exciting because it's the first time people will go to the Moon in over 50 years since the Apollo missions. The rocket will do some final tests, like a dress rehearsal, before it can launch as early as February. The astronauts watched the rocket move and are getting ready for their journey into space.",

    "NASA is a space agency that sends rockets and astronauts to explore space. The Moon is Earth's closest neighbor in space, and people first landed there in 1969. The Artemis missions are new trips to the Moon to learn more and maybe build a base there someday. Rockets are big machines that use fuel to fly up into space, and astronauts are brave people who train for years to go on these missions."
