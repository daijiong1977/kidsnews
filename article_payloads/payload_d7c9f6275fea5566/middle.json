  "title": "Harry Styles Teases Fourth Album with Global Campaign",
  "summary": "Harry Styles has sparked speculation about his musical return after a four-year hiatus by launching a cryptic marketing campaign. Billboards with the message 'we belong together' and an image from his 2022-23 world tour have appeared in major cities worldwide, including New York, Manchester, Palermo, São Paulo, and Berlin. Simultaneously, a website branded similarly went live, featuring a WhatsApp group chat named 'HSHQ' (Harry Styles Headquarters). Fans interpret these moves as hints toward the announcement of his fourth album, following his last release, Harry's House, which earned Brit and Grammy Awards in 2022. Styles, who rose to fame with One Direction, has been involved in other activities recently, such as marathon running, including participating in the Tokyo and Berlin Marathons. He was also seen at significant events like the papal announcement in St. Peter's Square and spending time with actress Zoe Kravitz. Despite these diversions, it is believed he has been working on new music since concluding his Love On Tour three years ago. Initial recording sessions were confirmed in August 2024 at London's RAK Studios, and rumors suggest the album might be written on a typewriter, though sources are questionable. Additionally, reports indicate potential residencies at venues like Madison Square Garden and Manchester's Co-op Live arena, where Styles is an investor. His comeback was subtly hinted at in a YouTube video titled 'Forever, Forever' released in December, showcasing fan moments from his tour's final date in Italy.",
