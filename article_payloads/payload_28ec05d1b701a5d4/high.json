  "summary": "Faye Tozer, renowned as a member of the iconic pop group Steps, is poised to undertake a significant theatrical endeavor by joining the cast of Mean Girls: The Musical for its inaugural UK and Republic of Ireland tour. At age 50, she will embody three distinct characters: the mothers of protagonists Cady Heron and Regina George, alongside the maths teacher Ms Norbury, showcasing her versatility in a production adapted from the 2004 cinematic satire by Tina Fey. The tour, commencing at Wolverhampton Grand Theatre on June 23 and encompassing 18 additional venues such as Manchester and Canterbury, aims to capitalize on the musical's critical acclaim and cultural resonance. Supporting cast members include Kiara Dario as Gretchen and Sophie Pourret as Karen, enhancing the ensemble's dynamic. Tozer's recent performance in the West End burlesque show Diamonds And Dust underscores her adaptability across genres, while her pop music legacy with Steps provides a unique draw for audiences. This casting decision reflects broader trends in entertainment where established musicians transition to stage roles, potentially broadening demographic appeal and reinforcing the musical's thematic exploration of adolescent social hierarchies and identity.",
