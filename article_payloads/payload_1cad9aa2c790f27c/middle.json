  "title": "NASA Satellite Reveals Unexpected Tsunami Behavior",
  "summary": "In late July, a powerful magnitude 8.8 earthquake struck the Kuril-Kamchatka subduction zone off Russia, generating a major tsunami across the Pacific Ocean. The SWOT satellite, a joint NASA and French mission launched in 2022, was fortuitously positioned to capture high-resolution data of this event. Instead of observing a simple, non-dispersive wave as traditional models predict, the satellite revealed an intricate pattern of waves that spread, interacted, and scattered. Researchers, led by Angel Ruiz-Angulo, combined this satellite data with measurements from DART buoys to refine estimates of the earthquake and analyze the tsunami's behavior. This challenged the long-held scientific view that large tsunamis travel as stable, single waves. The findings suggest that dispersion—where waves break into multiple components—plays a significant role, potentially affecting how tsunamis impact coastlines. SWOT's ability to capture wide swaths of ocean surface with unprecedented detail offers new insights, likened to 'a new pair of glasses,' that could improve tsunami modeling and forecasting for better coastal safety.",

    "Tsunamis are long-wavelength sea waves typically generated by underwater earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, or landslides. They can travel across entire ocean basins at high speeds, posing significant threats to coastal communities. Traditional scientific models often treat large tsunamis as non-dispersive waves, meaning they maintain a stable shape during propagation. However, dispersion—where wave energy spreads out—can occur in various wave types, affecting their behavior. Satellites like SWOT, launched in 2022, use advanced radar to measure ocean surface topography, providing detailed data on water bodies. DART buoys are part of a global network that detects tsunamis in deep water, aiding in early warning systems. Understanding tsunami dynamics is crucial for accurate forecasting and mitigating disaster risks."
