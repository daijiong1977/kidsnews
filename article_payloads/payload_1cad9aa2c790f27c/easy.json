  "title": "A Satellite Sees a Giant Tsunami in a New Way",
  "summary": "A NASA satellite called SWOT was flying over the Pacific Ocean when a big earthquake happened near Russia. The earthquake made a giant tsunami, which is a huge wave in the ocean. The satellite took pictures of the tsunami as it moved across the water. Scientists were surprised because they saw the tsunami was not just one simple wave. Instead, it had many smaller waves that spread out and mixed together. This is different from what scientists thought before. They used the satellite data along with information from buoys in the ocean to learn more. The satellite helps scientists see tsunamis better, like putting on new glasses. This can help people understand how tsunamis travel and how they might affect coasts, making it safer for everyone.",

    "Tsunamis are large ocean waves usually caused by underwater earthquakes or volcanic eruptions. They can travel across entire oceans and cause damage when they hit land. Scientists use tools like satellites and buoys to monitor tsunamis and warn people to stay safe. Satellites like SWOT take pictures from space to help us learn more about Earth's water, including how waves move."
