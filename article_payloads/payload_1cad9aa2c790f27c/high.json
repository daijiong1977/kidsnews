  "title": "SWOT Satellite Data Challenges Conventional Tsunami Dynamics",
  "summary": "A recent study published in The Seismic Record details how the Surface Water Ocean Topography (SWOT) satellite serendipitously recorded a major tsunami generated by a magnitude 8.8 earthquake in the Kuril-Kamchatka subduction zone. This event provided the first high-resolution space-based track of a subduction zone tsunami, revealing an intricate pattern of wave dispersion contrary to the traditional non-dispersive model. Researchers, including Angel Ruiz-Angulo, integrated SWOT's wide-swath data with Deep-ocean Assessment and Reporting of Tsunamis (DART) buoy measurements to refine seismic estimates and analyze wave behavior. The findings indicate that large tsunamis exhibit dispersive characteristics, where waves interact and scatter, potentially modulating the main wave's impact on coastlines. This challenges established scientific paradigms and suggests that current tsunami models may lack critical dispersive energy components. SWOT, a joint NASA-CNES mission launched in 2022 primarily for global water surveys, unexpectedly contributed to disaster science, offering unprecedented spatial resolution. The implications extend to improved numerical simulations and risk assessments, emphasizing the need for revised methodologies in tsunami forecasting to account for complex wave dynamics and enhance coastal resilience.",

    "Tsunamis are complex geophysical phenomena resulting from the displacement of large water volumes, often due to megathrust earthquakes in subduction zones. Traditional hydrodynamic models treat tsunamis as shallow-water waves, assuming non-dispersive behavior where wave speed depends solely on water depth, leading to simplified propagation predictions. However, dispersion effects, influenced by wavelength and ocean bathymetry, can cause wave separation and interaction, challenging these assumptions. The SWOT satellite employs Ka-band radar interferometry to achieve centimeter-scale accuracy in measuring ocean surface height, representing a technological advancement in remote sensing. DART systems provide in-situ data critical for calibrating satellite observations and refining tsunami source parameters. This interdisciplinary study bridges satellite oceanography, seismology, and computational modeling, highlighting the iterative nature of scientific progress where empirical data can overturn established theories and inform risk mitigation strategies in vulnerable coastal regions."
