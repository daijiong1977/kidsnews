  "title": "Bake Off Finalist Reflects on Challenges and Public Perception",
  "summary": "Aaron Mountford-Myles, a runner-up in the 16th series of The Great British Bake Off, discussed his experience on the popular Channel 4 show in an interview with BBC Radio Stoke. He revealed that despite his success as a baker, he actually hates making cakes, a surprising admission given his role. Mountford-Myles described the show as a mix of emotions, with significant stress from recipe writing and preparation, but emphasized that the highs outweighed the challenges. Since the series aired, he has noticed increased public attention, with more people requesting cakes from him, though his daily life remains largely unchanged as he continues his studies in analytics. He applied multiple times over eight years before succeeding, inspired by a colleague's praise for his homemade tarts. The experience taught him to handle criticism better, learning from judges Paul Hollywood and Prue Leith, and he encourages others to apply but warns that it requires serious effort and is not merely a fun activity.",
