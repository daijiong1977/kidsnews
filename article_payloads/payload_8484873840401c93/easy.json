  "title": "When the Oceans Died and Life Changed Forever",
  "summary": "Long ago, about 445 million years back, Earth had a big change. Ice spread across a big land called Gondwana, and shallow seas dried up. This made the oceans different and caused a huge problem: 85% of sea animals died. But from this sad event, something good happened. A new study shows that jawed fish, which have jaws, became more common and diverse after this. Scientists looked at old fossils to learn this. They found that during the hard times, jawed fish survived better in safe places called refugia. This helped them grow and change life on Earth later. The event is called the Late Ordovician Mass Extinction, and it shows how big changes can lead to new life.",

    "This article talks about a time long ago when Earth was very different. There were no people, and animals lived in the sea. A big change happened because ice spread and seas dried up, causing many animals to die. But some animals, like jawed fish, survived in safe spots and later became more diverse. Scientists study old bones called fossils to understand this. It shows how life can change after hard times, helping us learn about evolution and how animals adapt."
