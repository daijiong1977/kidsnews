  "title": "Iran's Protests and Internet Shutdown",
  "summary": "In Iran, many people are protesting, and the government has turned off the internet for over a week, so most of the 90 million people there cannot talk to the outside world. Human rights groups say more than 3,000 people have died because the government is cracking down hard on protesters. A top Iranian religious leader wants to execute prisoners. But President Trump thanked Iran for not executing hundreds of political prisoners. Reza Pahlavi, who used to be a prince of Iran and now lives outside the country, asked the United States to help by doing a military strike on specific targets in Iran to stop the violence. The article talks about how the U.S. promised help but hasn't done much, while Iran's government is being very harsh.",
