  "title": "Water Companies Get New Checks to Keep Water Clean",
  "summary": "The government in England and Wales is making big changes to help water companies do a better job. They will have surprise inspections, like MOT checks for cars, to make sure they are not polluting or wasting water. Water companies will also need to put labels on appliances like dishwashers to show how much water they use, so families can save water and money. This is because many people have been upset about dirty water, leaks, and water shortages. The government says water companies have been checking their own work, which is not fair, so now there will be new teams to watch them closely. A new boss called a chief engineer will help make sure everything runs smoothly. Some people think these changes are good but not enough to fix all the problems quickly.",

    "Water is essential for life, and in England and Wales, private companies are responsible for providing clean water to homes. Recently, there have been problems like water pollution from sewage, leaks in pipes causing waste, and outages where people have no water. This has made many customers angry. The government is stepping in to improve things by introducing stricter checks and new rules, similar to how cars get MOT tests to ensure they are safe. These changes aim to hold water companies accountable and protect the environment and public health."
