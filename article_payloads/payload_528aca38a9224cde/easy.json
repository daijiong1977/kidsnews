  "title": "Cannabis Drinks Help People Drink Less Alcohol",
  "summary": "A new study shows that people who drink cannabis beverages might cut their alcohol use almost in half. Researchers from the University at Buffalo looked at how cannabis drinks could help reduce harm from alcohol. Alcohol can cause many health problems like cancer, but cannabis is often less risky. The study asked 438 adults who used cannabis about their habits. About one-third of them tried cannabis drinks. Those who drank cannabis beverages were more likely to use them instead of alcohol. On average, they went from drinking about 7 alcoholic drinks per week to just over 3 drinks per week after starting cannabis drinks. Many people said they reduced or stopped drinking alcohol after trying cannabis drinks. This is the first study to explore cannabis drinks as a way to help people drink less alcohol, but more research is needed to see if this becomes a common practice.",

    "This article talks about a study on cannabis drinks and alcohol. Alcohol can be bad for health, causing diseases like cancer. Cannabis drinks are made from a plant and might be safer. Researchers wanted to see if drinking cannabis beverages could help people use less alcohol. They asked adults about their habits and found that many who tried cannabis drinks drank less alcohol. This is a new idea to help people stay healthier, but it's still being studied to see if it works for everyone."
