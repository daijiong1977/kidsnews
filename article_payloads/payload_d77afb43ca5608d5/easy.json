  "title": "How Warming Up Makes You Faster and Stronger",
  "summary": "Warming up before exercise is very important because it helps your muscles work better. Scientists from Edith Cowan University found that when your muscles get warmer, you can move faster and with more power. For every 1 degree Celsius increase in temperature, performance gets better by about 3.5%. There are two ways to warm up: passive, like using a heat pad, and active, like riding a bike. Both ways help, but doing warm-ups that are similar to your main exercise, like lifting lighter weights before heavy ones, can make you perform even better. Experts say you should start moving gently until you feel warm and sweaty, then you're ready for your workout. This trick can help anyone, from kids playing sports to adults at the gym.",

    "Warming up is a simple activity people do before sports or exercise to prepare their bodies. It involves light movements that increase muscle temperature, making it easier to move and reducing the risk of injuries. Scientists study how different warm-ups affect performance, and this article shares new findings that can help everyone from athletes to kids playing outside. Understanding this can make exercise safer and more fun."
