  "title": "How Clothes Tell Stories on a TV Show",
  "summary": "On a TV show called The Traitors, what people wear is very important. Contestants use their outfits to show who they are and to trick others. For example, one person wore a red dress after a big moment, which made others think she might be a traitor. Another contestant named Stephen wore colorful clothes like knitwear and jumpsuits to look friendly and confident, so people wouldn't suspect him. Experts say fashion helps shape how players see each other, and it makes the show more fun to watch. Clothes can tell a story without words, and in this game, they help contestants play their roles better.",
