  "summary": "In the reality TV series The Traitors, fashion plays a crucial role in shaping perceptions and strategies among contestants. The article highlights how clothing choices are not merely about style but serve as tactical tools to influence fellow players.

Experts such as Carolyn Mair, a stylist and author, explain that outfits can define a contestant's character and enhance the show's appeal, making fashion an integral part of the viewing experience. The recent series featured notable looks, from Claudia Winkleman's gothic style to contestants' viral outfits, emphasizing how fashion contributes to the drama and engagement of the show. Overall, the article explores the psychological impact of wardrobe decisions in a competitive setting, where appearance can be as influential as actions.",
