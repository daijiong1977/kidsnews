  "summary": "Aryna Sabalenka, the world number one tennis player, has advanced to the Australian Open women's singles final for the fourth consecutive year by defeating Elina Svitolina in the semi-finals with a commanding 6-2 6-3 victory. This achievement marks her as the first player since Martina Hingis in 2002 to reach four straight finals at this Grand Slam event. Sabalenka demonstrated dominant play, recording 29 winners to only 15 unforced errors and losing just 11 points on serve, showcasing her powerful hitting and improved mental focus. Despite facing challenges such as a hindrance call during the match, she maintained composure. Sabalenka is currently on an 11-match winning streak and has not dropped a set in this year's tournament. She aims to secure her third Australian Open title and fifth Grand Slam overall in the upcoming final against either Elena Rybakina or Jessica Pegula, seeking redemption after last year's final loss where she felt she lacked bravery.",
