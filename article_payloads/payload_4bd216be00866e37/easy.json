  "title": "Jobs Report Shows Changes in U.S. Job Market",
  "summary": "A new report about jobs in the U.S. shows that the job market is cooling down, which means it is getting slower. The unemployment rate went up to 4.6%, the highest in four years. This means more people are looking for work but cannot find jobs. However, there was some good news: 64,000 new jobs were added last month, which is better than expected. The report was delayed because the government had a shutdown for six weeks, so data collection was paused. An expert named David Wessel from the Brookings Institution says this shows the labor market is weakening, but there is uncertainty due to the shutdown affecting the data. The report also noted job losses in October and at the federal level recently.",

    "The U.S. job market is like a big puzzle where people work to earn money. Sometimes, it changes: when more people have jobs, it is strong; when fewer people have jobs, it is weak. The government collects data by asking people if they are working, and this helps make reports. A government shutdown happens when leaders cannot agree on spending, so some services stop. Experts like David Wessel study these reports to understand if the economy is doing well or needs help."
