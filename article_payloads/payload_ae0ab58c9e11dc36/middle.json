  "title": "Surviving a Shark Attack: A Story of Courage and Recovery",
  "summary": "Peter Smith, a 66-year-old retired IT director from Hertfordshire, was enjoying the last day of his holiday in Tobago when he decided to swim in the sea. Unaware of any shark risks—as attacks are unheard of on the island—he was suddenly bitten by a bull shark, one of the most dangerous species known for hunting in shallow waters. The shark, estimated at 10 feet long, attacked his leg, arm, and stomach, causing severe injuries and significant blood loss. In a moment of quick thinking, Peter fought back by punching the shark repeatedly, later describing it as the hardest he had ever hit anything. His friends, John and Moira, assisted in the struggle and helped drag him to shore, while his wife Joanna witnessed the traumatic scene. Peter was rushed to the only hospital on Tobago with deep lacerations and lost consciousness from pain and blood loss. Despite the terrifying ordeal, Peter shares in his interview that he is not scared of sharks, highlighting the rarity of such events and his personal resilience. This account provides insight into human survival instincts and the unexpected dangers of nature.",

    "Shark attacks are rare events globally, with species like bull sharks being particularly aggressive due to their habitat in shallow coastal waters. Tobago, a Caribbean island, is not known for shark attacks, making this incident unusual. Understanding shark behavior can help in assessing risks; bull sharks are opportunistic feeders and may mistake humans for prey. In emergencies, quick response from bystanders, as seen with Peter's friends, is crucial for survival. Medical treatment for severe injuries involves addressing blood loss and infections. This story connects to broader themes of human-nature interactions and psychological resilience after trauma, relevant for middle school students learning about biology and personal health."
