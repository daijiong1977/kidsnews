  "title": "A Man Fights a Shark to Save Himself",
  "summary": "Peter Smith was on holiday in Tobago with his wife and friends. He went for a swim in the sea, and suddenly a big shark bit his leg. The shark was a bull shark, which is very dangerous. Peter punched the shark hard to fight back, and it also bit his arm and stomach. He lost a lot of blood. His friends helped him get out of the water, and his wife saw his bad injuries. Peter was taken to the hospital, and he felt a lot of pain. Even though this happened, Peter is not scared of sharks anymore. The attack was rare because sharks don't usually attack people in Tobago. This story shows how brave Peter was during a scary time.",

    "Sharks are large fish that live in oceans around the world. Some sharks, like bull sharks, can be dangerous to people, but shark attacks are very rare. People often swim in the sea without problems. When someone is attacked, it's important to get help quickly from friends or doctors. Hospitals are places where injured people receive medical care to heal. This story helps us learn about bravery and safety in the water."
