  "title": "A Big Hole in a Canal Causes Trouble",
  "summary": "A large hole, called a sinkhole, has opened up in a canal in Shitchurch, Shropshire. This has caused a major incident, with two narrowboats falling into the hole and two more stuck at the edge. Police and fire services are helping people stay safe and asking others to avoid the area. No one is hurt. The Canal and River Trust is checking what happened and trying to fix the water levels. A local councillor said it happened early in the morning, and people thought it was an earthquake. Water has flooded into a nearby field, but a flood gate is stopping more water from escaping. Everyone is working to make the area safe again.",

    "Canals are artificial waterways built for transportation and leisure. Sinkholes can occur when the ground collapses, often due to water erosion or other natural causes. Emergency services like police and fire departments respond to major incidents to protect people and property. In this case, a sinkhole in a canal caused boats to sink and water to flood, leading to a coordinated safety effort."
