  "title": "Sinkhole Incident at Shropshire Canal Declared Major Emergency",
  "summary": "A major incident has been declared in Shitchurch, Shropshire, after a suspected sinkhole caused a breach in a canal, leading to significant structural damage. Two narrowboats sank into the cavity, while two others are precariously positioned at the edge. Emergency services, including Shropshire Fire and Rescue Service and West Mercia Police, are on site, with no casualties reported. The Canal and River Trust is investigating the cause and working to restore water levels. Local councillor Andy Hall described the event, which occurred around 05:00 GMT, noting that water flooded into a nearby field, and a flood gate has been installed to prevent further drainage. Authorities have urged the public to avoid the area, and support is being provided to affected boaters. The incident has raised flooding concerns, but efforts are focused on safety and containment.",
