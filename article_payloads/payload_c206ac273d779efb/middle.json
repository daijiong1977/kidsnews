  "title": "Katie Boulter's Australian Open Exit and Career Challenges",
  "summary": "Katie Boulter, the British tennis player, was eliminated in the first round of the Australian Open by Swiss 10th seed Belinda Bencic. The match ended in straight sets with scores of 6-0, 7-5. Boulter struggled initially, losing the first set in just 26 minutes without winning a game, but showed resilience in the second set by breaking Bencic's serve to level at 4-4 before ultimately losing. This loss comes after a challenging 2025 season where Boulter dropped from world number 24 to outside the top 100 due to injuries and inconsistent performance, losing her British number one ranking to Emma Raducanu. To rebuild her career, Boulter has ended her partnership with long-term coach Biljana Veselinovic and is now working with Michael Joyce, a coach known for helping Maria Sharapova achieve success. Additionally, Boulter is looking forward to personal milestones, including her wedding to Australian tennis star Alex de Minaur planned for 2026. She expressed optimism about playing lower-level tournaments on the WTA Tour to regain form and rhythm. The article highlights her efforts to balance professional setbacks with personal happiness and a fresh start in tennis.",
