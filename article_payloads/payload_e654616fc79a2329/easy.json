  "title": "A Big Discovery Under the Sea Near Greece",
  "summary": "Scientists have found a huge area of hot water vents on the seafloor near the Greek island of Milos. They used special tools like underwater cameras and robots to explore the ocean. The vents are in three main spots along cracks in the Earth called faults. These faults are part of a big geological structure that makes the seafloor sink. The vents release hot fluids and gases, creating beautiful sights like shimmering water and thick mats of tiny living things. This discovery helps scientists learn how Earth's movements shape the ocean floor. The team was surprised by how big and pretty the vents are. They plan to study more areas like a volcano near Santorini. This work was done by scientists from Greece and Germany working together.",

    "Hydrothermal vents are like underwater geysers where hot water shoots out from the seafloor. They are often found in places where Earth's tectonic plates move, creating cracks. These vents can support unique life forms, like bacteria and worms, that don't need sunlight. Scientists study vents to understand how life might exist in extreme places and how Earth's geology works. The Mediterranean Sea is a special area for such discoveries because it has active volcanoes and faults. Learning about vents helps us know more about our planet's hidden parts."
