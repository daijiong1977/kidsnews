  "title": "Banksy's New Art in London",
  "summary": "A famous secret artist named Banksy made two new paintings in London. The paintings show two children lying on the ground in winter clothes, pointing up at the sky. One painting is in Bayswater, and another identical one is near Centre Point tower. Banksy shared a picture on Instagram to tell people about his art. Some people think the paintings are about children who are homeless, especially at Christmas time. The Centre Point tower used to be empty for many years, which made people upset because it could have been used for homes. Now it has expensive apartments. Banksy did not say why he chose these places for his art.",

    "Banksy is a well-known street artist from England who paints on walls in public places. His real name is a secret, which makes his art exciting and mysterious. He often uses his paintings to talk about important issues like helping people who are poor or homeless. In London, there are many buildings and streets where artists like Banksy create art to share messages with everyone. Christmas is a time when people celebrate, but it can also be hard for those without homes, so artists might make art to remind us to care."
