  "title": "Analyzing Beam Misalignment as a Critical Vulnerability in Quantum Key Distribution Systems",
  "summary": "Quantum key distribution (QKD) represents a paradigm shift in cryptographic security, utilizing quantum mechanical principles to facilitate unconditionally secure communication through the generation of shared secret keys. Its robustness is theoretically guaranteed by the no-cloning theorem and the detection of eavesdropping via signal disturbance. However, practical implementations are susceptible to pointing error, a form of beam misalignment arising from mechanical vibrations, atmospheric turbulence, or alignment system imperfections, which can significantly degrade performance. This study, published in IEEE Journal of Quantum Electronics, introduces a comprehensive analytical framework to quantify the impact of pointing error on QKD optical wireless communication (OWC) systems. Researchers employed the BB84 protocol and advanced statistical models, including Rayleigh and Hoyt distributions, to realistically characterize horizontal and vertical beam variations. By integrating these with quantum photon detection theory, they derived analytical expressions for error and sift probabilities, enabling the calculation of the quantum bit error rate (QBER)—a critical metric for assessing system reliability under noise and potential interception. Subsequently, the secret key rate (SKR) was determined to evaluate secure key generation efficiency. Findings reveal that increased beam waist exacerbates pointing error, leading to elevated QBER and diminished SKR, thereby compromising cryptographic integrity. While expanding the receiver aperture offers limited mitigation, asymmetric beam misalignment occasionally yields superior performance compared to symmetric conditions. The study concludes that maintaining a non-zero SKR necessitates augmenting the average photon transmission, highlighting a trade-off between security and practical constraints. This research underscores the importance of addressing alignment vulnerabilities to advance QKD toward real-world applicability.",
