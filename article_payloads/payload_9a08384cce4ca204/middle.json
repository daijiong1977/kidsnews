  "title": "The Impact of Beam Misalignment on Quantum Encryption Security",
  "summary": "Quantum key distribution (QKD) is an advanced encryption technique that leverages quantum mechanics to enable secure communication between two parties, even in the presence of eavesdroppers. Its security stems from the principle that any interception attempt disrupts quantum signals, producing detectable errors. However, a significant challenge is pointing error, which occurs when the transmitter and receiver are misaligned due to factors like mechanical vibrations or atmospheric turbulence. This misalignment can degrade system performance by interfering with signal exchange. Researchers addressed this issue by developing an analytical model published in IEEE Journal of Quantum Electronics. They focused on the BB84 QKD protocol and used statistical distributions, such as Rayleigh and Hoyt, to realistically model beam misalignment. This allowed them to derive expressions for error probabilities and calculate the quantum bit error rate (QBER), a key metric reflecting system reliability. From QBER, they determined the secret key rate (SKR), which measures how quickly secure keys can be generated. Their findings indicate that increased beam waist leads to higher pointing error, resulting in elevated QBER and reduced SKR, thus compromising performance. Expanding the receiver aperture can mitigate this, but only to a limit. Interestingly, asymmetric misalignment sometimes outperforms symmetric cases. To maintain secure communication, increasing photon transmission may be necessary. This study provides insights into optimizing QKD systems by addressing alignment flaws.",
