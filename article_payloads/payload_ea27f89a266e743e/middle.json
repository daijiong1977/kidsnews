  "title": "Spin Size Flips the Kondo Effect: A Quantum Breakthrough",
  "summary": "In condensed matter physics, the Kondo effect is a key collective phenomenon where localized quantum spins interact with mobile electrons, influencing material behavior. Studying it is challenging due to complexities like electron motion and orbital effects. To simplify, physicists use models like the Kondo necklace, introduced in 1977, which focuses only on spin interactions. A critical question has been whether spin size affects the Kondo effect. Researchers from Osaka Metropolitan University addressed this by engineering organic-inorganic hybrid materials using the RaX-D framework. They created Kondo necklaces with spin-1/2 and spin-1 localized spins. Thermodynamic measurements showed a phase transition for spin-1, leading to magnetic order. Quantum analysis revealed that Kondo coupling creates effective magnetic interactions for spin-1, stabilizing long-range order. This overturns the traditional view that the Kondo effect suppresses magnetism; instead, for spins larger than 1/2, it promotes magnetic order. The study provides direct experimental evidence that spin size fundamentally changes the Kondo effect's role, offering insights into quantum materials.",
