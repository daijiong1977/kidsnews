  "title": "A Doctor's New Way to Help People Lose Weight",
  "summary": "Dr. Leigh Perreault is an endocrinologist who helps people with weight problems. She felt sad that many patients were told to eat better and exercise more, but that didn't always work. She wanted to help them lose weight to improve their health. So, she created a program called PATHWEIGH. This program helps doctors and patients focus on weight management during special clinic visits. It was tested in many clinics in Colorado with over 274,000 patients. The results showed that people gained less weight and some even lost weight. This program made it more likely for patients to get help for weight issues. Now, other doctors are interested in using PATHWEIGH too.",
