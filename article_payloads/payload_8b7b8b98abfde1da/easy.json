  "title": "Finding Ancient Genes from Before All Life",
  "summary": "Scientists have discovered special genes called universal paralogs that existed before all life on Earth. Every living thing today comes from a single ancestor that lived billions of years ago, called the last universal common ancestor. These universal paralogs are genes that appear in almost all organisms, like in humans and plants. They were copied from older genes before the first common ancestor existed. Researchers studied these genes to learn about early life. They found that these ancient genes helped with making proteins and moving things in and out of cells. This tells us that protein production and membrane transport were some of the first jobs cells had. Scientists use computers and AI to study these genes more easily. By looking at universal paralogs, we can understand how life started and evolved long ago.",

Universal paralogs are special genes that existed before this ancestor and are found in almost all organisms today. They help with basic cell functions like making proteins and moving molecules. Researchers use technology like AI to analyze these genes and uncover clues about how life evolved from simple beginnings."
