  "title": "Uncovering Pre-Life Genes: A Study of Universal Paralogs",
  "summary": "In a recent study published in Cell Genomics, scientists Aaron Goldman, Greg Fournier, and Betül Kaçar investigated universal paralogs, a rare group of genes that existed before the last universal common ancestor (LUCA), the earliest organism from which all life today descends. Universal paralogs are gene families that appear in at least two copies in nearly all living organisms, indicating they duplicated before LUCA emerged around four billion years ago. The researchers analyzed these genes to gain insights into life's earliest evolutionary events. They found that every known universal paralog is involved in protein production or molecule transport across cell membranes, suggesting these functions were among the first to evolve. Using AI-based techniques and computational tools, the team reconstructed ancient forms of these genes, such as one involved in embedding proteins into membranes, revealing how primitive cells might have operated. This approach offers a new window into pre-LUCA biology, connecting modern science to life's origins. The authors emphasize that universal paralogs, though few, provide critical evidence about cellular lineages before LUCA, helping transform unknowns in evolution into testable hypotheses.",

    "Life on Earth originated from a last universal common ancestor (LUCA) about four billion years ago, with cells already having membranes and DNA. To understand events before LUCA, scientists study universal paralogs—genes duplicated prior to LUCA that persist in nearly all organisms. These genes offer clues to early cellular functions, such as protein synthesis and membrane transport. Advances in AI and computational biology enable detailed analysis of these ancient genetic patterns, helping reconstruct primitive cellular mechanisms. This research bridges evolutionary biology and modern technology, shedding light on life's deepest origins and the evolutionary processes that shaped all living things."
