  "title": "A Famous Writer's Baby Boy: A Sad Story in Nigeria",
  "summary": "This article is about a sad event in Nigeria. A famous writer named Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie lost her baby boy, Nkanu, who was only 21 months old. He died in a hospital called Euracare in Lagos, Nigeria. The family says the hospital did not take good care of him, like not giving enough oxygen and giving too much medicine, which made his heart stop. The hospital says they are sorry but did nothing wrong. Now, a court will have an inquest, which is like a special investigation, to find out what really happened. The inquest will start on April 14, and people will give evidence to help the court understand. Adichie is a well-known author from Nigeria who lives in the US, and this was one of her twin boys born with help from a surrogate. The story shows how families and hospitals sometimes disagree about medical care.",

    "This story is about a family's loss and a legal process in Nigeria. Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie is a famous Nigerian writer known for books like 'Half of a Yellow Sun'. She had twin boys in 2024 with help from a surrogate, and one of them, Nkanu, died after medical procedures. An inquest is a court investigation to determine the cause of death, often used when there are questions about medical care. Hospitals have a duty to provide safe treatment, and families can seek justice if they believe mistakes were made. This helps explain why courts get involved in such sad events."
