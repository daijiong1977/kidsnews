  "title": "Budget Fashion Stores Change Shopping in Small Towns",
  "summary": "In small towns in India, new budget fashion stores like Trends and Zudio are becoming very popular. These stores sell clothes, shoes, and accessories at low prices, similar to street markets, but offer a better shopping experience with air conditioning, trial rooms, and helpful staff. People like Alka, who used to shop only in bazaars, now enjoy buying trendy and branded clothes here. This change is helping these stores grow fast, with Zudio expanding from 7 to 765 stores and earning over $1 billion. It shows how more people in small towns want affordable yet stylish fashion.",
