  "title": "Water Quality Gets a Little Better at Swimming Spots",
  "summary": "New numbers show that the water quality at swimming places in England has improved a bit. Out of 449 spots tested, 93% now meet the basic standards for clean water, which is better than last year. This means fewer places have poor water quality, down from 37 to 32. The water is checked for germs that can come from sewage, farms, and other pollution. The government and groups like the Environment Agency are working to make water cleaner so people can swim safely. They say more needs to be done, but it's getting better. This is important because clean water helps keep everyone healthy when they go for a swim.",

    "Water quality refers to how clean and safe water is for activities like swimming. In England, the Environment Agency tests water at beaches, rivers, and lakes for bacteria that can come from pollution, such as sewage from toilets or waste from farms. Meeting standards means the water is safe enough for people to swim without getting sick. Over time, efforts by the government and companies have helped improve water quality, but pollution is still a problem that needs more work to protect health and the environment."
