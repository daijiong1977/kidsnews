  "title": "A Sleeping Star Wakes Up and Shines Bright",
  "summary": "Scientists watched a special star called a neutron star wake up and become very bright. This star is in a galaxy far away, about 10 million light-years from Earth. When gas falls onto the star because of its strong gravity, it makes X-rays, which are a type of light we can't see with our eyes. The star was sleeping and not very bright for a while, but then it started to shine again in 2022 and got much brighter by 2024. The star spins very fast, and scientists found that when it got brighter, it also spun faster. This helps them understand how gas falls onto stars and makes them light up. They used telescopes in space to watch this happen over many years.",
