  "title": "President Trump Wants to Help Fix Venezuela's Oil",
  "summary": "President Trump wants American companies to go to Venezuela and fix its oil industry. Venezuela has a lot of oil, but it is not producing much because of problems inside the country and U.S. rules called sanctions. Only one American company, Chevron, is allowed to work there right now. The president says the U.S. government could pay some money to help the companies rebuild the oil equipment. He hopes this will let more companies invest and make money. Venezuela took control of its oil from other countries many years ago, which makes it hard for outsiders to help now. A professor named Francisco Monaldi explains these issues in the article.",

    "Venezuela is a country in South America with a lot of oil, which is valuable for making energy. In the past, Venezuela let companies from other countries help with its oil, but then the government took control. This means the government owns the oil industry now. The U.S. has rules called sanctions that limit trade with Venezuela because of political disagreements. Oil infrastructure includes things like wells and pipelines that need fixing to produce more oil. Investing means putting money into projects to earn profits."
