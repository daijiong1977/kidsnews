  "title": "Satellite Mistake Hides Arctic Snow Loss",
  "summary": "Scientists found a big mistake in how we measure snow in the Arctic. For a long time, data from satellites showed that snow cover was growing, but new research says it's actually shrinking. Snow is important because it reflects sunlight and helps keep the Earth cool. When snow melts, the dark ground absorbs more heat, making the Arctic warm up faster. The problem was that satellites got better at seeing thin snow over time, so it looked like there was more snow, but it was just the technology improving. A student named Aleksandra led the study to fix this error. This helps us understand climate change better and why the Arctic is heating up so quickly.",

    "Climate change is when Earth's weather gets warmer over time, often because of human activities. The Arctic is a very cold region at the top of the world, covered in ice and snow. Snow helps cool the planet by reflecting sunlight. Scientists use satellites to watch changes on Earth from space. Sometimes, technology improvements can make data look different, so it's important to check old information carefully."
