  "title": "Food Preservatives and Diabetes Risk for Kids",
  "summary": "A big study found that eating foods with preservatives might make people more likely to get type 2 diabetes. Preservatives are chemicals added to processed foods like snacks and drinks to keep them fresh longer. Scientists from France looked at over 100,000 adults for many years. They tracked what people ate and their health. The study showed that those who ate more preservatives had a higher risk of diabetes. Preservatives are common in many foods, and they are listed on labels with codes like E200 to E399. This research helps us understand how food additives can affect our health, so it's important to eat fresh foods when possible.",

    "Type 2 diabetes is a health condition where the body doesn't use insulin well, leading to high blood sugar. It can cause problems like tiredness and heart disease. Preservatives are common in many packaged foods we eat every day, such as crackers, canned soups, and soft drinks. This study from France shows that eating too many of these foods might increase the chance of getting diabetes. It's important for kids to learn about healthy eating by choosing more fresh fruits, vegetables, and whole grains instead of processed snacks."
