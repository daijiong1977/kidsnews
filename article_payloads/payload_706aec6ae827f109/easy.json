  "title": "Leaders Talk About Peace in Ukraine",
  "summary": "Donald Trump and Volodymyr Zelensky met in Florida to talk about ending the war in Ukraine. They said they made some progress, especially on security guarantees for Ukraine, which means the US might help protect Ukraine for 15 years. But they still have big problems to solve, like what will happen to the Donbas region. Russia wants to control all of Donbas, but Ukraine wants to keep some control. Both leaders think they are close to a peace deal, but they need to work more on the hard parts. They hope to stop the fighting soon.",
