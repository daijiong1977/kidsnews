  "title": "Princess Catherine Helps People with Addiction",
  "summary": "Princess Catherine, who is part of the royal family, wants everyone to stop being mean to people with addiction. Addiction is when someone can't stop using drugs, alcohol, or gambling, and it's not their fault. She says we should be kind and help them instead of making them feel ashamed. Catherine is working with a charity called The Forward Trust to support people during Addiction Awareness Week. She explains that addiction is like a mental health problem and needs care. Many families are affected by addiction, so she urges people to talk openly and listen to those who need help. By showing love and compassion, we can help them recover and have better lives.",

    "Addiction is a condition where someone finds it hard to stop doing something that harms them, like drinking too much alcohol or using drugs. It can affect anyone and often makes people feel alone and ashamed. Mental health is about our emotions and thoughts, and addiction is linked to it because it can be caused by stress or other feelings. Charities like The Forward Trust provide support and advice to help people recover. By learning about addiction, we can be kinder and help those in need feel accepted and supported in their communities."
