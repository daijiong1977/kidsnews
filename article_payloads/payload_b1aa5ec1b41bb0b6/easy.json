  "title": "Surprising Ocean Carbon Fixers",
  "summary": "Scientists have discovered something new about how the ocean stores carbon, which helps keep our planet cooler. The ocean absorbs carbon dioxide from the air, and tiny living things called microbes help fix this carbon in deep, dark waters where there is no sunlight. Researchers from UC Santa Barbara found that old ideas about these microbes using nitrogen for energy didn't match the carbon fixation they measured. They did experiments by stopping some microbes with a special chemical to see what happens. This helps solve a mystery about how carbon moves in the ocean and why it's important for Earth's climate. The study was published in a science journal and supported by the National Science Foundation.",

    "The ocean is like a big sponge that soaks up carbon dioxide from the air, which helps slow down global warming. Tiny microbes in the ocean help store this carbon, especially in deep parts where it's dark. Scientists have been trying to figure out how these microbes work because it affects how much carbon the ocean can hold. This study shows that old ideas might be wrong, and new experiments help us learn more."
