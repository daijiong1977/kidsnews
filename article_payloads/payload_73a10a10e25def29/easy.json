  "title": "A New Tiny Worm Found in a Very Salty Lake",
  "summary": "Scientists have found a new type of tiny worm in the Great Salt Lake, which is a very salty lake in the United States. This worm is so small you can barely see it, and it has never been seen before anywhere else in the world. The scientists named it Diplolaimelloides woaabi, using a word from the Indigenous Shoshone people that means 'worm.' Worms like this are called nematodes, and they are found all over Earth, but this is the first time one has been discovered in this lake. Before this, only two other animals, brine shrimp and brine flies, were known to live there. The scientists are excited because they think there might be another new worm in the lake too. They want to learn how the worms got there and what they do in the lake's environment.",

    "The Great Salt Lake is a large, salty lake in Utah, USA, known for its high salt content that makes it hard for most animals to live there. Nematodes are tiny worms found almost everywhere on Earth, from soil to deep oceans, but they are often overlooked because they are so small. Indigenous people, like the Shoshone, have lived near the lake for thousands of years and have deep connections to the land. Scientists study new species to learn how ecosystems work and protect them."
