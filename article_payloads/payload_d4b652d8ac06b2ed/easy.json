  "title": "Soldiers Take Over in Guinea-Bissau After Elections",
  "summary": "In Guinea-Bissau, a country in Africa, soldiers have taken control of the government. This happened just a few days after people voted in national elections. The soldiers appeared on TV and said they removed the president from power. They also closed the country's borders and stopped the election process. The president said he was arrested. There were gunshots heard near the presidential palace, and soldiers set up checkpoints. Guinea-Bissau has had many coups in the past, where the military takes over. The soldiers claimed they acted because some politicians and a drug lord were trying to change the election results. This event shows how unstable the country can be.",

    "Guinea-Bissau is a small country in West Africa that became independent in 1974. It has had many problems with the military taking over the government, called coups. Elections are when people vote for leaders, but sometimes they are not fair. Drug trafficking means illegal drugs are moved through the country, which can cause more trouble. This article talks about a recent coup where soldiers took control after elections."
