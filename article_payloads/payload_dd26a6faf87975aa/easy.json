  "title": "Nature Loss Can Hurt Our Safety and Food",
  "summary": "A new report says that when nature gets sick, it can make the UK less safe and prosperous. The report was made by a group that looks at security risks. It warns that if important places like rainforests and coral reefs collapse, it could cause problems like fights over resources, people moving to new places, and higher food prices. The UK gets a lot of food from other countries, so if those places have trouble, we might not have enough food or it could cost more. The report lists six key areas around the world that are very important for the UK's safety. The government says this report will help them plan for the future to keep people safe and healthy.",
