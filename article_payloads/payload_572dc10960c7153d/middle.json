  "title": "Drag Race UK Winner's Prize Money Plans",
  "summary": "Bones emerged as the winner of RuPaul's Drag Race UK series seven, securing a £25,000 cash prize after a intense lip-sync battle against Elle Vosque. In an interview with BBC Newsbeat, Bones expressed overwhelming happiness and described the win as the cherry on top of her journey. She revealed a pact with fellow finalist Elle from west Belfast to take each other on a holiday if either won, with potential destinations including Europe, the Caribbean, or a cruise. Originally from Stalybridge, Greater Manchester, Bones has been involved in drag for seven years and is now a prominent figure in London's Soho drag scene. She plans to use the prize money to enhance her drag performances, noting that drag is an expensive art form requiring significant investment in costumes and creativity. Additionally, Bones commented on the growing popularity and saturation of drag, emphasizing that queens must now proactively create opportunities for themselves. This marks the second year the UK edition has offered a cash prize since its 2019 launch, reflecting the show's evolving impact on the drag community.",
