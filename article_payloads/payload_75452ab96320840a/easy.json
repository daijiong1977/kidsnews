  "title": "How Sick Kidneys Can Hurt Your Heart",
  "summary": "Scientists found out why many people with kidney disease get heart problems. When kidneys are damaged, they send tiny particles into the blood. These particles travel to the heart and can make it sick too. This discovery helps doctors find patients at risk earlier so they can get treatment sooner. Kidney disease is common in the United States, especially in people with diabetes or high blood pressure. In tests with mice, stopping these particles helped the heart work better. Researchers hope to create a blood test to spot high-risk patients and new treatments to protect the heart. This could save lives by preventing heart failure in people with kidney issues.",

    "Kidneys are organs that filter waste from your blood. When they get sick, it can affect other parts of your body like the heart. Heart failure means the heart doesn't pump blood well. Scientists study how organs talk to each other to find ways to keep people healthy. This article talks about new research that shows how sick kidneys send harmful things to the heart, which could lead to better tests and treatments."
