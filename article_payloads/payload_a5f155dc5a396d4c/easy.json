  "title": "Plastic in Fish Far Away in the Pacific Ocean",
  "summary": "Scientists found tiny pieces of plastic, called microplastics, in fish living near islands in the Pacific Ocean. Even though these islands are very far from big cities, about one out of every three fish had microplastics inside them. The study looked at fish from Fiji, Tonga, Tuvalu, and Vanuatu. Fiji had the most plastic in its fish, with almost 75% of fish having microplastics. Fish that live near coral reefs or eat from the seafloor were more likely to have plastic. This is a problem because people on these islands eat a lot of fish for food. The scientists say we need better ways to manage waste to keep the ocean clean and protect the fish that people depend on.",

    "Microplastics are small plastic pieces that come from things like bottles or bags breaking down. They can end up in the ocean and be eaten by fish. In the Pacific Ocean, there are many islands where people rely on fish for food. Scientists studied fish from four islands to see if they had microplastics. They found that even in remote places, plastic pollution is a big issue. This matters because eating fish with plastic might not be healthy, and we need to keep our oceans clean for the future."
