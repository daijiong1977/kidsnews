  "title": "Libraries Stop Helping with Passports",
  "summary": "The U.S. State Department has told some public libraries to stop helping people with passport applications. These libraries have been doing this for many years, and people in their communities rely on this service. The State Department says that libraries, which are not part of the government, cannot collect fees for passports. This affects many libraries across the country, especially in states like Connecticut and Pennsylvania. Lawmakers are asking the government to let libraries continue until a new plan is made. Without this service, people might have to travel far or miss work to get a passport, which is harder for working families and rural residents. Some libraries might even have to cut jobs or close if they lose the money from passport fees.",
