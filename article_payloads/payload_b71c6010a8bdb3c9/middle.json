  "title": "State Department Halts Passport Services at Nonprofit Libraries",
  "summary": "The U.S. State Department has issued cease and desist orders to certain public libraries, requiring them to stop processing passport applications. This action disrupts a long-standing service that many communities depend on, with libraries like the Otis Library in Norwich, Connecticut, having offered it for 18 years. The State Department cites federal laws that prohibit non-governmental organizations from collecting and retaining passport application fees as the reason for the order, while government-run libraries remain unaffected. Although the agency claims that affected libraries make up less than one percent of the nationwide network, the American Library Association estimates that up to 1,400 nonprofit libraries could be impacted, representing about 15% of all public libraries. Lawmakers from multiple states are pushing back, arguing that libraries are crucial for accessibility, especially for working families and rural residents during a surge in passport demand due to Real ID requirements. They warn that without this service, people may face longer travel distances, unpaid time off work, and potential library closures due to lost revenue from processing fees. The issue highlights differences in how public libraries are organized across states, with many structured as nonprofit entities.",

    "Passports are essential documents for international travel and identity verification, managed by the U.S. State Department. The Passport Acceptance Facility program allows authorized locations, including many public libraries, to assist with applications by verifying documents and collecting fees. Public libraries vary in structure: some are government-run, while others are nonprofit organizations. This distinction is key in this article, as federal law restricts fee collection to governmental bodies. The Real ID Act has heightened demand for passports as alternative IDs, making library services more critical. Lawmakers are involved because they can influence policy changes, and the issue affects community accessibility and library funding."
