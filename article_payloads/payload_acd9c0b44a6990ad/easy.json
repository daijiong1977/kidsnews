  "title": "A Tiny Protein That Controls Hunger",
  "summary": "Scientists found a tiny protein called MRAP2 that helps control how hungry you feel. It works with another protein named MC3R to balance energy in your body. When MRAP2 is present, it makes MC3R stronger, so your body knows when to eat or use energy. If MRAP2 has changes from genes, it might not work well, which can lead to eating too much and obesity. This discovery helps us understand why some people gain weight easily and could lead to new medicines to help them feel full and stay healthy. The research was done by a team at the University of Birmingham using cells in a lab.",

    "Proteins are like tiny workers in your body that help it do things like grow, move, and feel hungry. Hunger is a signal from your body telling you to eat food for energy. Sometimes, if proteins don't work right, people might eat too much and become obese, which means they have extra body fat that can cause health problems. Scientists study proteins to understand how to keep people healthy and find ways to help those who struggle with weight."
