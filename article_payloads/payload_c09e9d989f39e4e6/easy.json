  "title": "Scientists Solve a Big Puzzle About Tiny Particles",
  "summary": "Scientists have figured out a mystery about tiny particles called quantum particles. They studied how one special particle acts when it is surrounded by many other particles. Sometimes, this particle moves around freely, and other times, it stays almost still. The scientists from Heidelberg University created a new idea to explain this. They say it helps us understand how particles work together in things like cold gases and materials. This could help with experiments in science. The study was published in a science journal.",
