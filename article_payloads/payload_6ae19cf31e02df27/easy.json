  "title": "Senate Talks About Homeland Security Money",
  "summary": "In Washington, D.C., Democrats and the White House are talking about how to fund the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) before the money runs out on Saturday. Democrats want new rules for immigration enforcement, like requiring warrants and stopping racial profiling, after two protesters were shot by federal agents in Minneapolis. They sent their ideas to the White House, which sent back a counterproposal. Senate leaders from both parties say they are making progress and hope to find agreement to avoid a government shutdown. The talks are happening because time is short, and both sides are trying to work together on this important issue.",

    "The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) is a big part of the U.S. government that helps keep the country safe from things like terrorism and natural disasters. It needs money from Congress to pay for its work, like border security and emergency response. Sometimes, politicians disagree on how to spend this money, which can lead to a government shutdown where some services stop. In this article, Democrats and the White House are trying to agree on funding and new rules for immigration, which is about how people move to and live in the U.S. This is important because it affects safety and fairness for everyone."
