  "title": "Balancing History and Fun in Total War Games",
  "summary": "Total War is a real-time strategy video game series developed by Creative Assembly, where players take on roles as historical leaders to manage resources and armies in conquest scenarios. Since its launch 25 years ago, it has sold over 35 million copies, with games set in diverse historical periods like ancient Rome, feudal Japan, and ancient Egypt. The developers prioritize historical accuracy, and they collaborate with experts such as Professor Peter Wilson, the Chichele Professor of the History of War at Oxford University. Wilson advises on the upcoming Total War: Medieval III, aiming to engage the public with historical warfare through interactive media. He was approached after a developer read his book, and he contributes insights, such as how seasons influenced medieval warfare. This partnership highlights the growing trend of using video games as educational tools to communicate complex historical topics beyond traditional formats like books and podcasts.",
