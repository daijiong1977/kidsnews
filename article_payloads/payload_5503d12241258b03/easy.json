  "title": "Video Games That Teach History",
  "summary": "Total War is a popular video game series where players act as historical leaders to manage armies and resources, aiming to conquer the world. It has sold over 35 million copies and features settings like ancient Rome and feudal Japan. The developers work hard to make the games accurate to history. Professor Peter Wilson, an expert on war from Oxford University, helps them by advising on a new game called Total War: Medieval III. He wants to share knowledge about past wars with people through games, not just books or TV. He got involved after a developer read his book, and he helps make the games more realistic, such as showing how seasons affected battles in medieval times.",
