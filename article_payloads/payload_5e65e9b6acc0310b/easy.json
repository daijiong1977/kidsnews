  "title": "Five Big Moments When Your Brain Changes",
  "summary": "Scientists found that our brains change in five big stages as we grow from babies to older adults. They studied brain scans from many people, from newborns to 90 years old. The first stage is from birth to about age nine, when the brain grows fast and learns a lot. Then comes adolescence, which lasts until around age 32, where the brain gets better at thinking and connecting. Next is adulthood, from the 30s to 60s, when the brain is stable. After that, early aging starts near age 66, and late aging begins around 83, which can involve memory changes. These stages help us understand why we learn, behave, and sometimes face challenges like learning problems or dementia at different ages.",

    "This article talks about how our brains change as we get older. Scientists from the University of Cambridge looked at brain scans from many people of different ages to see patterns. They found five main stages from babyhood to old age, with turning points at ages like 9, 32, 66, and 83. This helps explain why we learn and behave differently at various times and might help with problems like learning issues or memory loss in older people."
