  "title": "Trump's Proposal to Cap Credit Card Interest Rates Faces Industry Pushback",
  "summary": "President Donald Trump is advocating for a one-year cap on credit card interest rates at 10%, reviving a campaign pledge aimed at reducing financial burdens on Americans. This proposal could save consumers approximately $100 billion annually in interest, as current rates average between 19.65% and 21.5%. However, it has sparked strong opposition from banks and credit card companies, which have supported Trump's agenda and donated to his campaign. These industry groups argue that such a cap would harm low-income individuals by potentially reducing credit availability, forcing them toward high-cost alternatives like payday loans. Researchers indicate that while the credit card industry would remain profitable, rewards programs might be scaled back. The implementation method is unclear, with possibilities including executive action or legislation, and Trump aims for it to take effect by January 20. With about 195 million Americans holding credit cards and carrying record debt of $1.23 trillion, this issue highlights tensions between consumer protection and financial industry interests.",

Political proposals like caps aim to protect consumers but face industry resistance due to profit concerns. Understanding economic policies, interest mechanisms, and the balance between regulation and market freedom is key for middle school students learning about personal finance and government roles."
