  "title": "President Trump Wants to Lower Credit Card Interest Rates",
  "summary": "President Donald Trump wants to put a cap on credit card interest rates at 10% for one year. This means credit card companies could not charge more than 10% interest. He hopes this will save Americans money, as many people pay around 20% to 30% interest on their credit cards. Banks and credit card companies do not like this idea because they say it might hurt poor people by making it harder to get credit. They argue that if they cannot charge high interest, they might stop offering credit cards or reduce rewards. About 195 million Americans have credit cards and pay a lot in interest. Trump made this promise during his campaign and is now trying to make it happen, but it is not clear if he will use a law or an executive order. This could save people billions of dollars, but banks are pushing back.",

    "Credit cards let people buy things and pay later, but they charge interest, which is extra money. High interest rates mean people pay a lot more. President Trump wants to limit this to help save money. Banks worry this could make it harder for some people to get credit. Understanding interest and how credit works is important for managing money."
