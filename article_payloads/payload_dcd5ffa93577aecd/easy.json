  "title": "Ocean Blackouts: When the Sea Gets Too Dark",
  "summary": "Scientists have discovered something called marine darkwaves, which are times when the ocean floor suddenly gets very dark. This happens because things like dirt from land, too much algae, or other stuff in the water block sunlight. Marine darkwaves can last from a few days to over two months and make it hard for sea plants and animals that need light to live, such as kelp forests, seagrass, and corals. A team of scientists from around the world studied data from places like California and New Zealand to create a new way to measure and compare these dark events. They found that storms and big weather systems, like cyclones, often cause marine darkwaves. Even short dark times can hurt ocean life, so this new tool helps people understand when the ocean is in trouble, similar to how we track heatwaves or acidification.",

    "Marine darkwaves are like sudden blackouts in the ocean where sunlight can't reach the bottom. This is important because many sea creatures, such as kelp and seagrass, need light to make food through photosynthesis, just like plants on land. When it gets too dark, they can't grow or survive well. Scientists studied places like California and New Zealand to learn more about these events and help protect ocean life."
