  "title": "Post-Supreme Court Tariff Ruling: Legal, Economic, and Policy Implications for Consumers and the Economy",
  "summary": "In a landmark decision, the Supreme Court struck down approximately two-thirds of President Trump's global tariffs, which were enacted under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA), deeming them an overreach of executive authority. This ruling represents a significant judicial check on presidential power, but President Trump swiftly responded by announcing intentions to leverage alternative statutory frameworks, such as Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act and Section 122 of the Trade Act, to reinstate comparable tariff levels. Natasha Sarin, a professor of law and finance at Yale University, provides critical analysis, noting that these alternative authorities entail more rigorous procedural and substantive requirements, potentially limiting the administration's ability to impose tariffs as expansively as before. The tariffs, which targeted imports from both allied and adversarial nations at historically elevated rates, have profound implications for macroeconomic stability, consumer price inflation, and international trade relations. This article delves into the intricate interplay between legal jurisprudence and economic policy, assessing the immediate ramifications of the ruling, the feasibility of the presidential response, and the broader consequences for U.S. economic governance and global trade dynamics.",

    "The International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) grants the president authority to regulate international commerce during national emergencies, but its use for broad-based tariffs has been contested. Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act allows tariffs for national security reasons, while Section 122 of the Trade Act permits adjustments to address trade deficits. The Supreme Court's ruling highlights ongoing debates about the separation of powers and executive overreach. Tariffs can lead to consumer price increases, trade retaliation, and shifts in global supply chains, affecting macroeconomic indicators like inflation and GDP growth. This article situates the ruling within broader discussions on U.S. trade policy, legal constraints, and economic governance, drawing on expert analysis to assess implications for stakeholders."
