  "title": "Supreme Court and Tariffs: What Happens Next for Shoppers and Money",
  "summary": "The Supreme Court made a big decision about tariffs, which are taxes on things we buy from other countries. They said many of President Trump's tariffs were not allowed. But the president said he will try to keep most of them using different rules. This affects the economy, which is how money moves around. Experts like Natasha Sarin explain that this could mean prices might change for things like toys or clothes. The ruling happened quickly, and now people are watching to see what the president does next. It's important because tariffs can make things cost more or less, and that impacts everyone who shops.",
