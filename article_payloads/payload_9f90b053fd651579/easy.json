  "title": "Belarusian Prisoners Go Free After US Helps",
  "summary": "In Belarus, 123 people who were in prison for speaking out against the government have been released. They include famous protest leaders like Maria Kolesnikova, who smiled and hugged others in a happy video. Another person, Viktor Babaryka, who wanted to be president, was also freed. These people were put in jail because they opposed the leader Alexander Lukashenko, who used force to stop big protests in 2020. The United States helped by talking to Belarus and lifting some sanctions, which are punishments that stop trade. This made Lukashenko happy because he can now talk to the US again. The US might be doing this to improve relations with Russia, since Belarus is a friend of Russia. The prisoners are joyful but remember others still in jail.",

    "Belarus is a country in Europe with a leader named Alexander Lukashenko. In 2020, many people protested against him because they wanted more freedom, but the government used force to stop them. Some protesters were put in jail as political prisoners. The United States and other countries sometimes use sanctions, which are like penalties, to pressure governments to change. Recently, the US talked to Belarus and removed some sanctions, leading to the release of these prisoners. This shows how countries can work together to help people in trouble."
