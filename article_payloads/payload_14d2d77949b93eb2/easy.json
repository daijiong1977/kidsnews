  "title": "How Wolves Change Nature in Yellowstone",
  "summary": "In 1995, scientists brought gray wolves back to Yellowstone National Park after they were almost gone. Wolves are carnivores that eat other animals. People wanted to see if wolves could help fix the environment. Before wolves returned, there were too many elk eating plants near rivers, which hurt the trees and made the land dry. When wolves came back, they scared the elk away from some areas, letting trees like willows grow again. This is called a trophic cascade, where one animal affects many others. But scientists are still learning if wolves really cause big changes. Some studies say yes, others say no. It's a fun puzzle about how nature works together.",

    "Yellowstone National Park is a big wild area in the U.S. where animals and plants live together. Long ago, people hunted wolves until they were almost gone. Without wolves, animals like elk ate too many plants near rivers, making the land dry. Scientists brought wolves back to see if they could help nature recover. This helps us learn how all parts of an ecosystem are connected and why it's important to protect animals."
