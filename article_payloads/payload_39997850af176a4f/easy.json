  "title": "New Rules for Homeowners: Capping Ground Rents",
  "summary": "In England and Wales, the government is making new rules to help people who own homes called leaseholders. Leaseholders pay a yearly fee called ground rent to a freeholder. Now, this fee will be limited to £250 per year, which means it cannot go higher than that. This change is part of a big plan to make home ownership fairer and cheaper. The government also wants to stop selling new leasehold flats and give homeowners more control over their buildings. Prime Minister Keir Starmer announced this in a video, saying it will save people hundreds of pounds. There are about five million leasehold homes, and this rule aims to protect them from high costs. The new law will be checked by MPs before it starts in 2028.",

    "In England and Wales, many people own homes through a system called leasehold. This means they don't own the land or building forever; instead, they have a lease for a set number of years. They pay a yearly fee called ground rent to the freeholder, who owns the property. Sometimes, this fee can increase a lot, making it hard for homeowners. The government is now making changes to help these leaseholders by capping ground rents and giving them more control. This is part of efforts to make housing fairer and more affordable for everyone."
