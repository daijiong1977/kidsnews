  "title": "Reforming Leasehold: Capping Ground Rents and Enhancing Homeowner Rights",
  "summary": "The UK government has announced plans to cap ground rents at £250 per year for leaseholders in England and Wales, as part of broader reforms to the leasehold system. Ground rents are annual fees paid by leaseholders to freeholders, and this cap aims to prevent excessive charges that can burden homeowners. The reforms, detailed in the draft Leasehold and Commonhold Reform Bill, also propose banning the sale of new leasehold flats and giving homeowners greater control over building management. Prime Minister Keir Starmer highlighted the move in a TikTok video, emphasizing it will save leaseholders hundreds of pounds and address cost-of-living concerns. With around five million leasehold homes, the changes respond to fears that high ground rents, which can double or increase with inflation, make properties difficult to sell or mortgage. Additionally, the bill includes abolishing forfeiture, where leaseholders could lose their homes over small debts, and easing conversion to commonhold, a system where occupants jointly own the property. The bill will undergo scrutiny by the Housing Committee and could take effect by late 2028, following Labour's manifesto promise to end the feudal leasehold system.",

    "The leasehold system in England and Wales involves homeowners holding a lease for a property for a fixed period, often decades or centuries, while paying ground rent to a freeholder. This system has been criticized for allowing ground rents to escalate through clauses that double fees or tie them to inflation, creating financial strain and hindering property sales. In 2022, ground rents were abolished for most new leaseholds, but existing homes remained affected. The current reforms build on this by capping rents, banning new leasehold flats, and introducing measures like abolishing forfeiture and promoting commonhold. These changes align with political promises, particularly from Labour, to address affordability and fairness in housing, reflecting broader societal concerns about the cost of living and property rights."
