  "title": "Literary Influence and Resilience: Jojo Moyes' Tribute to Sophie Kinsella",
  "summary": "In an interview on BBC Radio 4's Desert Island Discs, acclaimed author Jojo Moyes disclosed the pivotal role that the late Sophie Kinsella played in the genesis of her internationally bestselling novel, Me Before You. Moyes, experiencing profound depression and financial strain amid a period of scant commercial acclaim, had drafted 20,000 words but contemplated abandoning the manuscript. During a convivial lunch, Kinsella—herself a distinguished novelist—adamantly urged Moyes to persevere, asserting, 'You have to write this book.' This exhortation was subsequently reinforced by Kinsella's husband, Henry, who telephoned Moyes to echo the sentiment. Galvanized by this bolstering, Moyes completed the narrative, which evolved into a literary phenomenon, translated into multiple languages and adapted into a 2016 cinematic production featuring Emilia Clarke and Sam Claflin. The novel's plot, centering on Louisa Clark's care for paraplegic Will Traynor, was inspired by a journalistic account of a quadriplegic rugby player pursuing assisted dying in Switzerland. Moyes reflected on the unforeseen resonance of the work, which interrogates themes of autonomy, disability, and euthanasia. Kinsella, who succumbed to an aggressive glioblastoma at age 55, is eulogized by Moyes not only for her literary prowess but for her indispensable moral support during a nadir in Moyes' vocational trajectory.",
