  "title": "The Encouragement Behind a Bestseller: Jojo Moyes and Sophie Kinsella",
  "summary": "In a recent interview on BBC Radio 4's Desert Island Discs, author Jojo Moyes revealed how the late Sophie Kinsella played a crucial role in the creation of her bestselling novel Me Before You. Moyes was struggling with depression and financial difficulties after years of limited commercial success as a writer. She had written 20,000 words of the novel but considered abandoning it. During a lunch meeting, Kinsella, a fellow author, insisted that Moyes must complete the book, saying, 'You have to write this book.' Later, Kinsella's husband also encouraged Moyes. Inspired by this support, Moyes finished the novel, which went on to become an international bestseller and was adapted into a 2016 film starring Emilia Clarke and Sam Claflin. The story follows Louisa Clark, a working-class carer for Will Traynor, a paraplegic man, and was inspired by a news article about a quadriplegic rugby player seeking assisted dying. Moyes expressed surprise at the book's widespread resonance. Kinsella, who died at age 55 from brain cancer, is remembered by Moyes for her pivotal encouragement during a low point in her career.",
