  "title": "How Combined Sleep Disorders Increase Heart Disease Risk",
  "summary": "Researchers at Yale School of Medicine conducted a study published in the Journal of the American Heart Association, analyzing data from nearly 1 million post-9/11 U.S. veterans. They discovered that adults with both insomnia and obstructive sleep apnea, a condition called comorbid insomnia and sleep apnea (COMISA), face a significantly higher risk of high blood pressure and cardiovascular disease compared to those with only one disorder. Insomnia involves difficulty falling or staying asleep, while sleep apnea causes repeated breathing pauses during sleep. When these conditions overlap, they intensify health effects, as sleep is crucial for cardiovascular regulation, allowing the heart and blood vessels to rest and reset. The study emphasizes that sleep disturbances are common and treatable but often neglected as secondary issues. By evaluating sleep disorders together rather than separately, doctors can identify risks early in the cardiovascular trajectory, potentially preventing advanced disease. The researchers advocate for routine sleep assessment alongside other major risk factors, highlighting that addressing modifiable factors like sleep could reduce the burden of heart disease.",

    "Cardiovascular disease is a leading cause of death worldwide, involving conditions like high blood pressure and heart attacks. Sleep disorders, such as insomnia and obstructive sleep apnea, are common and can disrupt the body's ability to recover during rest. Insomnia makes it hard to fall or stay asleep, while sleep apnea causes breathing interruptions. When these occur together as COMISA, they pose a greater risk to heart health. Researchers at Yale studied U.S. veterans to understand how early sleep issues affect cardiovascular risk. Sleep helps regulate the cardiovascular system by providing recovery time; without it, strain accumulates. This study highlights the need for integrated sleep assessment in medical care to prevent disease progression, as sleep problems are measurable and treatable."
