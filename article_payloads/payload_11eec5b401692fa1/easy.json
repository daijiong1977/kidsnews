  "title": "Sleep Problems Can Hurt Your Heart",
  "summary": "Scientists at Yale School of Medicine studied sleep and heart health. They found that when people have two sleep problems together—insomnia (trouble sleeping) and sleep apnea (breathing stops during sleep)—it can make heart disease risk much higher. This combination is called COMISA. The study looked at data from nearly 1 million U.S. veterans. Sleep helps the heart rest and repair at night. If sleep is disrupted often, the heart doesn't get enough recovery time, which can lead to high blood pressure and other heart issues. The researchers say doctors should check for both sleep problems early to help prevent heart disease. Sleep is important for our health, and fixing sleep issues can protect our hearts.",

    "Sleep is when our bodies rest and heal. Insomnia means you can't fall asleep or stay asleep, while sleep apnea means you stop breathing briefly during sleep. Scientists at Yale studied how these sleep problems affect heart health in U.S. veterans. They found that having both problems together, called COMISA, increases the risk of heart disease. Sleep helps the heart recover at night, so disrupted sleep can strain it. This research shows that checking for sleep issues early might help prevent heart problems."
