  "title": "Medicine Can Cause Surprising Problems",
  "summary": "Some medicines can make people do things they don't want to do, like gamble or shop too much. Emma took a medicine for her legs and started gambling a lot, losing lots of money. She didn't know the medicine was causing it until she read a news story. Over 250 people have told the BBC that similar medicines made them develop addictions. These medicines are given for movement problems like Restless Legs Syndrome. Doctors sometimes don't warn patients about these side effects. A group in the UK is asking for better warnings. Emma changed her medicine and hopes others will learn from her story.",
