  "title": "The Universe Might Shrink Back One Day",
  "summary": "A scientist named Henry Tye studied new information about dark energy, which is a mysterious force in space. He thinks the universe is about 13.8 billion years old and will keep growing for 11 billion more years. Then, it will start to get smaller, like a rubber band snapping back, and eventually collapse into a tiny point in about 20 billion years. This idea is called the \"big crunch.\" He used data from two big observatories, DES and DESI, to make this guess. Before, people thought the universe would grow forever, but the new data suggests it might end differently. This helps us understand how the universe changes over time.",

    "The universe is everything around us, including Earth, stars, and galaxies. Scientists study it to learn how it started and what might happen in the future. Dark energy is a puzzle because we can't see it, but it affects how the universe grows. Observatories like DES and DESI use big telescopes to collect data from space. This article talks about new findings that suggest the universe might not grow forever but could eventually get smaller and collapse, which is a big change from what many people thought before."
