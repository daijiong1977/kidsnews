  "title": "Kylie Minogue's Bid for Christmas Chart Topper",
  "summary": "Kylie Minogue is currently leading the competition for the UK Christmas number one single, according to the Official Charts Company. Her festive track XMAS holds a lead of 7,000 units over Wham's Last Christmas, which has been the top song for the past two years. In third place, close behind, is the charity single Lullaby by Together For Palestine, featuring various artists. If Kylie maintains her position, this would mark her first number one since 2003's Slow, an achievement she describes as emotional and a perfect end to her year. The song is an Amazon exclusive, meaning it benefits from smart speaker requests during the holiday season, boosting its chart eligibility. XMAS was recorded for the 10th anniversary edition of her Kylie Christmas album, which recently topped the album charts. Kylie revealed that the song had been unfinished for years, and she was motivated to complete it to avoid someone else releasing a similar track. Despite her past near-miss in 1988, she won't be in the UK to celebrate, opting instead to spend time with family in Australia.",
