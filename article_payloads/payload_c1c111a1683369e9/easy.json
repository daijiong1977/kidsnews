  "summary": "Kylie Minogue is a pop star who might get the Christmas number one song this year. Her new song called XMAS is ahead of other songs like Wham's Last Christmas and a charity song. If she wins, it will be her first number one since 2003. Kylie is happy and says it would be the best part of her year. Her song is special because it is only on Amazon, so when people ask for Christmas songs, it plays first. She made the song for an album anniversary and had wanted to finish it for a long time. Kylie won't be in the UK to celebrate because she is going home to her family.",
