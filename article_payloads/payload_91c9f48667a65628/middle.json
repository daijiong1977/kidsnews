  "summary": "In a thrilling Australian Open final, Carlos Alcaraz defeated Novak Djokovic to become the youngest man in tennis history to complete a career Grand Slam. At 22 years old, Alcaraz overcame a slow start, losing the first set 2-6, but rallied to win the next three sets 6-2, 6-3, 7-5, securing his seventh major title. This achievement breaks an 87-year-old record previously held by American Don Budge, making Alcaraz only the ninth man ever to win all four Grand Slam tournaments: the Australian Open, French Open, Wimbledon, and US Open. The match, held in Melbourne's Rod Laver Arena, was significant as it halted Djokovic's pursuit of a standalone record 25th major title. Djokovic, aged 38, remains tied with Margaret Court at 24 majors. Alcaraz's victory underscores his emergence as a dominant force in men's tennis, alongside Jannik Sinner, with the pair having won the last nine majors between them. The event was watched by tennis legends like Rafael Nadal, highlighting its importance in the sport's narrative.",
