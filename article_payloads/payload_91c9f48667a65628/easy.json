This victory made him the youngest man ever to win all four major tennis tournaments, called the Grand Slam. Alcaraz lost the first set but came back to win the match with scores of 2-6, 6-2, 6-3, 7-5. He celebrated by falling on the court in joy. Djokovic, who is 38 years old, was trying to win his 25th major title but did not succeed. Alcaraz is now the world number one and has won seven major titles.
