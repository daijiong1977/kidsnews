  "title": "A Writer's Dream Cast for a Movie About Shakespeare",
  "summary": "Maggie O'Farrell wrote a book called Hamnet that tells a made-up story about William Shakespeare and his family. She also helped make a movie from her book. Maggie always wanted actor Paul Mescal to play Shakespeare in the movie because she saw him act in a play in Dublin and thought he was great. The movie is about how the death of Shakespeare's son, Hamnet, might have inspired his famous play Hamlet. It has an Irish feel with actress Jessie Buckley playing Shakespeare's wife, Agnes. Maggie joked that the director, Chloé Zhao, picked Irish actors without holding many auditions. Maggie grew up in Britain but visited Ireland often, which is important to her. She says there are many books about Shakespeare that people love to read.",

    "Hamnet is a story based on the life of William Shakespeare, a famous playwright from England who lived hundreds of years ago. He wrote many plays, like Hamlet, which is about a prince. The movie adapts a book by Maggie O'Farrell, who imagines how Shakespeare's personal life, especially the loss of his son, might have inspired his work. Actors like Paul Mescal and Jessie Buckley bring the characters to life, and the film has connections to Ireland, where some of the cast is from."
