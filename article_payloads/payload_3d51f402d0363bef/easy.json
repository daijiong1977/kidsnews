  "title": "Guinea's First Election After a Coup",
  "summary": "Guinea, a country in Africa, held an election on Sunday to choose a new president. This was the first election since a coup in 2021, when the military took over. The junta leader, General Mamadi Doumbouya, is likely to win because the opposition is weak. Guinea has many minerals like bauxite, but many people are poor and hungry. Young people hope the election will bring better jobs and life. Voting was mostly smooth, but some people boycotted it. The results will come soon, and if no one gets most votes, there will be another round. This election is part of a new rule that lets military leaders run and makes the president's term longer.",

    "Guinea is a country in West Africa with about 15 million people. It has faced political changes, including a coup in 2021 where the military took control. The country is rich in minerals like bauxite, but many citizens struggle with poverty and hunger. Elections are important for choosing leaders who can improve lives, but sometimes people boycott if they feel the process is unfair. This election marks a step after the coup, with hopes for better opportunities, especially for young people."
