  "title": "Minnesota Leaders Ask for Peace During Protests",
  "summary": "In Minnesota, there were protests where people clashed with ICE agents after a man was shot. The man was hurt because he allegedly attacked federal officers. Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey asked everyone to stay calm on the streets. President Trump is threatening to send U.S. troops to the Twin Cities to stop the protests. Governor Tim Walz wants the president to help calm things down. The protests happened again overnight, and Trump talked about using a law called the Insurrection Act. This law lets the president use the military if local leaders cannot keep order. It was last used in 1992 during riots in Los Angeles. Leaders are working to prevent more violence and keep people safe.",
