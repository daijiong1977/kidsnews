  "title": "Skupski Advances to Australian Open Doubles Final with New Partner",
  "summary": "Neal Skupski, a British tennis player, has advanced to the final of the men's doubles at the Australian Open alongside his new American partner, Christian Harrison. As the sixth seeds, they defeated the third-seeded pair Marcel Granollers and Horacio Zeballos in straight sets, 6-3 7-6 (9-7). This marks their first Grand Slam appearance together. Skupski previously partnered with Joe Salisbury throughout 2025, but Salisbury announced a break from tennis due to anxiety, ending their successful run that included reaching multiple Grand Slam finals. Skupski's new partnership with Harrison has quickly proven effective, leading to another final. In an interview with BBC Radio 5 Live, Skupski explained that he chose Harrison because few players were available, and their playing styles complemented each other. He expressed satisfaction with their performance and confidence heading into the final against Australian wildcards Jason Kubler and Marc Polmans. Additionally, Skupski mentioned staying in touch with Salisbury, who is traveling and considering a return to tennis in April. The article highlights Skupski's adaptability and the dynamics of professional doubles partnerships.",
