  "summary": "Neal Skupski from Great Britain is a tennis player who plays doubles, which means he teams up with another player. He has reached the final of the men's doubles at the Australian Open, a big tennis tournament in Australia. He is playing with a new partner named Christian Harrison from America. They won their match against another team to get to the final. Skupski used to play with Joe Salisbury, but Joe is taking a break from tennis because he feels anxious. Now, Skupski and Harrison are happy with how they are playing together. They will play against two Australian players in the final on Saturday. Skupski hopes to win a trophy. He also talked to Salisbury recently and said Salisbury is doing well and might come back to tennis later.",
