  "title": "A Family's Home Ruined by Building Work",
  "summary": "Kate and her son have been homeless for four Christmases because building work on their apartment building made their home unsafe. Workers were adding more flats on the roof, but they did a bad job. The ceiling fell down, and pigeons came in, leaving bird droppings everywhere. Kate and other families in the building are very upset. They tried to get help from courts, but it didn't work well. The building owner didn't answer their questions, and Kate lost a chance to sell her home. Now, the work is stopped, but the building is still messy and dangerous. This story shows how some people can lose their homes because of problems with building rules.",
