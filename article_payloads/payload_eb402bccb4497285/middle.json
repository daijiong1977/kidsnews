  "title": "Leasehold Dispute Leaves Family Homeless After Botched Construction",
  "summary": "Kate Morris and her teenage son are facing their fourth Christmas homeless due to a botched roof extension by contractors working for the freeholder of their block of flats in Ashford, Surrey. The construction caused the ceiling to collapse in Kate's top-floor flat, leading to a pigeon infestation that covered every room in droppings. Kate is among over 1,000 leaseholders who have contacted the BBC about leasehold system disputes. Other residents, like Laura and Tom, also suffered damage and live in uncertainty about safety, especially with their young child. Work was halted by the Health and Safety Executive after safety breaches, leaving the building unfinished and littered with debris. The leaseholders, including Kate, have pursued legal action but with little success, even being ordered to pay £7,000 in legal costs to the businessman they blame. In 2021, Kate was about to sell her flat when the freehold was sold to Magnitude Developments Ltd, with plans for additional flats on the roof. She received no answers to her inquiries, causing the sale to fall through. The leasehold system, originating in the Middle Ages, grants freeholders permanent ownership, while leaseholders have temporary rights, highlighting power imbalances that can lead to severe hardships for residents.",

    "The leasehold system in the UK allows freeholders to own buildings and land permanently, while leaseholders purchase rights to live in properties for fixed terms, often decades or centuries. This system can lead to disputes when freeholders undertake construction or maintenance that harms leaseholders' homes. Cases like Kate's illustrate the challenges leaseholders face in seeking redress through legal channels, especially when freeholders have more resources and control. Understanding this context helps explain why families might become homeless due to bureaucratic and legal hurdles in property disputes."

  "Article_Structure": [
    "Main Points: The article details how a botched roof extension by a freeholder's contractors left Kate Morris and others homeless, with safety breaches halting work and legal efforts proving ineffective. Purpose: To expose flaws in the leasehold system, highlighting resident hardships and power imbalances. Evidence Evaluation: Relies on personal accounts from affected leaseholders and BBC data, but lacks broader statistical analysis. Author Credibility: BBC News is a reputable source, but the article is based on anecdotal evidence without deep investigative reporting. Methodology: Uses interviews with victims and reference to legal documents, providing a human-interest angle but limited empirical data."
