  "title": "A Secret in Tiny Drops: How Scientists See Super-Fast Movements",
  "summary": "Scientists have found a new way to look at liquids like water or sugar water, which are always moving at a tiny molecular level. They used a special tool called high-harmonic spectroscopy (HHS) with very fast laser pulses to take pictures of molecules in liquids. This helps them see how molecules interact, which is important for things like how our cells work. The researchers tested a mix of methanol and a chemical called fluorobenzene and saw something surprising: it produced less light and one color of light disappeared. This showed that the molecules were shaking hands in a special way, called a hydrogen bond. This discovery helps scientists understand liquids better, which could lead to new medicines or materials.",

    "Liquids are all around us, from water we drink to juices. At a tiny level, molecules in liquids are always moving and interacting, which affects things like how medicines work in our bodies. Scientists have struggled to see these fast movements because they happen in billionths of a second. High-harmonic spectroscopy is a new method that uses super-fast lasers to take snapshots, helping reveal secrets like molecular handshakes."
