  "title": "Europe Changes Its Plan with President Trump Over Greenland",
  "summary": "President Trump wants the United States to take control of Greenland, a territory of Denmark, for safety reasons. He says Europe's leaders won't push back much, but they are planning to stand up to him at a big meeting called the World Economic Forum. Greenland is part of Denmark, which is in the European Union and NATO. Trump is pressuring Denmark's friends in these groups to let the US have Greenland or face high taxes on their exports to America. This worries European countries like Germany and Italy, which sell cars and luxury goods to the US. Germany's finance minister said they won't be blackmailed. European leaders had been trying to be gentle with Trump, but now they are changing their approach. They will tell Trump they support Arctic security together, so he doesn't need to act alone on Greenland. At the same time, Europe might put big taxes on US goods or limit American companies in Europe if Trump goes ahead with his plan. This could also affect US consumers.",
