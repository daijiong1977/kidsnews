  "title": "New Church Members with Different Ideas",
  "summary": "This article talks about people like Gareth who are starting to go to church again because they feel worried about changes in society. Gareth went to a rally organized by Tommy Robinson and now thinks Christianity needs support to protect British values. He says things like Christmas markets are being renamed and some areas have many Muslims, which makes him want to help the church. But he doesn't really believe in God; he just wants to support Christian traditions. The church, led by Reverend Jones, is trying to understand these new people while still being friendly to everyone, including Muslims. It's a big challenge for the church to welcome them without agreeing with their fears.",

    "In England, the Church of England is a big Christian church that has been around for a long time. Many people used to go to church, but now fewer do. Tommy Robinson is a well-known person who leads protests and says he became Christian in prison. Some people join his rallies because they worry that British culture is changing, especially with more Muslims in the country. The church leaders have to decide how to talk to these new people without hurting relationships with Muslims and others."
