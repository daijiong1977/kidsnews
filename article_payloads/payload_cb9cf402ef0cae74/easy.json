  "title": "Bad Bunny's Super Bowl Show: A Story of Pride and Unity",
  "summary": "Bad Bunny, a famous singer from Puerto Rico, made history by performing in Spanish at the Super Bowl, which is a big football game in America. His show was like a love letter to Puerto Rico, featuring dancers, flags from different American countries, and a message about love being stronger than hate. He wore a sweater with the number 64 and climbed a pole to remember people who died in a storm. Even though he didn't talk about politics, former President Donald Trump said the show was terrible because he didn't understand the Spanish words. Bad Bunny's performance celebrated his home and brought people together with music and pride.",
