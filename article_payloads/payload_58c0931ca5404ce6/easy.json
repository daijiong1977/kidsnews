  "summary": "A singer named Rose has become very popular on music apps like Spotify, with her songs played millions of times. She sings jazz and soul music that sounds like famous artists. But there is a big mystery: Rose might not be a real person. She has no social media, never performs live, and released many songs very quickly. Experts at a music service called Deezer think her music is made by a computer using AI, which is a type of smart technology. They found clues like a hissing sound in her songs that often happens with AI music. This means Rose could be an AI artist, not a human singer, which is exciting and strange for music fans.",
