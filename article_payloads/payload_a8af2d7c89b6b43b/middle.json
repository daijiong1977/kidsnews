  "title": "Pope Leo XIV Continues Annual Baptism Tradition at Vatican",
  "summary": "Pope Leo XIV conducted a baptism ceremony for 20 infants in the Sistine Chapel, upholding an annual tradition that signifies the conclusion of the Christmas period at the Vatican. The babies, children of Vatican employees, were baptized beneath Michelangelo's frescoed ceiling in a ceremony that commemorates Jesus' baptism in the River Jordan, established by St. John Paul II in 1981. During the event, the Pope emphasized the necessity of faith, comparing it to basic needs like food and clothing, and personally administered the sacrament. He also addressed the crowd in St. Peter's Square, offering blessings to all infants being baptized, especially those in challenging circumstances. Each family received a candle symbolizing Christian light, and the ceremony proceeded smoothly with minimal disruption. This tradition reinforces the importance of religious rituals in the Catholic Church and connects to historical art, as depicted in a fresco by Pietro Perugino on the chapel's wall.",
