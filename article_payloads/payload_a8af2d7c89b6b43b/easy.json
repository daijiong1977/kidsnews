  "summary": "Pope Leo XIV baptized 20 babies in the Sistine Chapel at the Vatican. This is a special tradition that happens every year to mark the end of the Christmas season. The babies are children of people who work at the Vatican. During the ceremony, the Pope talked about how faith is important for life, just like food and clothing are needed to live. He gave each family a candle to represent light and hope. The event celebrates Jesus' baptism and has been done since 1981. The babies were calm and did not cry much during the baptism.",
