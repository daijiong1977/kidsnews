  "title": "How Drinking a Little Alcohol Can Increase Mouth Cancer Risk",
  "summary": "A new study from India shows that drinking even a small amount of alcohol every day, like one drink, can raise the risk of getting mouth cancer by 50%. Mouth cancer is a serious disease that affects the inside of the cheeks and lips, and it is very common in India, causing many deaths each year. The study found that people who drink alcohol and also chew tobacco have an even higher risk, with this combination possibly causing over half of all mouth cancer cases in the country. Researchers looked at thousands of people, some with cancer and some without, to learn about their drinking and tobacco habits. They discovered that locally made alcoholic drinks, often drunk in rural areas, are especially risky. This research helps us understand why it's important to be careful with alcohol and tobacco to stay healthy.",
