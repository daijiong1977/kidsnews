  "title": "Zootropolis 2 Sets New Hollywood Animated Box Office Record",
  "summary": "Zootropolis 2 has achieved a significant milestone by becoming Hollywood's highest-grossing animated film of all time, with global box office earnings of $1.7 billion. This surpasses the previous record held by Inside Out 2, which made $1.69 billion in 2024. The film, a sequel to the 2016 hit Zootropolis, features returning characters like rabbit police officer Judy Hopps and fox con artist Nick Wilde, who investigate a new reptilian resident. Released in November with a $150 million budget, it had the biggest opening weekend for an animated film and was the fastest to reach $1 billion globally. However, it ranks as the ninth most successful film overall in box office history, behind major titles like Avatar and Avengers: Endgame. Notably, the highest-grossing animated movie worldwide remains China's Ne Zha 2, which earned $2.2 billion last year. Disney executives credited the film's success to enthusiastic fans and the creative team behind it.",

    "Zootropolis 2 is a Disney animated sequel released in November, continuing the story from the 2016 film Zootropolis. Animated films involve creating moving images through techniques like computer-generated imagery (CGI) and are a major part of the entertainment industry. Box office performance measures a film's commercial success based on ticket sales, with records often highlighting cultural impact. Hollywood refers to the American film industry centered in California, while global comparisons, such as with China's Ne Zha 2, show how different markets influence worldwide rankings. The film industry uses budgets, opening weekends, and fan engagement to gauge success and plan future projects."
