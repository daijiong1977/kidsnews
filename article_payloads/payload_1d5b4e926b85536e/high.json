  "title": "Zootropolis 2 Achieves Unprecedented Box Office Success in Hollywood Animation",
  "summary": "Zootropolis 2 has cemented its place in cinematic history by becoming Hollywood's highest-grossing animated film ever, amassing $1.7 billion in global box office revenue. This achievement surpasses the previous record held by Inside Out 2, which earned $1.69 billion in 2024, and positions Zootropolis 2 as the ninth most successful film overall globally, trailing blockbusters like Avatar and Avengers: Endgame. As a sequel to the 2016 film Zootropolis, it features protagonists Judy Hopps and Nick Wilde investigating a new reptilian character, with a production budget of $150 million. Released in November, the film set records for the biggest animated opening weekend and was the fastest to reach $1 billion worldwide. However, it does not hold the overall animated crown, as China's Ne Zha 2 remains the highest-grossing animated movie with $2.2 billion, primarily from the Chinese market. Disney executives, including co-chairman Alan Bergman, attributed this milestone to global fan enthusiasm and the creative efforts of the filmmaking team, underscoring the film's cultural and commercial impact within the competitive landscape of international cinema.",
