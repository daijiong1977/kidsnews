    "Daria Kasatkina is a professional tennis player who was born in Russia. In 2022, after Russia invaded Ukraine, she played as a neutral athlete, which means she did not represent any country. She also came out as gay that year and has not returned to Russia since. This made her life difficult, and she felt stressed. Now, she has become an Australian citizen and is excited to play in the Australian Open, a major tennis tournament, as a home player. This change allows her to focus on her sport and feel more at peace."
