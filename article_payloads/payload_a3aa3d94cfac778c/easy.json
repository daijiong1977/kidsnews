  "title": "Genes That Help People Stay Smart as They Get Old",
  "summary": "Scientists studied a special group called super agers. These are people over 80 years old who have memory and thinking skills like much younger adults. They looked at genes, which are like tiny instructions in our bodies. One gene called APOE-ε4 makes it more likely for people to get Alzheimer's disease, a sickness that affects memory. Super agers were less likely to have this bad gene. Another gene called APOE-ε2 helps protect against Alzheimer's, and super agers were more likely to have this good gene. The study used data from over 18,000 people to learn about these genes and super agers. This helps us understand why some people stay sharp for life.",

    "Alzheimer's disease is a common illness in older adults that causes memory loss and thinking problems. Genes are parts of our body that we inherit from our parents and can affect our health. Super agers are rare older people who keep their memory strong, and scientists study them to learn how to help others stay healthy as they age."
