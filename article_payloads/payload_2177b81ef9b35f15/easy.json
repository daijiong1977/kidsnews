  "title": "The Mystery of Ancient Soft Fossils",
  "summary": "Long ago, about 570 million years back, soft creatures like jellyfish lived in the ocean. They didn't have hard shells or bones, so they usually don't become fossils, especially in sandy rocks where water washes things away. But something special happened during the Ediacaran period: these soft animals got buried by sand and left detailed imprints in the rock. Scientists call these fossils the Ediacara Biota, and they look very strange with shapes like spirals or patterns. Finding them helps us learn about early life before more complex animals appeared. Researchers are studying how they were preserved to understand their place in history and what they tell us about ancient seas.",

    "The Ediacaran period was a time on Earth when soft-bodied organisms lived in the oceans. Fossils from this time are rare because soft parts usually rot away before turning into rock. Scientists study them to learn how life evolved and what ancient seas were like. Understanding preservation helps us piece together the history of life on our planet."
