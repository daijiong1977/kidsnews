  "title": "Helicopter Doctors Save More Lives",
  "summary": "Helicopters with doctors on board help save more people who are badly hurt. In a study from England, they looked at over 3,000 patients who got care from a helicopter team. The team flies to help people in accidents or with serious injuries. They found that about 5 extra people survived for every 100 patients treated. This means helicopters can save more lives than expected. The study also showed that younger people and those who got special medicine to sleep during the flight had a better chance of living. The doctors use tools to check how hurt someone is and give quick help. This research helps us understand how helicopter teams make a big difference in emergencies.",

    "In emergencies like car crashes or falls, people can get very hurt and need help fast. Helicopters with medical teams can fly to the scene quickly, even in hard-to-reach places. Doctors on board give advanced care, like checking how serious injuries are and giving medicine. This study from England shows that this quick help saves more lives than expected, especially for those with severe injuries. It teaches us how important fast medical response is in saving people."
