  "title": "Missing Files from Government Website About a Famous Case",
  "summary": "The Justice Department had a website with documents about Jeffrey Epstein, a man involved in a big scandal. At least 16 files disappeared from that website in less than a day, and no one explained why. One of the missing files had a photo showing President Donald Trump with Epstein and others. People are curious about what happened and why they weren't told. Some politicians are asking for more transparency so the public can know the truth. This has made people worry because the documents released didn't give much new information about Epstein's crimes or why he got a light punishment years ago. Important records, like interviews with victims, are still missing.",
