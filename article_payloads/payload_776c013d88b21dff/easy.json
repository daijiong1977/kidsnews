  "title": "A Stuntman's Brave Story from Harry Potter",
  "summary": "David Holmes was a stunt double for Harry Potter in the movies. He did exciting tricks that were too dangerous for the young actor. In 2009, while filming, he had a bad accident that broke his neck and left him unable to move his body. Even though this changed his life, David says it did not change who he is inside. He is still proud of his work on Harry Potter because the movies make people happy and feel safe. He met his partner Rosie, who also cannot move, and they both love the films. David did not blame anyone for the accident and focused on getting better. He knows many people do not have help like he did, so he stays positive.",
