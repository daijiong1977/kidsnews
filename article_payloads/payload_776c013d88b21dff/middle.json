  "title": "Overcoming Adversity: A Stuntman's Journey After a Life-Changing Injury",
  "summary": "David Holmes began his career as a stunt double for Harry Potter at age 17, performing high-risk stunts for actor Daniel Radcliffe. In January 2009, during filming of the seventh film, a harness accident left him paralysed at 24, breaking his neck. Despite this traumatic event, Holmes emphasizes that his core personality remains unchanged. He reflects on his choice of a dangerous profession, accepting responsibility without harboring blame, and highlights the positive impact of Harry Potter on audiences, including providing comfort in conflict zones. His recovery was supported by insurance, which he acknowledges as a privilege, leading him to focus on healing rather than legal action. Holmes found personal solace through his friendship with Radcliffe and a new role in a Harry Potter audio book. He also met his partner Rosie, a quadriplegic who drew strength from the films, illustrating the power of storytelling. Through his experience, Holmes conveys a message of resilience, pride in his contributions, and the importance of finding meaning beyond physical limitations.",
