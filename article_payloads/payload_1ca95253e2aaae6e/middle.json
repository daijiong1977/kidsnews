  "title": "Unveiling Cosmic Mysteries: The Search for Dark Matter and Dark Energy",
  "summary": "Scientists are making progress in understanding the universe's biggest mystery: dark matter and dark energy, which constitute about 95% of the cosmos, with only 5% being ordinary matter. Dr. Rupak Mahapatra, an experimental particle physicist at Texas A&M University, leads efforts to detect these elusive components using advanced semiconductor detectors with cryogenic quantum sensors. These technologies enhance experiments like TESSERACT, aiming to capture rare particle interactions. Dark matter, comprising roughly 27% of the universe, acts as cosmic glue shaping galaxies, while dark energy, about 68%, drives the accelerating expansion of space. Neither emits light, so researchers study their gravitational effects on galactic movements and large-scale structures. Mahapatra's work, including contributions to the SuperCDMS experiment, has introduced innovations like voltage-assisted calorimetric ionization detection to improve sensitivity for low-mass WIMPs, a prime dark matter candidate. He emphasizes the need for multiple approaches—direct, indirect, and collider searches—to piece together a complete understanding, comparing current knowledge to touching only an elephant's tail. This collaborative global effort pushes the boundaries of detection to unravel fundamental cosmic questions.",

    "The universe consists of all matter, energy, and space, with scientists having mapped only a small fraction. Dark matter and dark energy are hypothetical components that dominate the cosmos but remain undetected directly due to their non-luminous nature. Dark matter is inferred from gravitational effects on galaxies, while dark energy explains the observed acceleration of cosmic expansion. Research involves particle physics experiments like SuperCDMS and TESSERACT, which use sensitive detectors to capture rare interactions. Dr. Rupak Mahapatra's work at Texas A&M focuses on advancing detection technologies, such as cryogenic sensors, to probe low-mass particles like WIMPs. Understanding these elements is crucial for cosmology, as they influence the universe's structure and evolution, with ongoing global collaborations aiming to solve one of science's greatest puzzles."
