  "title": "The Hidden Universe: Dark Matter and Dark Energy",
  "summary": "Scientists are trying to solve a big mystery about the universe. Most of the universe, about 95%, is made of dark matter and dark energy, which we cannot see. Only 5% is the normal matter we know, like stars and planets. Dr. Rupak Mahapatra, a scientist at Texas A&M University, is working on special detectors to find dark matter. These detectors use cold sensors to catch rare particles. Dark matter helps hold galaxies together, while dark energy makes the universe expand faster. Scientists study them by looking at how gravity affects things in space. Dr. Mahapatra compares our understanding to touching only an elephant's tail, meaning we know very little. His work is important for learning more about the universe.",

    "The universe is everything around us, including stars, planets, and space. Scientists have learned a lot, but most of it is still a mystery. Dark matter and dark energy are invisible parts that make up 95% of the universe. They don't give off light, so we can't see them directly. Instead, scientists use tools like detectors to find clues. Dr. Rupak Mahapatra and his team work on making better detectors to solve this puzzle. Understanding these hidden parts helps us learn how the universe works and grows."
