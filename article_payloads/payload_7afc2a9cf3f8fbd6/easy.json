    "In Scotland, the government creates a budget each year to decide how to spend money on things like housing, schools, and transport. This affects people's lives, especially young adults trying to move out and low earners. Budget Day is important because it shows what the government prioritizes. Housing can be expensive, and some people need help from local councils to afford homes. Understanding this helps see why Megan and Alan share their stories."
