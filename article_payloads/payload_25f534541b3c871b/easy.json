  "title": "Flu Medicine for Kids: Surprising New Discovery",
  "summary": "Doctors used to worry that a flu medicine called Tamiflu might cause seizures and confusion in children. But new research shows that the flu itself is the real problem, not the medicine. The study found that kids who took Tamiflu when they had the flu were less likely to have serious brain issues like seizures. In fact, Tamiflu helped prevent these problems. The researchers looked at health records of over 600,000 children in Tennessee over four years. They saw that children with the flu had more brain issues, but those who took Tamiflu had fewer. This means families can feel safer using Tamiflu to treat the flu in kids, as it helps protect them from dangerous symptoms.",

    "The flu is a common illness that affects many children every year. Doctors often prescribe medicines like Tamiflu to help kids feel better faster. In the past, some people worried that Tamiflu might cause scary problems like seizures or confusion in children. This made families unsure about using it. New research from a children's hospital in Tennessee looked at health records to see if this was true. They found that the flu, not Tamiflu, is what causes these brain issues. In fact, Tamiflu can help reduce the risk. This study helps doctors and parents make better decisions to keep kids safe during flu season."
