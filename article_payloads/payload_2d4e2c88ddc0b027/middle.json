  "title": "Observing a Star's Quiet Collapse into a Black Hole",
  "summary": "Astronomers have directly observed a massive star, known as M31-2014-DS1, skip a supernova explosion and collapse into a black hole. Located about 2.5 million light-years away in the Andromeda Galaxy, this star was studied using data from NASA's NEOWISE mission and other telescopes from 2005 to 2023. The star brightened in infrared light in 2014, then its brightness dropped sharply by 2016, and by 2022-2023, it had nearly vanished in visible and near-infrared wavelengths, fading to one ten-thousandth of its former brightness. Researchers concluded that the core collapsed under gravity to form a black hole, with the outer layers pushed outward gradually. This provides detailed insights into how stellar black holes form, challenging the idea that all massive stars explode in supernovae. The findings, published in Science, may help explain why some stars collapse quietly while others explode. Lead author Kishalay De notes that light from debris around the black hole will be visible for decades with telescopes like the James Webb Space Telescope, offering a benchmark for future studies. The research also revisited a similar object, NGC 6946-BH1, highlighting the role of convection in understanding failed supernovae.",

    "Massive stars, at least 10 times more massive than the sun, end their lives when nuclear fuel runs low, causing gravity to overwhelm outward pressure. Typically, this leads to a core collapse that may form a neutron star, with a shock wave creating a supernova explosion. However, theoretical models suggest that if the shock wave is too weak, the star can fall back inward, turning a neutron star into a black hole without a supernova. This study observed such an event with star M31-2014-DS1, using archived and fresh telescope data to track brightness changes. The findings help refine theories on stellar evolution and black hole formation, offering a rare glimpse into quiet collapses. Understanding these processes is crucial for astrophysics, as it explains diversity in star deaths and the origins of black holes in the universe."
