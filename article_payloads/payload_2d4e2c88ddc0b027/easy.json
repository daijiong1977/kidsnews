  "title": "A Star That Became a Black Hole Without a Big Bang",
  "summary": "Astronomers watched a big star in space change into a black hole without exploding. This star was in the Andromeda Galaxy, far away. It got very bright and then became very dim quickly. Scientists used telescopes to see this happen over many years. They learned that not all big stars explode at the end of their lives. Some just collapse quietly into black holes. This helps us understand how black holes are born in space. The star's light faded slowly, and scientists can keep watching it for decades with powerful telescopes like the James Webb Space Telescope. This event is special because it gives a clear view of how stars turn into black holes.",

    "Stars are big balls of gas that shine in space. When they get old, some explode in a big bang called a supernova. But scientists found a star that didn't explode. Instead, it collapsed into a black hole, which is a place where gravity is super strong. This happened in the Andromeda Galaxy, which is very far away. Astronomers used telescopes to watch this over many years. This helps us learn more about how stars end their lives and how black holes are born in the universe."
