  "title": "A Young Volcano on Mars Hides a Magma Engine Below",
  "summary": "Scientists have discovered that a young volcano on Mars has a hidden magma engine beneath its surface. This volcano, located near a big mountain called Pavonis Mons, did not erupt just once but many times over a long period. Using pictures and mineral data from space, researchers found that the magma system under the volcano was active and changed over time. Each eruption left different minerals, which helped scientists track how the magma evolved. This study shows that Mars has complex volcanic activity, similar to Earth, and helps us learn about the planet's interior without needing to collect rocks directly.",

    "Mars is a planet in our solar system known as the Red Planet because of its rusty color. It has volcanoes, some of which are very big, like Olympus Mons. Scientists study Mars using robots and spacecraft that take pictures and collect data from orbit. Volcanoes on Mars can tell us about the planet's history and what's inside it, similar to how volcanoes on Earth work. This article talks about a young volcano that erupted many times, showing that Mars has active geological processes."
