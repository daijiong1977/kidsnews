  "title": "A Big Computer Farm in Scotland: Good or Bad?",
  "summary": "In East Ayrshire, Scotland, a company called ILI Group wants to build a huge data centre on farmland. This is like a big computer farm that helps run artificial intelligence. Supporters say it will bring new jobs and money to the area, which could help the community grow. But some local people are worried. They think the data centre might use too much water and energy, and it could change the countryside. The company says most of the land will be for plants and animals, but residents want more details. This is part of a bigger trend where many data centres are being built around the world. The article looks at both sides: the hope for jobs and the fear of harm to the environment.",

    "Data centres are large buildings filled with computers that help store and process information for things like the internet and artificial intelligence. They need a lot of electricity to run and water to cool the computers so they don't overheat. In places like Scotland, building new data centres can create jobs and bring money to local areas, but people sometimes worry about how much resources they use and if they might harm the environment or change the countryside. This article talks about a plan in East Ayrshire where a company wants to build one, and local residents have different opinions about it."
