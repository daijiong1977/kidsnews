  "title": "Data Centre Debate in Ayrshire: Economic Boost vs. Environmental Concerns",
  "summary": "In East Ayrshire, Scotland, the energy firm ILI Group has proposed building a massive artificial intelligence data centre on 100 hectares of farmland near HMP Kilmarnock. This development, part of a larger cluster called the Stoics across multiple Scottish sites, aims to be one of the world's largest AI data centres. Supporters argue it could revitalize the region by creating jobs and injecting investment into the local community, potentially boosting the economy. However, the plan faces strong opposition from residents, particularly in Hurlford, who are concerned about the environmental impact. Critics highlight the facility's high energy consumption—estimated at 540MW—and its need for millions of litres of water daily for cooling, which could strain local resources. The article notes that this is part of a global trend, with billions being spent on AI data centres, but also growing awareness of their resource demands. ILI emphasizes that the project is in early stages and includes biodiversity areas, yet locals demand more concrete details about long-term effects.",

    "Data centres are critical infrastructure for the digital age, supporting everything from internet services to artificial intelligence. They require significant amounts of electricity to power servers and water for cooling systems to prevent overheating. In recent years, there has been a surge in data centre construction globally, driven by AI advancements, with estimates of trillions of dollars being invested. However, this growth raises environmental concerns, as these facilities can consume vast resources, impacting local ecosystems and contributing to carbon emissions. In Scotland, proposals like ILI Group's Stoics cluster reflect this trend, aiming to boost local economies through job creation but sparking debates over sustainability. Understanding these dynamics involves looking at balancing technological progress with environmental stewardship and community interests."
