  "title": "A Rare Octopus Found on a Beach in Scotland",
  "summary": "A strange creature washed up on a beach in Scotland. It was found by a person walking at Forvie National Nature Reserve. Experts say it is a seven-arm octopus, which is very rare. This octopus lives deep in the ocean, far below the surface. It has eight arms like other octopuses, but in males, one arm is used for mating. The octopus can grow very big, up to 13 feet long for females. Reserve staff were surprised because they usually see smaller octopuses. At first, people thought it might be a giant squid, but it was not. This discovery helps scientists learn more about deep-sea animals.",

    "Octopuses are amazing sea creatures that can change color and have eight arms. They live in oceans all over the world. Some octopuses, like the seven-arm octopus, are very rare and live deep underwater where it is dark. Scientists study them to learn about life in the deep sea. Beaches in Scotland, like Forvie, are protected areas where animals like seals and birds live. Finding a deep-sea octopus on a beach is unusual because they usually stay far from shore."
