  "title": "Wales' Post-Brexit Sustainable Farming Scheme: A New Era for Agriculture",
  "summary": "Wales has implemented the Sustainable Farming Scheme (SFS), a post-Brexit subsidy program designed to replace previous EU payments with a focus on environmental sustainability. The scheme requires farms to manage at least 10% of their land as habitat to qualify for entry-level payments, which has raised concerns among dairy farmers who may struggle to meet this criterion. After initial versions were criticized as unworkable, leading to significant protests in 2024, negotiations resulted in a revised framework that includes 12 universal actions, such as maintaining hedgerows, reducing pesticide use, and attending online sustainability courses. Additional funding is available for more ambitious environmental projects and collaborative efforts. Farming unions, like NFU Cymru, have expressed cautious approval, noting the scheme is now acceptable but requires further tweaks and budget adjustments to address inflation. The rural affairs secretary hailed it as a landmark moment, emphasizing the importance of farmer participation. This shift marks a generational change in farm support, moving from area-based EU subsidies to performance-based incentives for greener practices.",

    "The Sustainable Farming Scheme (SFS) in Wales represents a major shift in agricultural policy following Brexit. Previously, Welsh farms received over £300 million annually from EU subsidies, distributed based on land area. Post-Brexit, the UK government needed to create a new support system, leading to the SFS, which emphasizes environmental stewardship. The scheme requires farms to adopt sustainable practices, such as habitat management and reduced chemical use, to qualify for payments. Initial proposals faced backlash from farmers, culminating in protests in 2024, prompting revisions. The current framework aims to balance economic support for farms with ecological benefits, reflecting broader trends in green agriculture. Understanding this context helps explain the scheme's significance and the mixed reactions from the farming community."
