  "title": "Wales' New Green Farming Plan After Brexit",
  "summary": "Wales has started a new plan to help farmers after leaving the EU. This plan gives money to farms that do things to help the environment, like taking care of land and using fewer chemicals. Farmers must manage at least 10% of their land as a habitat to join. Some farmers are happy, but others, like dairy farmers, find it hard because their land might not qualify. There were protests before because people thought the plan was not good, but after talks, it is now better. The government says this is a big moment for Wales. Farms used to get money from the EU based on how much land they had, but now they get paid for being green. The plan has rules like keeping hedges healthy and learning about sustainable farming online. More money is available for farms that do extra environmental work. People hope many farmers will join to make the countryside better.",

    "After Brexit, Wales needed a new way to support farmers because they used to get money from the EU. This new plan, called the Sustainable Farming Scheme, focuses on helping the environment by paying farms to do green things like taking care of habitats and reducing chemicals. Some farmers find it challenging, especially dairy farmers, but after protests and talks, the plan has been improved. It's a big change for Welsh agriculture, aiming to make farms more sustainable and protect the countryside."
