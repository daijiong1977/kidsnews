  "title": "Taliban Leaders Disagree: A Story About Afghanistan's Internet Shutdown",
  "summary": "This article talks about a big problem inside the Taliban, the group that rules Afghanistan. The BBC found out that the Taliban leader, Hibatullah Akhundzada, is worried about fights among his own people. He gave a secret speech saying these fights could make the Taliban fall apart. The BBC did a long investigation by talking to many people who know about the Taliban. They discovered two groups in the Taliban. One group, led by Akhundzada from Kandahar, wants Afghanistan to be very strict and closed off from the world. The other group, based in Kabul, wants Afghanistan to be more open, build its economy, and let girls go to school beyond primary level. This disagreement might explain why the internet was shut down in Afghanistan, as the leaders try to control information. The article shows that even powerful groups can have internal problems that affect a whole country.",
