  "title": "Internal Taliban Conflict: The Power Struggle Behind Afghanistan's Internet Shutdown",
  "summary": "The BBC's investigation reveals a significant rift within the Taliban leadership in Afghanistan, centered on a leaked audio clip of supreme leader Hibatullah Akhundzada. In a speech to Taliban members in Kandahar in January 2025, Akhundzada expressed fears that internal disagreements could lead to the collapse of the Islamic Emirate. This prompted a year-long BBC investigation involving over 100 interviews with Taliban insiders, experts, and diplomats, uncovering two competing factions. One faction, loyal to Akhundzada and based in Kandahar, advocates for a strict, isolated Islamic state controlled by religious figures. The other, based in Kabul and including cabinet ministers and militants, supports engagement with the outside world, economic development, and expanded education for girls beyond primary school. This power struggle, described as 'Kandahar house versus Kabul,' highlights tensions over Afghanistan's future direction and may explain recent actions like internet shutdowns as leaders attempt to maintain control. The article underscores the challenges of governance and internal conflict within authoritarian regimes.",

    "The Taliban regained control of Afghanistan in 2021 after the withdrawal of US forces, establishing the Islamic Emirate with a strict interpretation of Sharia law. Afghanistan has a history of conflict and political instability, with the Taliban facing international isolation due to human rights concerns, particularly regarding women's rights and education. Internal divisions within authoritarian groups are common as different members advocate for varying approaches to governance, such as isolation versus engagement. The BBC's role as a news organization involves investigative journalism to uncover hidden truths, often relying on confidential sources in sensitive regions. This context helps explain the significance of the Taliban's internal rift and its potential impact on Afghan society and global relations."

    "The article's main points include the leaked audio of Akhundzada warning about internal collapse, the BBC's investigation revealing two Taliban factions with competing visions, and the implications for Afghanistan's future.

Evidence evaluation shows reliance on leaked audio and over 100 interviews, though sources are anonymized for safety, which may affect verifiability.
