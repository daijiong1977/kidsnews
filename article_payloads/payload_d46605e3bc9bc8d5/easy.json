  "title": "What is the Trump Doctrine?",
  "summary": "This article talks about a new idea called the Trump Doctrine. It is about how President Trump wants to use strong actions, like pressure and military power, in foreign policy. This means the U.S. might use force not only against enemies but also against friends. The article includes views from two experts: Todd Robinson, who was a U.S. ambassador in Venezuela, and Andrés Martínez-Fernández from The Heritage Foundation. They discuss how this doctrine changes America's role in the world, especially in Latin America. The focus is on being more aggressive and less restrained, which is different from past policies. The article helps us understand what the Trump Doctrine is and why it matters.",
