  "title": "Critical Perspectives on the Trump Doctrine: Diplomatic and Analytical Insights",
  "summary": "This article delves into the Trump Doctrine, a foreign policy paradigm under President Trump characterized by the strategic application of pressure and military might, potentially extending to both adversaries and allies. It presents nuanced perspectives from Todd Robinson, a former U.S. ambassador to Guatemala and the top diplomat in Venezuela who was expelled, and Andrés Martínez-Fernández of The Heritage Foundation. The analysis explores how this doctrine signifies a pivot from restrained foreign policies to a muscular, aggressive approach, redefining 'America First' through a framework of regional domination in the Western Hemisphere, evoking 19th-century imperial strategies. The article contextualizes this within the ongoing fallout from Trump's intervention in Venezuela, examining broader implications for U.S. global hegemony, diplomatic relations, and ethical considerations in international affairs. It offers a critical assessment of the doctrine's coherence, effectiveness, and alignment with historical precedents, highlighting debates over sovereignty and power dynamics.",
