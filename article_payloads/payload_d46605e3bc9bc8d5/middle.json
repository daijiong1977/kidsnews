  "title": "Analyzing the Trump Doctrine: Views from Experts",
  "summary": "This article examines the Trump Doctrine, a foreign policy approach under President Trump that emphasizes the application of pressure and military might, potentially targeting both adversaries and allies. It features perspectives from Todd Robinson, a former U.S. ambassador to Guatemala and top diplomat in Venezuela who was expelled, and Andrés Martínez-Fernández from The Heritage Foundation. They discuss how this doctrine represents a shift from restrained policies to a more muscular and aggressive stance, particularly in the Western Hemisphere, redefining 'America First' through a lens of regional domination reminiscent of 19th-century strategies. The article highlights the ongoing fallout from Trump's actions in Venezuela and explores the implications for U.S. global positioning, offering a nuanced look at the pivot in America's role on the world stage.",
