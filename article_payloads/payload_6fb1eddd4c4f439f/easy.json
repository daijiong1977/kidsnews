  "title": "Chocolate Locked Up in Stores to Stop Thieves",
  "summary": "In some UK shops, chocolate bars are being put in special plastic boxes that lock to stop people from stealing them. Stores like Sainsbury's are doing this because thieves are taking chocolate to sell it later. Police have seen videos of people grabbing lots of chocolate from stores. This stealing hurts businesses and makes workers feel scared. Last year, shops had over 5 million thefts, and workers faced abuse daily. One store group lost £250,000 from chocolate theft. They are spending money on security to keep chocolate safe.",

    "In the UK, shops sell many items like chocolate, which is popular but can be expensive. Sometimes, people steal things from stores, which is against the law. Stealing hurts store owners because they lose money and have to spend more on security. It also makes store workers feel unsafe when they have to deal with thieves. Police work to stop thefts by sharing videos and catching criminals. Stores are trying new ways, like locking up chocolate, to prevent theft and keep everyone safe."
