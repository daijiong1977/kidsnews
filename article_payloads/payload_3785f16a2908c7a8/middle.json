  "summary": "Clair Obscur: Expedition 33, a French-developed role-playing game, achieved a remarkable victory at The Game Awards by winning Game of the Year and eight additional categories out of ten nominations. This record-breaking performance included awards for best narrative, music, and performance, surpassing competitors like Death Stranding 2 and Hades 2. Set in a world where a supernatural entity called The Paintress inhibits aging, the game follows adventurers on a quest to defeat her, praised for its emotional depth and traditional turn-based combat system. The development studio, Sandfall Interactive, was formed by former Ubisoft employees pursuing their creative vision, adding a compelling backstory to the game's success. During the Los Angeles ceremony, director Guillaume Broche highlighted the studio's unconventional journey and thanked online tutorial creators for their guidance. With twelve nominations, Clair Obscur was the most-nominated game in the awards' history. Composer Lorien Testard, discovered via SoundCloud, won for best score, while actress Jennifer English secured best performance, dedicating her award to neurodivergent individuals. The event also featured previews of new games like Tomb Raider sequels and a Star Wars RPG.",
