  "title": "Mining in Myanmar Hurts People and Nature",
  "summary": "In Myanmar, a country in Asia, people are mining rare earths, which are special metals used in things like phones and cars. The mining is happening in areas controlled by armed groups, and many workers like Sian go there to earn money because jobs are hard to find. They use chemicals to get the metals from the mountains, but this makes the water and soil dirty, hurting plants, animals, and people. Rivers get poisoned, and forests are cut down. China buys most of these metals, but the mining causes big problems in Myanmar. Experts say it's very harmful, and it's hard to stop because the work is secret and rules are weak. This story shows how mining can damage places and lives.",

    "Myanmar is a country in Southeast Asia with many forests and mountains. Since 2021, there was a military coup, which made the economy weak, so people struggle to find jobs. Rare earths are important metals used in modern technology like smartphones and electric cars. Mining means digging up these metals, but it can hurt nature by polluting water and cutting down trees. In some parts of Myanmar, armed groups control areas, and they allow mining that doesn't follow rules, causing problems for local communities and the environment."
