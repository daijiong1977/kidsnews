  "title": "Should We Pay Extra for Holidays in England?",
  "summary": "Some business leaders in England are asking the government to stop a new tax on holidays. The government wants to let local leaders charge a small fee to tourists staying in hotels or other places. This money would help pay for local projects. But over 200 companies that run hotels, theme parks, and holiday spots say this tax is a bad idea. They think it will make holidays more expensive, so families might take shorter trips or go to other countries instead. They wrote a letter to the government saying, \"Holidays are for relaxing, not taxing.\" The government is still deciding and will listen to opinions until February. In Scotland and Wales, local areas can already charge this tax, but Northern Ireland does not plan to. Some places in England already have a similar fee that businesses choose to add, but it is not a required tax.",

    "In England, the government is thinking about letting local leaders add a small tax to holidays. This means if you stay in a hotel, you might pay a little extra money. The idea is to use this money to make local areas better, like building parks or fixing roads. But many businesses that help people on holiday, like hotels and theme parks, do not like this idea. They worry it will make holidays too expensive, so families might not come or might go to other countries. The government is asking people what they think before making a decision. In some other parts of the UK, like Scotland and Wales, local areas can already do this, but it is not the same everywhere."
