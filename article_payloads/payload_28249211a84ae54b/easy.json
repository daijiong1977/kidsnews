  "title": "A Famous Building Gets a New Name",
  "summary": "The Kennedy Center, a big performing arts building in Washington DC, is getting a new name. The White House says the board voted to call it the Trump-Kennedy Center. They did this because President Trump helped save the building with money and repairs. Trump was surprised and happy about it. But not everyone agrees. Some people on the board say the vote was not fair because they were muted and could not speak against it. Kennedy's family is upset because the building is a memorial to President John F. Kennedy. The change might cause arguments because many people love the old name.",
