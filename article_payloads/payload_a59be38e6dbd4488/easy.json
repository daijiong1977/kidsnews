  "title": "Olivia Dean and Lola Young Lead Brit Award Nominations",
  "summary": "Olivia Dean and Lola Young are two new music stars who have many nominations for the Brit Awards this year. They each have five nominations, including for artist of the year. Other famous singers like Lily Allen and Dave are also nominated. Sam Fender has four nominations after winning another prize. The band Pulp is nominated again after a long time since 1996, when their singer Jarvis Cocker did a funny protest on stage. He jumped on stage during a Michael Jackson show and made funny moves, which got him in trouble but no charges. Now, Pulp is happy to be nominated for their new music. Olivia Dean might win best artist and best album because her album is very popular. She says it feels crazy to have so many nominations.",
