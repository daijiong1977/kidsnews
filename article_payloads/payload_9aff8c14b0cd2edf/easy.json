  "title": "The Government Shutdown Deal",
  "summary": "The government shutdown, which was the longest ever, is almost over. A deal to reopen the government passed in the Senate on Monday night, but it won't end for at least one more day. This means that many government workers can go back to their jobs soon. However, there are still many questions about what will happen next. For example, people are wondering if the government will stay open or if there might be another shutdown. Lisa Desjardins, a reporter, is explaining all of this to help us understand. It's important because government shutdowns affect many people, like those who work for the government and those who use government services.",

    "A government shutdown happens when leaders can't agree on a budget, so government offices close and workers might not get paid. This shutdown was the longest in U.S. history, causing problems for many people. The Senate is part of Congress that helps make laws, and passing a deal means they voted to end the shutdown. Reporters like Lisa Desjardins share news to keep everyone informed."
