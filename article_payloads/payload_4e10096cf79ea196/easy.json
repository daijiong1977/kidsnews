  "title": "UK Homes Get Money for Solar Panels to Save on Bills",
  "summary": "The UK government has announced a big plan to help families save money on their energy bills. They will give £15 billion over five years to put solar panels, heat pumps, and batteries in homes. This is called the Warm Homes Plan. It aims to make more homes use solar power and help one million people who struggle to pay for heating. The Prime Minister says every family should have a warm home. Some people like the plan because it can cut bills by £500 a year, but others worry it might cost too much to run. The money will come as loans and grants to make it easier for people to afford these green technologies.",

    "In the UK, many families spend a lot of money on heating and electricity, which are called energy bills. Solar panels are a way to use sunlight to make power, which can reduce these bills. The government has created a plan to help more homes get solar panels and other green technologies to save money and help the environment. This plan is important because it aims to make homes warmer and cheaper to run, especially for people who find it hard to pay for energy."
