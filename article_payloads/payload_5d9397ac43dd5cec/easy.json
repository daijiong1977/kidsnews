  "title": "Jack's Big Tennis Adventure in Dallas",
  "summary": "Jack Pinnington Jones is a young tennis player from Britain who had an exciting week at the Dallas Open. He started by playing in qualifying matches to get into the main tournament. Then, he beat two tough players, including Flavio Cobolli, who is ranked number 20 in the world. This was the biggest win of Jack's career. He made it to the quarter-finals, but there he lost to Marin Cilic, a famous player who won the US Open in 2014. Even though he lost, Jack will move up in the world rankings, going from 181st to 138th. He decided to skip his last year of college to play tennis full-time, and this week showed he is getting better. In another tournament, a teenager named Victoria Mboko also did well by beating top players to reach the final.",
