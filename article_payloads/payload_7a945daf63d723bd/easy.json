  "title": "A New Planet That Might Have Aliens",
  "summary": "Scientists have found a new planet called a super-Earth that is not too far away from us. It is 20 light-years away, which is very far, but it is one of the closest planets we know that could have life. This planet is in the habitable zone, which means it is not too hot or too cold, so water could be there. Water is important for life as we know it. The discovery was made using special tools called spectrographs and by watching the sky for many years with telescopes. This is exciting because it gives us a great chance to look for signs of aliens, like tiny living things. Scientists are hopeful and will keep studying this planet to learn more.",

    "Space is huge, and scientists look for planets around other stars. Some planets, like Earth, are in the habitable zone where conditions might support life. This new super-Earth is exciting because it is close enough to study with telescopes, and finding life there would be a big discovery. Scientists use tools like spectrographs to analyze light and learn about planets."
