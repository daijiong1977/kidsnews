  "title": "Why Skin Rash Can Hurt Joints",
  "summary": "Some people with a skin rash called psoriasis get sore joints later. This joint problem is called psoriatic arthritis. Scientists have found out why this happens. They discovered that special cells from the skin can travel through the blood to the joints. In the joints, these cells meet other cells that should protect the joint. But in people who get psoriatic arthritis, the protective cells don't work well. This lets the skin cells cause inflammation and pain in the joints. The good news is that doctors might be able to find these traveling cells in the blood early. This could help stop joint damage before it starts by treating people sooner.",

    "Psoriasis is a common skin condition where people get red, scaly patches on their skin. It happens because the immune system, which protects the body, becomes overactive and attacks the skin. Sometimes, this can lead to problems in other parts of the body, like the joints. Joints are where bones connect and allow movement, such as in fingers or knees. When joints get inflamed, they can hurt and swell up, making it hard to move. Scientists study these issues to find ways to help people feel better and prevent damage."
