  "title": "Alfie Hewett Wins in Singles but Loses in Doubles at Australian Open",
  "summary": "Alfie Hewett is a British wheelchair tennis player who did very well at the Australian Open. He won his singles match against his friend and doubles partner Gordon Reid, which means he gets to play in the semi-finals. Hewett is trying to keep his singles title from last year. In the singles semi-finals, he will face Martin de la Puente from Spain. But in doubles, Hewett and Reid lost their match to players from Japan and Argentina, so they cannot win the doubles title this time. They had won many doubles titles before. Other players from Great Britain and Australia are also doing well in a different doubles event. The Australian Open is a big tennis tournament where players compete in singles and doubles matches.",
