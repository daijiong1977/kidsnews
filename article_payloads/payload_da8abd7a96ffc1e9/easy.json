  "title": "Italy Wins Big Tennis Match to Reach Final",
  "summary": "In an exciting tennis match, Flavio Cobolli from Italy played against Zizou Bergs from Belgium in the Davis Cup. The match was very close and went into a long tie-break, which is like a mini-game to decide the winner. Cobolli saved seven match points, which are chances for his opponent to win, and finally won after a 32-point tie-break. He was so happy that he took off his shirt to celebrate with the home fans in Bologna. This victory means Italy will play in the final against Spain or Germany. Cobolli said it was one of the best days of his life because he fought hard for his country, team, and family. Italy is trying to win the Davis Cup for the third time in a row, something no country has done in over 50 years.",

    "The Davis Cup is a famous international tennis tournament where teams from different countries compete. It started over 100 years ago. Italy has won it the last two years and is trying to win again, which would be a big achievement.
