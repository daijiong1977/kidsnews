    "The Davis Cup is one of the premier international team events in tennis, founded in 1900. It involves a knockout format where national teams compete over several rounds. Italy has been successful recently, winning the last two editions, and is now aiming for a third straight title, a feat not accomplished since Australia in 1968-70. Tie-breaks were introduced to tennis in the 1970s to prevent endlessly long sets, and a 32-point tie-break is exceptionally rare and dramatic. Key players like Jannik Sinner and Lorenzo Musetti were absent for Italy, showing the team's depth. Understanding these elements helps appreciate the significance of Cobolli's victory and Italy's potential historic achievement in the context of tennis history."
