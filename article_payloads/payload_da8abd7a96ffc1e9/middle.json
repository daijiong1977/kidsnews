    "The Davis Cup is the premier international team event in men's tennis, founded in 1900 and organized by the International Tennis Federation. It features teams from over 100 countries competing in a knockout format, with matches consisting of singles and doubles rubbers. Italy has a rich tennis history and is currently the two-time defending champion, having won in 2022 and 2023. Reaching three consecutive finals is a rare feat; the last time it happened was by Australia in the 1960s. Tie-breaks were introduced to tennis in the 1970s to resolve tied sets, and long tie-breaks like the 32-point one in this match are memorable for their intensity and drama. Players often face immense pressure when representing their country, and victories in such contexts can define careers."
