The match, held in Bologna, lasted over three hours and ended with Cobolli winning 6-3, 6-7 (5-7), 7-6 (17-15), sparking wild celebrations among the home crowd. This tie-break is the sixth-longest in Davis Cup history, highlighting the intensity of the contest. Cobolli expressed that achieving this win was one of the best moments of his life, emphasizing the emotional effort he put in for his team, family, and country. Italy's captain, Filippo Volandri, praised Cobolli's performance, noting that it was 95% heart and only 5% tactics, and highlighted the team's strong bench support, including Matteo Berrettini who won his match earlier. With this win, Italy advances to the final against Spain or Germany, aiming to become the first nation in 53 years to win three consecutive Davis Cup titles, despite missing top players like Jannik Sinner and Lorenzo Musetti.",

    "The Davis Cup is one of the premier international team events in tennis, founded in 1900 and often called the 'World Cup of Tennis.' It involves a knockout format where countries compete in ties consisting of singles and doubles matches. Italy has been successful recently, winning the last two editions, and aims for a historic third consecutive title, a feat not achieved since Australia in the late 1960s. Flavio Cobolli, ranked 22nd globally, is part of a new generation of Italian players stepping up in the absence of stars like Jannik Sinner. Tie-breaks were introduced to tennis in the 1970s to resolve sets efficiently, and long tie-breaks like this one are rare and memorable, often decided by mental toughness and clutch performance under pressure."
