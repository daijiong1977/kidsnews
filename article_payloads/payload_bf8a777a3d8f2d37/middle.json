  "title": "Sabalenka Breaks Tie-Break Record to Advance in Australian Open",
  "summary": "Aryna Sabalenka, a two-time Australian Open champion, secured a victory over Victoria Mboko with scores of 6-1, 7-6 (7-1) in the fourth round. This win marked her 20th consecutive tie-break triumph at Grand Slam tournaments, surpassing Novak Djokovic's previous record of 19. Sabalenka demonstrated resilience by recovering her composure after nearly losing a 4-1 lead in the second set, ultimately clinching the match in a tie-break. She attributes her success to a focused, point-by-point approach and the psychological pressure it places on opponents. With this win, Sabalenka advances to the quarter-finals against Iva Jovic, a rising teenage star, and extends her streak of reaching at least the quarter-finals in 13 consecutive Grand Slam appearances. Experts like Annabel Croft commend her incredible record and self-trust under stress, while Daniela Hantuchova notes her unwavering plan during tie-breaks. Sabalenka aims for a fourth successive final in Melbourne, having won in 2023 and 2024 but lost last year's final to Madison Keys.",
