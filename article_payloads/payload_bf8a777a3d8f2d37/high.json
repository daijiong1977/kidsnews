  "title": "Sabalenka's Record-Breaking Tie-Break Consistency Propels Her to Australian Open Quarter-Finals",
  "summary": "Aryna Sabalenka, the reigning two-time Australian Open champion, demonstrated exceptional mental fortitude and tactical prowess in her fourth-round victory over Victoria Mboko, securing a 6-1, 7-6 (7-1) win. This triumph marked her 20th consecutive tie-break victory at Grand Slam tournaments, surpassing Novak Djokovic's Open era record of 19, a feat that underscores her dominance in high-pressure scenarios. Despite nearly relinquishing a 4-1 lead in the second set, Sabalenka regained composure to clinch the tie-break, attributing her success to a disciplined, point-by-point mindset that minimizes psychological overwhelm. Her consistent performance has propelled her to a quarter-final clash against Iva Jovic, an 18-year-old rising star, extending her streak of reaching at least the quarter-finals in 13 consecutive Grand Slam appearances. Sabalenka's trajectory includes aiming for a fourth successive final in Melbourne, having claimed titles in 2023 and 2024 but falling short in last year's final against Madison Keys. Expert commentators, such as Annabel Croft and Daniela Hantuchova, laud her unwavering self-trust and strategic clarity during tie-breaks, highlighting how her record exerts psychological pressure on opponents. This achievement not only solidifies her status as a top contender but also reflects broader trends in tennis regarding mental resilience and record-setting in the sport's elite competitions.",
