  "title": "Is the BBC in Safe Hands?",
  "summary": "A group of important people in the UK government are worried about the BBC, which is a big TV and radio company. The head of a committee, Dame Caroline Dinenage, said that Samir Shah, who is in charge of the BBC board, did not give clear answers when he talked to them. She thinks the BBC might not be in 'safe hands' because of problems with how they report news fairly. Recently, two top leaders at the BBC quit after a disagreement about editing a speech by Donald Trump. Shah promised to 'steady the ship' and fix things, but some people are not sure he can do it. The BBC is now looking for a new leader to help make things better.",
