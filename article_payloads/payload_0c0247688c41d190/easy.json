  "title": "Trump Wants Peace in Gaza Soon",
  "summary": "President Donald Trump wants to move quickly to the next step of a peace plan for Gaza. He met with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to talk about this plan. The plan has two phases. In phase one, a ceasefire started in October. In phase two, Hamas, a group in Gaza, must give up its weapons, and Israel will pull back its soldiers. Then, rebuilding Gaza can begin. Trump warned Hamas that if they do not disarm, there will be big trouble. He also said Israel is following the plan well. Some people worry that Netanyahu might delay the plan or that Hamas wants a Palestinian state first. Trump is not worried about Israel but about others not doing their part.",

    "This article is about a peace plan for Gaza, a place where there has been fighting between Israel and Hamas. A peace plan is a set of steps to stop violence and help people live peacefully. President Trump from the United States is working with Israel's leader to make this happen. The plan has two parts: first, a ceasefire to stop fighting, and second, Hamas giving up weapons so rebuilding can start. Some people have different ideas about how fast this should happen or what should come first, like having a Palestinian state."
