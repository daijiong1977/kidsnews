  "title": "A Hidden Chemical Rain from Old Refrigerators and Medicines",
  "summary": "Scientists have discovered a new type of pollution called an invisible chemical rain falling all over Earth. This rain comes from chemicals used in old refrigerators and some medicines that help people sleep during surgery. These chemicals break down in the air to form a substance called TFA, which is a forever chemical because it doesn't go away easily. Between 2000 and 2022, about 335,500 tonnes of TFA fell from the sky onto land and water. The problem is getting worse because these chemicals stay in the air for a long time, and more TFA will keep coming down for many years. Researchers at Lancaster University used computer models to figure this out and checked their work with real samples from ice and rain. TFA might harm fish and other water animals, and it has been found in people's bodies too, so scientists are worried about its buildup. They say we need to think carefully when replacing bad chemicals to avoid new problems.",

    "Pollution is when harmful things get into our air, water, or land. Chemicals are substances made by people for things like keeping food cold in refrigerators or helping patients sleep during surgery. Some chemicals, called forever chemicals, don't break down easily and can stay in nature for a very long time, which might hurt animals and people. Scientists study pollution to understand how it spreads and what effects it has, so we can protect our planet."
