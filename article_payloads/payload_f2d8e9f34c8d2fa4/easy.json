  "title": "Space Force Wants Faster Space Tools",
  "summary": "A Space Force leader named Maj. Gen. Stephen Purdy says the military is happy with its rocket companies but needs better space tools called payloads. Payloads are things like sensors that help satellites see and do jobs in space. The Space Force wants to build payloads faster, in one week instead of two to three years, so they can launch missions quickly. They are giving money to small companies to make new payloads, like infrared sensors that can spot missiles or fires. The Space Force already has many rockets and satellites for communication, but payloads are the last part they need to improve. This will help them protect the country and do space missions better.",

    "The Space Force is a branch of the U.S. military that focuses on space operations. They use satellites to watch Earth, communicate, and keep the country safe. Payloads are important parts of satellites that carry tools like cameras or sensors. Building these tools quickly helps the military respond to threats faster. The article talks about how the Space Force is working with companies to make better payloads, so they can do their jobs more efficiently in space."
