  "title": "Greenland's Big Meeting: What It Means for the Island",
  "summary": "Greenland is a big island in the Arctic, and it's getting a lot of attention because of a meeting in Washington, D.C. The meeting involves leaders from the United States, Denmark, and Greenland. People in Greenland are worried because former U.S. President Donald Trump has said he wants to take control of Greenland. Greenlanders like Amelie and Sivnîssoq say their country is not for sale and they want to be independent. The meeting could affect Greenland's future and relationships between countries. Greenland is part of Denmark but has some control over itself. If the U.S. tries to take Greenland, it might hurt alliances like NATO. This is a big deal for Greenlanders who are anxious about what will happen next.",

    "Greenland is the world's largest island, located in the Arctic. It is a semi-autonomous territory of Denmark, meaning it has some control over its own affairs but Denmark handles defense and foreign policy. The United States has shown interest in Greenland because of its strategic location and resources. Meetings like the one in Washington can shape how countries interact and affect people's lives in Greenland."
