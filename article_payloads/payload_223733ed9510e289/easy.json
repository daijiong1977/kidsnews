  "title": "Judge Stops Report on Trump's Papers",
  "summary": "A judge named Aileen Cannon, who was chosen by former President Trump, has decided to stop a report about how Trump handled secret papers after he left office in 2021. The report was made by special counsel Jack Smith and led to charges against Trump, but the judge dismissed the case in 2024. Two watchdog groups are trying to get the report released by a higher court. In other news, Trump is warning countries to follow trade deals they made, or he might raise taxes on them. The Supreme Court will also hear a case from oil and gas companies trying to stop lawsuits about climate change. This article talks about these three big stories from the news.",
