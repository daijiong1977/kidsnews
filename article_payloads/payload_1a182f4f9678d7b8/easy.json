  "title": "Private Photos Accidentally Shared Online",
  "summary": "Some private photos and videos of people were accidentally put online in files about a bad man named Epstein. These files were supposed to hide the names and faces of the victims to protect them, but mistakes happened. Officials in the United States were told about the problem, but some images stayed online for days. This made the victims very sad and hurt because their privacy was broken. Lawyers and victims spoke out, asking for the website to be fixed. The government said it was a mistake and is working to remove the images and check for more errors. The BBC found that some photos were still visible even after promises to fix them. This shows how important it is to be careful with private information online.",
