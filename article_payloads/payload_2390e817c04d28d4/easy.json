  "title": "WH Smith's Money Mistake Investigation",
  "summary": "WH Smith, a store company in the UK, is being checked by a financial regulator because it made a big mistake with its money numbers in North America. The mistake might have made the company look like it earned more money than it really did, by as much as £50 million. Because of this, the company's boss left, and its share price dropped a lot. WH Smith also sold many of its High Street shops and now focuses on stores in places like airports and train stations. The company is working to fix its money problems and plans to improve its stores in the future. It says it was a tough end to the year and wants to rebuild trust with people who invest in it.",
