  "title": "WH Smith Under Regulatory Scrutiny for Accounting Errors",
  "summary": "The UK's Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) is investigating WH Smith after the retailer discovered significant accounting mistakes in its North America business, which may have overstated revenues by up to £50 million. This error led to delayed annual results, the resignation of chief executive Carl Cowling, and a 40% drop in share price. WH Smith has also restructured by selling its High Street shops, now rebranded as TG Jones, and focusing on its remaining 1,300 branches in transport hubs like airports and railway stations. The company reported a pre-tax profit of £108 million for the year, excluding one-off costs, but profit forecasts were downgraded due to the accounting issues. Interim CEO Andrew Harrison acknowledged the challenging situation and emphasized efforts to strengthen financial controls and governance. Additionally, WH Smith plans to overhaul its stores in 2026 to create one-stop-shops for travel essentials, responding to broader market demands. The investigation highlights concerns about corporate transparency and investor confidence in the retail sector.",
