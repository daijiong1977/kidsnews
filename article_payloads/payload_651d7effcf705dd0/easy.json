  "title": "A Lost Amazon World Found in Bolivia",
  "summary": "In 2021, scientists explored a hidden part of the Amazon in Bolivia called the Great Tectonic Lakes. They found old earthworks, canals, and raised fields that show people lived there long ago, from about 600 to 1400 CE. These people built structures to manage water and grow crops like maize in the wetlands. They ate fish, reptiles, and plants from the area. Today, Indigenous communities like the Cayubaba and Movima still live there and help protect this special place. The discovery reveals how ancient people adapted to their environment and left behind a rich history.",

    "The Amazon is a big rainforest in South America, home to many plants, animals, and people. In Bolivia, there are wetlands with lakes shaped by earth movements. Long ago, people lived there and built things to survive, like canals for water and fields for growing food. Today, Indigenous groups still live there and share their knowledge. This article talks about scientists finding old remains that tell us about these ancient communities and how they adapted to their environment."
