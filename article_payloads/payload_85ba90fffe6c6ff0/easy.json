  "title": "Big Trade Deal Between Europe and South America",
  "summary": "The European Union and a group of South American countries called Mercosur signed a big trade agreement. This deal took over 25 years to make and helps them trade more easily by removing most taxes on goods. It makes shopping cheaper for over 700 million people in Europe and South America. The signing happened in Asunción, Paraguay. Leaders like Ursula von der Leyen from Europe and Lula da Silva from Brazil said it promotes fair trade and cooperation instead of fighting over tariffs. The deal is important because it shows countries working together even when others like the U.S. are raising tariffs. Mercosur includes Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay, and Uruguay, with Bolivia able to join later. This agreement creates one of the world's largest free trade zones.",
