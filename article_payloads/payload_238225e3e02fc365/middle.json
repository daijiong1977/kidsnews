  "title": "Melinda French Gates Addresses Bill Gates' Connection to Jeffrey Epstein in New Documents",
  "summary": "Melinda French Gates, a prominent philanthropist and ex-wife of Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates, has publicly discussed the emotional impact of new documents released by the U.S. Department of Justice that mention Bill Gates in relation to Jeffrey Epstein, a convicted sex offender. In an interview with NPR's Wild Card podcast, Melinda expressed 'unbelievable sadness' over the Epstein allegations and stated that Bill and others named need to answer questions about their involvement. She revealed that these documents dredge up 'painful times' from her 27-year marriage, which ended in divorce in 2021. The documents include emails allegedly drafted by Epstein in 2013, making claims about Bill Gates, such as having a sexually transmitted disease, but it is unclear if they were sent. Bill Gates has denied these allegations as 'absolutely absurd' and false, with his representatives emphasizing he has not been accused of wrongdoing by Epstein's victims. This situation highlights ongoing scrutiny of high-profile individuals' associations with Epstein and the personal toll on families.",
