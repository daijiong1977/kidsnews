  "title": "Dinosaurs and Mammals: How They Raised Their Babies Differently",
  "summary": "Scientists have discovered a big difference between dinosaurs and mammals: how they took care of their babies. Dinosaurs, like Brachiosaurus, laid eggs and had many babies at once. The baby dinosaurs grew up quickly and left their parents to live with other young dinosaurs. They found their own food and protected themselves from predators. In contrast, mammals, such as tigers and elephants, stay with their mothers for a long time. The mothers feed and protect them until they are almost grown up. This difference means that baby dinosaurs acted like separate animals from their parents, eating different foods and living in different places. This helps scientists understand why dinosaur ecosystems were so diverse, with many types of animals living together.",

  "background_read": [
    "This article talks about how dinosaurs and mammals raised their babies differently. Dinosaurs, like Brachiosaurus, had many babies from eggs, and the babies grew up fast and lived on their own. Mammals, like tigers, keep their babies with them for a long time, feeding and protecting them. Scientists found that this difference made dinosaur ecosystems more diverse because baby and adult dinosaurs acted like separate animals, eating different foods and living in different places. This helps us learn about ancient worlds and how animals lived together."
