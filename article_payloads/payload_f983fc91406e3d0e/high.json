  "title": "Association Between Mediterranean Diet Adherence and Reduced Stroke Incidence in a Longitudinal Cohort of Women",
  "summary": "A longitudinal study published in Neurology Open Access in 2026 examined the relationship between adherence to a Mediterranean diet and stroke risk among 105,614 women, with an average age of 53 and no prior stroke history. Participants were assessed using a diet questionnaire at baseline, assigning scores from zero to nine based on consumption of key components such as whole grains, fruits, vegetables, legumes, olive oil, fish, and moderate alcohol, while penalizing high red meat and dairy intake. Over a mean follow-up of 21 years, 4,083 strokes were recorded, including 3,358 ischemic and 725 hemorrhagic strokes. After adjusting for covariates like smoking, physical activity, and hypertension, multivariate analysis revealed that women in the highest diet score group (scores 6-9) had an 18% lower overall stroke risk compared to the lowest group (scores 0-2), with a 16% reduction for ischemic stroke and a 25% reduction for hemorrhagic stroke. The study underscores the potential role of dietary patterns in stroke prevention but cautions that the observational design only indicates correlation, not causation. Limitations include reliance on self-reported dietary data, which may introduce recall bias, and the need for mechanistic investigations. Funded by the National Institute of Neurological Diseases and Stroke, the research contributes to growing evidence on nutrition and cerebrovascular health.",

    "Stroke remains a leading cause of mortality and morbidity globally, with modifiable risk factors like diet playing a crucial role in prevention strategies. The Mediterranean diet, characterized by high intake of plant-based foods, fish, and monounsaturated fats, has been extensively studied for its cardioprotective effects. This research builds on prior evidence by employing a large, long-term cohort of women, utilizing detailed dietary scoring and adjusting for multiple confounders to strengthen validity. However, as an observational study, it cannot establish causality, and limitations such as self-report bias highlight the need for complementary experimental designs. Understanding these nuances is essential for interpreting public health implications and guiding future research into dietary interventions and stroke mechanisms."

    "Main Points: The study demonstrates a significant inverse association between Mediterranean diet adherence and stroke risk in women, with specific risk reductions for ischemic and hemorrhagic strokes. Purpose: To explore dietary influences on stroke prevention in a female cohort, addressing gaps in long-term evidence. Evidence Evaluation: Evidence is robust due to large sample size and longitudinal design but tempered by self-reported data risks. Author Credibility: Sophia S. Wang, PhD, brings expertise from a cancer research institution, though direct neurology background is not specified. Methodology: Utilized questionnaire-based dietary assessment and scoring over 21 years, with multivariate adjustment for confounders. Critical Assessment: Strengths include long follow-up and comprehensive adjustment; limitations involve potential recall bias and inability to infer causation, suggesting need for randomized trials."
