  "title": "Eating Healthy Foods Can Help Lower Stroke Risk",
  "summary": "A new study shows that women who eat a Mediterranean diet, which includes lots of fruits, vegetables, and fish, might have a lower chance of having a stroke. Strokes happen when blood flow to the brain is blocked or when there is bleeding in the brain. The study followed over 100,000 women for about 21 years and found that those who ate the healthiest had 18% fewer strokes. This diet focuses on healthy foods like olive oil and limits things like red meat. The researchers say eating well is important for preventing strokes, but they note that the study doesn't prove the diet stops strokes directly—it just shows a link. They also mention that people might not remember their diets perfectly, which is a limitation.",
