  "title": "Mediterranean Diet Linked to Reduced Stroke Risk in Women",
  "summary": "A study published in Neurology Open Access in 2026 found that women adhering to a Mediterranean diet have a significantly lower risk of stroke. The research involved 105,614 women with an average age of 53, who were followed for about 21 years. Participants completed diet questionnaires and were scored on how closely their eating habits matched the Mediterranean diet, which emphasizes vegetables, fruits, legumes, fish, and olive oil while limiting red meat and dairy. Results showed that women with the highest diet scores had an 18% lower overall stroke risk, including 16% lower for ischemic strokes and 25% lower for hemorrhagic strokes, after adjusting for factors like smoking and high blood pressure. The study highlights the importance of diet in stroke prevention but notes it only shows an association, not causation. Limitations include self-reported dietary data, which may be inaccurate. Researchers call for further studies to confirm findings and explore underlying mechanisms.",

    "Stroke is a major cause of death and disability worldwide, often linked to lifestyle factors such as diet. The Mediterranean diet is well-known for its health benefits, including reducing risks of heart disease and other chronic conditions. This study adds to existing evidence by focusing on women and long-term outcomes, using a large cohort and detailed scoring. Understanding dietary associations can inform public health strategies, but it's important to recognize that observational studies like this one cannot prove cause and effect, highlighting the need for further research."

    "Main Points: The study found that women following a Mediterranean diet had an 18% lower stroke risk, with specific reductions for ischemic and hemorrhagic strokes. Purpose: To investigate the association between dietary patterns and stroke risk in women, contributing to stroke prevention research. Evidence Evaluation: The evidence is strong due to a large sample size and long follow-up, but limited by self-reported data. Author Credibility: Led by Sophia S. Wang, PhD, from a reputable cancer center, adding expertise. Methodology: Used diet questionnaires and scoring over 21 years, adjusting for confounders like smoking."
