  "title": "World Leaders Meet to Help Ukraine Stay Safe",
  "summary": "French President Emmanuel Macron is having a big meeting in Paris with Ukraine's leader Volodymyr Zelensky and leaders from over 30 countries. They are trying to make a plan to keep Ukraine safe if there is a peace deal with Russia. Russia invaded Ukraine in 2022 and still controls parts of it. The leaders want to agree on security guarantees, which are promises to protect Ukraine if Russia attacks again. They also talk about helping Ukraine's army and economy. This meeting is important because Ukraine needs support from other countries to feel secure. The talks happen while there are other world events, like actions in Venezuela, but the focus is on helping Ukraine.",
