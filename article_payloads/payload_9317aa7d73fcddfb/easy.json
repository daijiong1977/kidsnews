  "title": "Food Banks in Trouble Across the Country",
  "summary": "Food banks are places that give free food to people who need it. Right now, many food banks in the United States are having a hard time because there is not enough food and too many people asking for help. This is happening because prices for food are going up, and the government is giving less help. During a government shutdown, programs like SNAP, which gives money for food, were stopped, making things worse. Even though the shutdown is over, more cuts are coming. Food bank leaders, like Eric Cooper from San Antonio, say it has been a tough year, and they are working hard to help everyone. This is important because it affects families, especially during the holidays when people need more support.",

    "Food banks are important community organizations that help people who do not have enough money for food. They rely on donations from individuals, companies, and government programs. SNAP, or the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, is a key source of help for low-income families to buy groceries. Government shutdowns can pause these benefits, making it harder for people to eat. Rising food prices mean that everyone, including food banks, has to pay more for the same amount of food. Understanding this helps us see why food banks are essential and need support, especially during tough times like holidays."
