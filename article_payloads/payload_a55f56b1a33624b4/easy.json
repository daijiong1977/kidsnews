  "title": "Why Vet Bills Can Be So Expensive for Pets",
  "summary": "This article tells a story about a woman named Helene who had to pay a lot of money for her dog's medical care. Her dog, Rowan, got sick and needed emergency treatment, which cost £1,600. Later, Rowan was diagnosed with cancer, and Helene had to take a loan of £10,000 to pay for more treatment because her insurance didn't cover it all. She was upset because she felt the vet didn't handle her complaint well. The article explains that the government is making new rules to help pet owners. Vets will have to show their prices for common treatments like vaccinations and microchipping, so people can compare and choose the best option. This is to make things fairer for pet owners and improve vet standards. Many families in the UK have pets, so this is important news.",

    "This article is about how expensive it can be to take care of pets when they get sick. Many families have pets like dogs and cats, and they love them very much. Sometimes, pets need to go to the vet for check-ups or emergencies, which can cost a lot of money. Insurance can help pay for some costs, but not always all of it. The government is creating new rules to make vets show their prices so pet owners can compare and find the best deals. This is part of efforts to make things fair and improve how vets work, as it's the first big change in 60 years. Understanding this helps kids learn about responsibility, money, and how rules can protect people and their pets."
