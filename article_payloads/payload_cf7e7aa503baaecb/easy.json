  "title": "A Ski Bar Fire in Switzerland",
  "summary": "A fire happened at a ski bar in Switzerland on New Year's Eve, and many people were hurt or died. Families are sad and surprised because the bar had not been checked for safety in five years. Officials said the bar should have been checked every year to make sure it was safe. The fire started when sparklers on champagne bottles lit up foam on the ceiling. The bar managers are being investigated, and they said they are very sorry. The mayor promised to ban sparklers in bars to prevent more fires. Most of the people who were hurt or died were young, and some are still in the hospital. This story shows why safety checks are important to keep people safe.",

    "In Switzerland, bars and other places where people gather need to be checked regularly to make sure they are safe. This is called a safety inspection. It helps prevent accidents like fires. When a place is not checked, it can be dangerous because things like fire exits or materials might not be safe. This article talks about a fire that happened because sparklers were used in a bar, and it shows why rules and checks are important to protect everyone, especially young people who go to these places."
