  "title": "Viruses in Space Change in Cool Ways",
  "summary": "Scientists sent tiny viruses called phages to space on the International Space Station to see what happens. These viruses normally infect bacteria on Earth. In space, where there is almost no gravity, the viruses could still infect bacteria, but it took a bit longer. Both the viruses and the bacteria changed in new ways in space. The viruses got better at attacking bacteria, and the bacteria learned to protect themselves. This study helps us understand how living things adapt in space and might help fight bad germs on Earth too.",

    "Scientists study how tiny viruses and bacteria behave in space because it's different from Earth. In space, there's microgravity, which means things float and don't have much weight. This can change how living things grow and interact. By sending experiments to the International Space Station, researchers learn new things that might help keep astronauts healthy or find ways to fight diseases on Earth."
