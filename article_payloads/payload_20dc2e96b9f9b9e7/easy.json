  "title": "Tiny Plastics Harm the Ocean's Cooling Power",
  "summary": "Scientists found that tiny plastic pieces called microplastics are hurting the ocean's ability to soak up carbon dioxide, which helps keep Earth cool. Microplastics are very small plastic bits that are everywhere, even in the ocean. They can carry bad stuff that harms animals and people. In the ocean, they mess with tiny plants and animals called phytoplankton and zooplankton, which are important for moving carbon around. This makes it harder for the ocean to take carbon out of the air. The study says this is a big problem because it could make Earth warmer and hurt sea life. Researchers from different countries worked together and want people to act fast to stop plastic pollution to help fight climate change.",

    "Microplastics are small plastic pieces that come from things like bottles and bags breaking down. They spread all over the world and can be harmful. The ocean is important because it absorbs carbon dioxide, a gas that can make Earth too warm if there's too much. Tiny plants and animals in the ocean help with this by moving carbon around. Scientists are worried that microplastics are stopping this process, which could lead to more warming and problems for sea creatures and people."
