  "title": "Investigation Reveals Locksmith Overcharging Scam",
  "summary": "The BBC conducted a secret investigation into bait-and-switch scams by locksmiths, focusing on a company called 24/7 Locksmiths UK. After receiving numerous complaints, the BBC filmed a locksmith attempting to charge nearly 10 times the original quote of £40. A case study involved Maureen and Eric Reynolds, an elderly couple locked out of their London home in December. They were quoted £49 initially, but the locksmith, upon arrival, claimed he couldn't use a standard tool to extract the key and insisted on drilling the door. After their grandson left, the locksmith alleged further issues with the lock, leading to a final invoice of £2,802, with a note that VAT was not charged, though the BBC suspects the company isn't VAT-registered. The poor-quality work required the couple to pay an additional £2,244 for a full door and frame replacement. The company has since ignored BBC inquiries and shut down its website, highlighting the deceptive practices in some emergency service industries.",
