  "title": "A Locksmith Tricked People with High Bills",
  "summary": "A locksmith was secretly filmed by the BBC trying to charge much more money than promised. Many people complained about a company called 24/7 Locksmiths UK. One couple, Maureen and Eric, who are 85 years old, got locked out of their home. They called the locksmith, who said it would cost about £40 to help them. But after the work was done, the locksmith gave them a bill for over £2,800. The locksmith also did a bad job, so the couple had to pay another £2,244 to fix the door properly. The company did not answer the BBC's questions and closed its website. This is called a bait-and-switch scam, where people are tricked with a low price first, then charged a lot more later.",
