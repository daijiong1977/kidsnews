  "title": "Ancient Chinese Herb for Hair Growth",
  "summary": "Hair loss is a common problem that affects many people. Scientists are studying an ancient Chinese herb called Polygonum multiflorum, which has been used for over a thousand years to help hair grow and stay black. This herb works in different ways to help hair follicles, the tiny parts of skin where hair grows. It reduces a hormone that can shrink hair follicles, protects them from dying too soon, and helps blood flow to the scalp to bring more oxygen and nutrients. Unlike some medicines that have side effects, this herb might be safer and gentler. Researchers looked at old records and new science to learn about it, but more studies are needed to be sure it works well for everyone.",

    "Hair loss, also called baldness, happens when hair falls out and doesn't grow back. It can affect people of all ages and is often caused by hormones or genetics. Traditional Chinese medicine uses plants and herbs to treat health problems, and scientists are now testing these old remedies with modern tools to see if they really work. This helps find new and safer ways to help people with common issues like hair loss."
