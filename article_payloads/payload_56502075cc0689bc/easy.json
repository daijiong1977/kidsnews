  "title": "How Dirty Air Makes Exercise Less Helpful",
  "summary": "Scientists found that breathing polluted air can make exercise less good for your health. They studied over 1.5 million adults in many countries for more than ten years. People who exercised regularly had a lower risk of dying, but in places with dirty air, this benefit was smaller. The pollution comes from tiny particles called PM2.5 that get into our lungs and blood. Even though exercise still helps, clean air makes it work better. Experts say we should try to reduce air pollution to stay healthy while being active.",
