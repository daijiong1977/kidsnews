  "title": "Spain Advances to Davis Cup Final Against Italy After Hard-Fought Victory",
  "summary": "Spain has secured a spot in the Davis Cup final by defeating Germany in a thrilling match that went down to a deciding doubles encounter. The Spanish team, led by captain David Ferrer, started strong with Pablo Carreno Busta winning his singles match against Jan-Lennard Struff. However, Germany's Alexander Zverev evened the score by beating Jaume Munar, forcing a doubles decider. In the crucial doubles, Marcel Granollers and Pedro Martinez triumphed over Kevin Krawietz and Tim Puetz with a score of 6-2, 3-6, 6-3. This marks Spain's first final appearance since 2019, as they aim for their seventh Davis Cup title. They will face Italy, the two-time defending champions, who advanced by beating Belgium. Both teams are dealing with significant absences: Spain is without world number one Carlos Alcaraz due to injury, while Italy misses world number two Jannik Sinner and Lorenzo Musetti. The final is scheduled for Sunday in Bologna, Italy, and this will be the first Davis Cup meeting between Spain and Italy in 19 years. Captain Ferrer expressed pride in his team's resilience and emphasized the need to prepare for the challenging final against a strong Italian side.",
