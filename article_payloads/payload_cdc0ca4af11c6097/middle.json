  "title": "Spain Advances to Davis Cup Final Against Italy After Hard-Fought Victory",
  "summary": "Spain has secured a spot in the Davis Cup final by defeating Germany in a thrilling semifinal match that went down to a deciding doubles encounter. The tie began with Pablo Carreno Busta giving Spain an early advantage by winning his singles match against Jan-Lennard Struff. However, Alexander Zverev, ranked world number three, leveled the score for Germany by defeating Jaume Munar. In the crucial doubles, the Spanish pair Marcel Granollers and Pedro Martinez, who had previously helped in the quarter-finals, emerged victorious over Kevin Krawietz and Tim Puetz with a score of 6-2, 3-6, 6-3. This marks Spain's first final appearance since 2019, as they aim for a seventh Davis Cup title. Notably, both Spain and Italy are competing without their top-ranked players; Spain is missing Carlos Alcaraz due to injury, while Italy lacks Jannik Sinner and Lorenzo Musetti. The final is scheduled for Sunday in Bologna, Italy, and will be the first Davis Cup meeting between the two nations in 19 years. Spain's captain, David Ferrer, expressed pride in his team's effort and anticipation for the challenging match against Italy.",
