  "title": "Spain Advances to Davis Cup Final Against Italy After Tough Win",
  "summary": "Spain has secured a spot in the Davis Cup final by defeating Germany in a thrilling match that went down to a deciding doubles encounter. The victory was highlighted by Pablo Carreno Busta's win in the opening singles against Jan-Lennard Struff, giving Spain an early advantage. However, Germany's Alexander Zverev, ranked third in the world, fought back to defeat Jaume Munar, leveling the tie and forcing a doubles decider. In the crucial doubles match, Marcel Granollers and Pedro Martinez, who had previously helped Spain in the quarter-finals, delivered a strong performance to beat Kevin Krawietz and Tim Puetz in three sets. This marks Spain's first final appearance since 2019, as they aim for their seventh Davis Cup title. The absence of injured world number one Carlos Alcaraz adds challenge, but the team remains motivated. They will face Italy, the two-time defending champions, in the final in Bologna. Italy, missing top players like Jannik Sinner and Lorenzo Musetti, earned their place by beating Belgium. This final is significant as it is the first Davis Cup meeting between Spain and Italy in 19 years, with team captains David Ferrer and Filippo Volandri having played in their last encounter in 2006. Ferrer expressed pride in his team's effort and excitement for the upcoming match, emphasizing the need to rest and prepare for a competitive final against Italy's skilled squad.",
