  "title": "Community Gathers in Silent Tribute After Swiss Alpine Bar Fire",
  "summary": "Hundreds of mourners participated in a silent march in Crans-Montana, Switzerland, to honor the victims of a devastating fire at Le Constellation bar on New Year's Eve, which resulted in 40 fatalities and numerous severe injuries. The event began with a Mass at Chapelle Saint-Christophe, where somber attendees, many emotional, listened to organ music before proceeding up a hill to the bar. The procession passed shuttered stores under bright sunlight, with snow machines adding to the solemn atmosphere. At the bar, shielded by white screens, the crowd stood in near silence, weeping, then applauded rescue teams and police for their efforts. A makeshift memorial accumulated flowers, toys, and tributes. Local resident Véronique Barras emphasized the importance of unity and support in the face of tragedy, while Cathy Premer shared her daughter's experience of being trapped during the celebration of her 17th birthday. Paola Ponti Greppi, an 80-year-old Italian resident, called for enhanced safety checks in bars to prevent similar incidents, questioning the town's oversight. The Mass addressed the uncertainty faced by families regarding their loved ones' fates. This gathering highlighted community resilience and the need for improved safety measures in public venues.",
