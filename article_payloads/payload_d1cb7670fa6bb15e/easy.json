  "title": "A Silent Walk to Remember Fire Victims in Switzerland",
  "summary": "In Switzerland, hundreds of people walked quietly to honor those who died or got hurt in a fire at a bar on New Year's Eve. The fire happened in a mountain town called Crans-Montana and caused 40 deaths and many injuries. On Sunday, after a church service, mourners marched up a hill to the bar, which is called Le Constellation. They stood silently in front of the bar, which is covered with white screens, and then clapped for rescue workers and police who helped. People left flowers and toys at a memorial to show they care. A local resident said it's important to support each other and be kind. Another person shared that her daughter was celebrating her birthday when the fire happened and got stuck. An older woman called for better safety checks in bars to prevent such tragedies. The event brought the community together to remember and heal.",
