  "title": "Royal Piano Duet Highlights Christmas Themes of Love and Connection",
  "summary": "Princess Catherine and Princess Charlotte performed a piano duet for the Together at Christmas carol service, which was pre-recorded at Windsor Castle and broadcast on ITV1 on Christmas Eve. The performance featured a piece by Scottish composer Erland Cooper called Holm Sound, with Catherine playing only her left hand and Charlotte her right hand in Windsor Castle's Inner Hall. The event, held at Westminster Abbey, focused on celebrating the 'power of love and togetherness,' recognizing contributions to society. Catherine narrated the video, emphasizing that Christmas is about love expressed through simple acts like listening and helping, rather than grand gestures. This aligns with the concert's theme, chosen to address feelings of fragmentation in society. Catherine, who has passed grade three piano and grade five theory, previously played at the 2021 carol service, accompanying singer Tom Walker. Organizers aimed to highlight connections, and Catherine included the duet to underscore the importance of care and compassion in building community ties.",
