  "title": "Why Roadworks Are Everywhere and Causing Delays",
  "summary": "Roadworks are common on roads and motorways, with orange lights and cones slowing down traffic. They happen because many roads were built a long time ago, in the 1960s and 1970s, and now need repairs to stay safe. In England, more roadworks are expected as roads get old. This causes delays for drivers like Brett, who drives big trucks, and people in villages like Clanfield, where roads are closed for utility work. Roadworks cost money and make people frustrated, but they are important to fix old pipes and roads. The article explains that it's a balance between making roads better and dealing with the trouble they cause.",

    "Roads are important for travel, and many were built decades ago. Over time, they wear out and need fixing, which is called roadworks. This involves closing lanes or roads, using cones and lights, and can slow down traffic. Utility companies also dig up roads to replace old pipes. While roadworks can be annoying and costly, they help keep roads safe and working properly. Understanding this helps us see why they happen and how they affect daily life."
