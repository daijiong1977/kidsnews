  "title": "A New Idea About How Magnets Change Electricity",
  "summary": "Scientists have discovered something surprising about how magnets and electricity work together in a field called spintronics. For a long time, people thought that when a magnet is placed next to a metal, it changes how electricity flows because of something called spin Hall magnetoresistance. But now, researchers found that this change happens in many different materials, even when the old idea doesn't fit. Two professors, Lijun Zhu and Xiangrong Wang, did experiments that show the real reason is about how electrons bounce at the surface where the magnet and metal meet. They call this two-vector magnetoresistance. This new idea is simpler and can explain lots of old experiments better. It helps us understand how to make better electronic devices using magnets.",

    "Spintronics is a branch of physics that looks at how the spin of electrons, which is like a tiny magnet inside them, can be used in technology. Magnetoresistance is when the electrical resistance of a material changes when a magnet is nearby. This is important for things like computer memory and sensors. Scientists have been studying this for years to improve electronics."
