  "title": "A New Way to Help Make Babies and Stop Babies",
  "summary": "Scientists at Michigan State University found a special switch in sperm cells that helps them get more energy to swim fast and fertilize an egg. This discovery could help people who have trouble having babies and could lead to a new type of birth control for men that doesn't use hormones. Sperm are tiny cells that need lots of energy to move and do their job. Before they are ready, they stay calm and use little energy. But when they enter a female's body, they wake up and start swimming hard, which needs a big energy boost. The researchers used a method like painting a car pink and watching it with a drone to see how sperm use sugar for fuel. They found an enzyme called aldolase that acts like a switch to turn on this energy. This could help make treatments for infertility and create safe birth control options for men in the future.",

    "Sperm are tiny cells that come from males and are needed to make babies. They swim to find an egg, and when they join, a baby can start to grow. Sometimes, people have infertility, which means it's hard for them to have babies. Birth control is used to prevent babies from being made, and most options are for women. This article talks about a new discovery that could help with both problems by understanding how sperm get energy."
