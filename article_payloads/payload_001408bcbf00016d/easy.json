  "title": "France's Leader Wants Europe to Be Stronger in the World",
  "summary": "French President Emmanuel Macron says Europe needs to act like a big power in the world. He thinks Europe faces threats from countries like China, Russia, and the US, so it's time to wake up and become stronger. Macron wants European countries to work together by sharing debt, which means borrowing money as a group to pay for important things like defense, clean energy, and technology. He believes this will help Europe compete better and protect its industries. Some countries, like Germany, are unsure about this idea because they worry about sharing costs. Macron also says Europe should be fair to its own producers by making rules that apply to everyone. Overall, he is calling for Europe to unite and take more responsibility on the global stage.",
