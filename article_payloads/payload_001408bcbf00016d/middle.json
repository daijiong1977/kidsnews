  "title": "Macron Calls for European Unity and Shared Debt to Boost Global Power",
  "summary": "French President Emmanuel Macron has urged Europe to assert itself as a global power in response to growing threats from China, Russia, and the US. Speaking ahead of an EU summit in Brussels, he emphasized that Europe faces a wake-up call and must become more cohesive in economy, defense, and democratic systems. Macron proposed mutualised loans, or eurobonds, to raise hundreds of billions of euros for investments in security, clean energy, and artificial intelligence. He argued that global financial markets are seeking alternatives to the US dollar and that European debt could attract investors due to Europe's democratic stability. However, this idea has faced skepticism from Germany and other nations, who worry about bearing financial burdens for countries like France that have not implemented sufficient reforms. Macron acknowledged France's economic challenges but highlighted reforms in countries like Portugal and Spain as successful examples. He also called for coherent trade policies to protect European industries without being protectionist, ensuring fair rules for both European and non-European producers. Overall, Macron's vision is for a more integrated and assertive Europe on the world stage.",

    "The European Union (EU) is a political and economic union of 27 European countries that promotes cooperation and integration. French President Emmanuel Macron, as a key EU leader, is advocating for deeper unity to address external pressures from major powers like China, Russia, and the US. His proposal for mutualised debt, similar to eurobonds, aims to fund large-scale projects in critical sectors, building on past debates about fiscal responsibility within the EU. This context involves historical tensions between member states, such as France and Germany, over economic reforms and shared financial risks, reflecting broader challenges in European governance and global competitiveness."
