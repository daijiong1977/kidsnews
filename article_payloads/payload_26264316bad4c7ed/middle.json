  "title": "The Impact of Email Language on Professional Perception",
  "summary": "This article examines how linguistic habits in workplace emails, such as excessive exclamation marks, apologies, and emojis, can subtly undermine an individual's professional image. Experts Hannah Salton, a careers coach, and William Hanson, an etiquette coach, analyze why people, particularly women, adopt these writing styles. Research indicates that women use exclamation marks three times more often than men, often to avoid being perceived as bossy or harsh due to gender biases. While these elements aim to convey positivity and approachability, they may inadvertently signal insecurity or lack of credibility, especially when overused. Emojis, though intended to clarify tone, can be misinterpreted and carry infantile connotations, potentially making the writer seem less senior or capable. The article advises using clear language and good command of English instead, emphasizing that written communication is prone to misreading. It highlights the cumulative effect of these habits on career advancement, suggesting that mindful email writing can enhance how one is perceived and promoted in professional settings.",
