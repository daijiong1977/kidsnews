  "title": "What Happens to UK Companies After US Court Ruling?",
  "summary": "UK companies are unsure what will happen after a US court said no to some taxes called tariffs that President Trump made. The court stopped tariffs from last year, but Trump says he will make new 10% taxes on many countries, including the UK. This means UK businesses might have to pay more money when trading with the US. Experts say it is still unclear for companies. The UK government is trying to talk with the US to lower tariffs, especially on things like steel and cars. Trump is unhappy with the court's decision and promises to bring back the tariffs in another way. This creates confusion for UK firms trying to plan their business.",

    "Tariffs are taxes that countries put on goods from other countries to make them more expensive. This can affect businesses that trade internationally. In this article, the US Supreme Court, which is the highest court in America, made a decision about tariffs set by President Trump. This causes uncertainty for UK companies because they don't know how much they will have to pay in the future. The UK government is negotiating to try to reduce these tariffs and help businesses."
