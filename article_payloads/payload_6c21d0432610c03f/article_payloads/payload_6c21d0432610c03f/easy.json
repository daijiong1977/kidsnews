  "title": "Ariana Grande's Hair Color Change",
  "summary": "Ariana Grande is a famous singer and actress who is playing Glinda the Good Witch in the movie 'Wicked'. She recently changed her hair color from blonde to brown. This change is not because she is saying goodbye to her character Glinda. Instead, it is just a personal choice for her style. Ariana wants people to know that she can have brown hair and still be Glinda. The movie is being made in a studio, and Cynthia Erivo is also in it as Elphaba. This helps us understand that actors can change their looks without leaving their roles.",
