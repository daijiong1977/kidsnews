  "title": "UK's Top Taxpayers: Celebrities and Business Leaders Contribute Billions",
  "summary": "This article reports on The Sunday Times Tax List, which ranks the 100 highest taxpayers in the UK. Topping the list are Fred and Peter Done, brothers who founded the gambling company Betfred, with an estimated £400.1 million tax payment. Other notable entries include celebrities like Harry Styles, who paid £24.7 million, Anthony Joshua with £11 million, and JK Rowling at £47.5 million. Sports figures such as Erling Haaland and Mo Salah also feature, contributing millions in taxes. The total tax paid by the top 100 increased to £5.758 billion from £4.985 billion the previous year, partly due to higher corporation tax rates implemented by the Labour government. The list highlights a diverse group, including business owners, athletes, and artists. However, it also notes that six taxpayers have left the UK recently, possibly to avoid increased taxes and the end of non-dom status, raising concerns about tax avoidance. The compilation by Robert Watts emphasizes the significant role these individuals play in funding public services through their tax contributions.",

    "The UK tax system requires individuals and businesses to pay taxes based on their income and profits. Taxes fund public services like healthcare, education, and infrastructure. The Sunday Times Tax List, compiled annually, highlights the top 100 taxpayers, showcasing contributions from various sectors. Recently, changes such as increased corporation tax rates and the end of non-dom status have impacted tax bills, leading to higher payments for some but also prompting concerns about tax avoidance as wealthy individuals relocate. Understanding this list helps illustrate economic trends, government policies, and the role of high earners in society. It also sparks debates on fairness and the effectiveness of tax measures in addressing public needs."
