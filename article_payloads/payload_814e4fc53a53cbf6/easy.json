  "summary": "This article talks about the 100 biggest taxpayers in the UK. The top taxpayers are two brothers who own a betting company called Betfred. They paid over £400 million in taxes last year. Famous people like Harry Styles, a singer, and Anthony Joshua, a boxer, are also on the list. They paid millions of pounds in taxes too. Other celebrities include JK Rowling, who wrote Harry Potter, and football players like Erling Haaland and Mo Salah. The list shows that all these people together paid over £5 billion in taxes. This helps the government pay for things like schools and hospitals. Some rich people moved away from the UK to avoid paying more taxes. The list was made by a newspaper called The Sunday Times.",

    "Taxes are money that people and businesses pay to the government. In the UK, the government uses taxes to pay for things like schools, hospitals, and roads. Some people pay a lot of taxes because they earn a lot of money from jobs like singing, boxing, or owning companies. A newspaper called The Sunday Times makes a list each year of the 100 people who pay the most taxes. This helps show how much money the government gets from rich people. Sometimes, people move to other countries to pay less tax, which can be a problem for the UK."
