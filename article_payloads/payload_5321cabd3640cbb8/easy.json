  "title": "Brain Cells That Help Heal Spinal Cord Injuries",
  "summary": "Scientists have found special brain cells called astrocytes that help heal spinal cord injuries. These cells are far from the injury site and are called lesion-remote astrocytes. They send signals to immune cells called microglia to clean up debris from the injury. This cleanup helps the body repair itself better. The study was done on mice and human patients, showing it might work in people too. This discovery could lead to new treatments for spinal cord injuries and diseases like multiple sclerosis. Astrocytes are support cells in the brain and spinal cord that keep things working properly. When there is an injury, they help by telling microglia to eat and digest the broken parts, which reduces inflammation and helps healing.",

    "The spinal cord is a long bundle of nerves in your back that helps your brain talk to your body. When it gets hurt, it can cause problems like not being able to move. Scientists study cells in the brain and spinal cord to find ways to help people heal. Astrocytes are helper cells that keep everything working smoothly. In this study, researchers found that some astrocytes far from an injury send signals to immune cells to clean up the mess, which helps the body repair itself. This could mean new medicines for people with spinal cord injuries or diseases like multiple sclerosis."
