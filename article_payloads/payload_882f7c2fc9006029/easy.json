  "title": "Immune Cells That Help Cancer Grow",
  "summary": "Scientists found that some immune cells, called neutrophils, can change and help cancer grow instead of fighting it. Normally, neutrophils protect our bodies from germs and injuries. But in cancer, tumors can make these cells produce a molecule called CCL3. This molecule helps the tumor get bigger. The research was done by scientists at the University of Geneva and the Ludwig Institute for Cancer Research. They studied many types of cancer and saw this happen often. By understanding this, doctors might better track how cancer spreads. The study was published in a journal called Cancer Cell.",

    "Cancer is a disease where cells grow out of control and form lumps called tumors. Our bodies have immune cells like neutrophils that usually fight diseases. Sometimes, in cancer, these cells get confused and start helping the tumor instead. Scientists study this to find new ways to treat cancer and help people get better."
