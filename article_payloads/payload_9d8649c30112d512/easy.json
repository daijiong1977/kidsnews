  "title": "How Diabetes Changes Your Heart",
  "summary": "Scientists in Australia found that type 2 diabetes makes the heart different inside. They looked at heart tissue from people who had diabetes and heart problems. They saw that diabetes changes how the heart makes energy and how the muscle looks. This can make the heart weaker and not pump blood well. Diabetes is a disease where the body has trouble with sugar. Heart disease is a big problem in Australia. This study helps doctors understand why people with diabetes get sicker hearts. It might lead to new treatments to help keep hearts healthy.",

    "Type 2 diabetes is a common disease where the body cannot use sugar properly, leading to high blood sugar. It can cause many health problems, including heart disease, which is when the heart does not work well. The heart is a muscle that pumps blood to give oxygen and nutrients to the body. Scientists study heart tissue to see how diseases like diabetes change it. This research helps find ways to treat people and keep their hearts healthy."
