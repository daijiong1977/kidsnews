  "title": "Nitrogen Limits Reduce Plant CO2 Absorption in Climate Models",
  "summary": "Carbon dioxide (CO2) in the atmosphere drives climate change, but plants can mitigate this by absorbing CO2 through faster growth, a phenomenon known as the CO2 fertilization effect. However, this effect depends on nitrogen availability, as plants require nitrogen for growth and cannot utilize it directly; instead, microorganisms in soil perform nitrogen fixation to convert nitrogen into a usable form. Recent research led by an international team, including Bettina Weber from the University of Graz, reveals that Earth System models have overestimated nitrogen fixation rates in natural ecosystems by about 50%. This overestimation leads to a reduction of approximately 11% in the projected CO2 fertilization effect, meaning plants absorb less CO2 than previously predicted. The study, published in PNAS, emphasizes the need to update climate models to account for accurate nitrogen dynamics, as nitrogen cycle byproducts like nitrous oxide can influence climate processes. This adjustment is crucial for reliable future projections of ecosystem responses and climate trends.",

    "Climate change is exacerbated by high CO2 levels, but plants offer a natural solution by absorbing CO2 through photosynthesis. The CO2 fertilization effect suggests that elevated CO2 can boost plant growth, enhancing carbon sequestration. However, this relies on nitrogen, a key nutrient that plants acquire via nitrogen fixation by soil microbes. Earth System models integrate such processes to forecast climate impacts, but recent studies indicate these models have inaccurately estimated nitrogen fixation rates in natural settings. An international research team, including experts from the University of Graz and Simon Fraser University, conducted analyses showing a significant overestimation, leading to revised projections for CO2 absorption. This highlights the importance of refining models to include precise nitrogen cycle data, as inaccuracies can affect predictions of global warming and ecosystem health."
