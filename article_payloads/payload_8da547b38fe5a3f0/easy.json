  "title": "Plants Can't Soak Up as Much CO2 as We Thought",
  "summary": "Plants help fight climate change by absorbing carbon dioxide (CO2) from the air, which can make them grow faster. But scientists have found that plants need a nutrient called nitrogen to grow well, and they can't use nitrogen on their own. Tiny microbes in the soil help turn nitrogen into a form plants can use, but this process happens less in nature than we believed. A new study shows that climate models, which predict how much CO2 plants can absorb, have overestimated this by about 11%. This means plants might not slow down warming as much as we hoped. Researchers say it's important to update these models to make better predictions about our planet's future.",

    "Climate change is caused by too much carbon dioxide in the air, which traps heat. Plants can help by absorbing CO2 as they grow, but they need nutrients like nitrogen. Nitrogen fixation is a process where microbes in soil make nitrogen usable for plants. Scientists use climate models to predict how much CO2 plants can absorb, but new research shows these models were wrong because they overestimated how much nitrogen is available in nature. This means we need to adjust our expectations about how much plants can help slow down warming."
