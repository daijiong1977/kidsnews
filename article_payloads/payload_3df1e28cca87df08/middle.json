  "title": "Mosasaurs Adapted to River Life Before Extinction",
  "summary": "Researchers discovered a mosasaur tooth in North Dakota's river deposits, dating back about 66 million years ago, which challenges the belief that these giant marine reptiles lived exclusively in oceans. The tooth, found alongside a Tyrannosaurus rex tooth and a crocodylian jawbone, prompted an international team led by Uppsala University to investigate. Using isotope analysis on the tooth enamel, scientists measured oxygen, strontium, and carbon isotopes. Results showed high levels of lighter oxygen isotopes and specific strontium ratios, indicating a freshwater river environment rather than a marine one. Carbon isotopes suggested the mosasaur did not dive deep and may have fed on drowned dinosaurs. Additional teeth from nearby sites supported these findings, revealing that mosasaurs inhabited riverine systems in the final million years before their extinction. The study explains that the Western Interior Seaway, an ancient inland sea, gradually turned brackish and then freshwater due to increased freshwater input, creating a halocline where lung-breathing mosasaurs could live in the upper freshwater layer. This adaptation is simpler than moving from freshwater to marine habitats, as seen in modern animals like river dolphins and estuarine crocodiles.",

    "Mosasaurs were large marine reptiles that thrived during the Late Cretaceous period, over 66 million years ago, and are often studied as key predators of ancient oceans. The Western Interior Seaway was a major body of water that split North America, influencing climate and ecosystems. Isotope analysis is a common technique in paleontology to reconstruct past environments by examining chemical signatures in fossils. This discovery highlights how environmental changes, such as the seaway turning freshwater, can drive habitat shifts in species, similar to evolutionary patterns seen in modern animals like crocodiles and dolphins. Understanding these adaptations helps scientists predict how current species might respond to climate change."

    "Main Points: The article reveals that mosasaurs, previously thought to be exclusively marine, adapted to freshwater rivers in their final million years, based on isotope analysis of teeth found in North Dakota. Purpose: To challenge existing knowledge about mosasaur habitats and explain how environmental changes facilitated this adaptation. Evidence Evaluation: Strong evidence from chemical isotopes in multiple teeth supports freshwater habitation, though limited sample size may affect generalizability. Author Credibility: Researchers from Uppsala University and international teams with expertise in paleontology and isotope geochemistry. Methodology: Isotope analysis of oxygen, strontium, and carbon in tooth enamel, comparing with other fossils to infer habitat and diet."
