  "title": "Isotopic Evidence Reveals Mosasaur Freshwater Adaptation in Late Cretaceous Rivers",
  "summary": "A groundbreaking study led by Uppsala University researchers presents isotopic evidence that mosasaurs, large marine reptiles from the Late Cretaceous, inhabited freshwater river systems approximately 66 million years ago, challenging long-held assumptions about their exclusively marine ecology. The discovery centers on a mosasaur tooth excavated from river deposits in North Dakota, found in association with a Tyrannosaurus rex tooth and a crocodylian jawbone, indicating a mixed terrestrial and aquatic paleoenvironment. Through advanced isotope analysis conducted at Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam, scientists examined oxygen, strontium, and carbon isotopes in the tooth enamel. Results demonstrated elevated levels of the lighter oxygen isotope (16O) and distinctive strontium ratios, unequivocally pointing to a freshwater habitat rather than a marine one. Carbon isotope data further suggested that this mosasaur did not engage in deep diving and potentially fed on drowned dinosaurs, as indicated by higher 13C values compared to other contemporaneous fauna. Analysis of additional mosasaur teeth from proximate sites corroborated these findings, establishing that riverine habitation occurred during the final million years prior to extinction. The research contextualizes this adaptation within the gradual transformation of the Western Interior Seaway from saline to brackish and ultimately freshwater, driven by increased freshwater influx, which created a halocline—a stratification allowing lung-breathing mosasaurs to occupy the upper freshwater layer while gill-breathing organisms remained in saline depths. This study elucidates the comparative simplicity of marine-to-freshwater transitions in evolutionary history, drawing parallels to modern analogs such as river dolphins and estuarine crocodiles, and underscores the dynamic interplay between environmental change and phenotypic plasticity in prehistoric megafauna.",

    "Mosasaurs were apex marine predators during the Late Cretaceous, belonging to the squamate reptiles and exhibiting significant morphological diversity. The Western Interior Seaway was a key paleogeographic feature influencing North American climate and biodiversity, with its salinity fluctuations driven by tectonic and hydrological processes. Isotope geochemistry is a fundamental tool in paleontology for reconstructing past climates, diets, and habitats through analysis of stable isotopes in biogenic apatite. This study integrates multidisciplinary approaches, including stratigraphy and geochemistry, to elucidate niche partitioning and adaptive strategies. The findings resonate with contemporary ecological theories on habitat shifts and phenotypic plasticity, offering a framework for assessing how extant species might respond to anthropogenic environmental changes, such as salinity alterations due to climate change."
