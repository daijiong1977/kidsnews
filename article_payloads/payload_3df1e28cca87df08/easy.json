  "title": "Giant Sea Monsters Lived in Rivers Long Ago",
  "summary": "Scientists found a big tooth from a mosasaur, a giant sea monster that lived over 66 million years ago with dinosaurs. The tooth was discovered in North Dakota in a river, not in the ocean. This shows that some mosasaurs lived in rivers near the end of their time on Earth. The tooth was found with a T. rex tooth and a crocodile bone, which is unusual because mosasaurs were thought to only live in the sea. Researchers used special tests on the tooth to learn about its chemistry. They found signs that it came from a freshwater river, meaning the mosasaur adapted to live there. This helps us understand how animals can change their homes when their environment changes, like modern river dolphins do today.",

    "Mosasaurs were large marine reptiles that lived during the time of dinosaurs, over 66 million years ago. They are often called sea monsters because they could grow very big, up to 11 meters long. Scientists used to think they only lived in oceans, but new discoveries show they adapted to rivers too. This helps us learn how animals can change their habitats when their environment changes, similar to how some animals today move between different types of water."
