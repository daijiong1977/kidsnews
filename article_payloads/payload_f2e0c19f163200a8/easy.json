  "title": "Scientists Use New Tool to Turn Genes On Without Cutting DNA",
  "summary": "Scientists have made a new tool that can turn genes on without cutting DNA, making gene therapy safer. Genes are like instructions in our bodies that tell cells what to do. Sometimes, genes get turned off by tiny chemical tags called methyl groups. This new tool, based on CRISPR technology, removes these tags to turn genes back on. It works like brushing cobwebs off a light switch to make it work again. This could help treat diseases like Sickle Cell Disease without the risks of cutting DNA, which can cause cancer. The research was done by scientists at UNSW Sydney and St Jude Children's Research Hospital, and it shows that methyl groups are not just harmless byproducts but actively control genes. This breakthrough could lead to safer treatments for many genetic diseases.",

    "Genes are like tiny instructions inside every cell of our bodies that tell the cell how to work. Sometimes, these instructions get turned off, which can cause diseases. Scientists use tools like CRISPR to fix genes, but older tools cut DNA, which can be risky. This new tool is safer because it doesn't cut DNA; instead, it removes chemical tags called methyl groups that turn genes off. This could help people with genetic diseases like Sickle Cell Disease, where red blood cells don't work properly, by turning on helpful genes without dangerous side effects."
