  "title": "A Singer's 50-Year Quest to Reconnect with His Biological Father",
  "summary": "Peter Cunnah, the lead singer of the 1990s band D:Ream, known for the hit 'Things Can Only Get Better,' embarked on a lifelong personal journey to find his birth parents. Adopted as an infant in Belfast and raised by Les and Monica Cunnah in Londonderry, he was told about his adoption at a young age by his adoptive mother, which he processed over time. While achieving fame in the 1990s, including chart success and the song's use as a political anthem, Peter faced personal struggles with addiction. Despite these challenges, he persisted in searching for his biological family. After over 50 years, he located his birth father, Patrick Hanna, in Barnsley, Yorkshire, and had an emotional reunion. He discovered that his father is a touring musician and that he has half-siblings involved in music, such as Philippa Hanna and Stuart Zender. This story highlights themes of identity, resilience, and the impact of adoption on personal growth, showing how Peter's musical talent may have familial roots.",
