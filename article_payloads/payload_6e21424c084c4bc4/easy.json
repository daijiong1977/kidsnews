  "title": "Venezuela Says Sorry to Political Prisoners",
  "summary": "Venezuela's government has approved a new law to free hundreds of people who were put in jail for political reasons. This is a big change because for many years, the government said it did not have any political prisoners. The law will help politicians, activists, lawyers, and others who were targeted by the ruling party. It was proposed by Acting President Delcy Rodríguez and is expected to be signed soon. During a debate, an opposition lawmaker said it is not perfect but will reduce suffering. The law covers crimes from specific periods since 1999, including during the 2024 election protests. Some lawmakers disagreed last week about whether people who left the country could get amnesty, but they solved it by letting lawyers apply for them. A prisoners' rights group says over 600 people are in custody for political reasons. After former President Nicolás Maduro was captured, the government promised to release prisoners, but critics say it is happening too slowly.",
