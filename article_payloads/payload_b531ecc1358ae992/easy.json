  "title": "Neanderthals Made Fire Long Ago",
  "summary": "A long time ago, Neanderthals, who were early people, learned to start fires. Archaeologists found evidence in England at a place called Barnham. They discovered red clay, cracked stones, and a shiny mineral called pyrite. These things show that Neanderthals built campfires about 400,000 years ago. They used flint and pyrite to make sparks and light the fire. This is the oldest proof that people could create and control fire. Fire helped them cook food, stay warm, and gather together at night. It was an important step that helped humans develop over time. The site was near a pond with trees and grass, making it a good spot for a camp. Scientists think fire allowed Neanderthals to socialize and tell stories, just like we do today.",

    "Neanderthals were early humans who lived in Europe and Asia long before modern humans. They used simple tools and lived in groups. Fire was a big discovery because it provided light, heat, and protection. Archaeologists study old sites to learn about how people lived in the past. The Barnham site in England is special because it shows evidence of controlled fire from a very long time ago. Understanding this helps us see how early humans developed skills that are still important today."
