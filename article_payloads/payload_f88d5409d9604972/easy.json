    "Immigration is when people move to a new country to live. In the U.S., ICE is a group that enforces immigration laws. Sometimes, ICE takes actions that some people think are unfair or harmful. Cardinal Tobin is a religious leader who uses his faith to guide his opinions. He is asking others to help change how ICE is funded because he believes it is not acting properly. This is part of a bigger discussion about how to treat immigrants kindly and follow rules."
