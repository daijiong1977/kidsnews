    "Immigration enforcement in the U.S. involves agencies like ICE (Immigration and Customs Enforcement), which handle border control and deportations. Under the Trump administration, policies such as family separations and increased detentions sparked controversy. Cardinal Tobin, as a religious leader, draws on Catholic social teaching, which emphasizes human dignity and the rights of migrants. His call to defund ICE is part of a larger debate over immigration reform, where some advocate for stricter enforcement while others push for more compassionate approaches. Understanding this context helps explain why Cardinal Tobin is taking a stand and urging political action based on ethical principles."
