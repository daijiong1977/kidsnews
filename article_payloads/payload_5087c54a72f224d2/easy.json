  "title": "President Trump Wants Greenland and Europe Says No",
  "summary": "President Trump wants the United States to buy Greenland, which is a big island owned by Denmark. He is telling European countries that if they don't let the U.S. have Greenland, he will make them pay extra taxes on things they sell to America. European leaders are meeting to decide what to do. They are sending more soldiers to Greenland to protect it and say they support Greenland staying with Denmark. President Trump is upset because he didn't win the Nobel Peace Prize, so he says he might not use only peaceful ways to get Greenland. This is causing a big argument between the U.S. and Europe.",

The Nobel Peace Prize is given to people who work for peace, and not winning it can make leaders angry. This article shows how leaders make decisions that affect many people."
