  "title": "Unveiling Orkney's Archaeological Mystery",
  "summary": "Archaeologists have announced an extraordinary discovery at the Ness of Brodgar in Orkney, made possible through advanced 3D Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR) technology. This site, a key Neolithic location in the British Isles, has been under excavation for over 20 years, revealing numerous structures from 3,500 BC to 2,400 BC. The new find is described as totally dissimilar to anything previously uncovered and may not even date back to the Neolithic era, suggesting it could be from a later period. The team, led by archaeologist Nick Card, is withholding details until further excavations resume, funded by Time Team for a future programme. They believe this discovery could rewrite aspects of the site's history, as it lies in an area with little deep archaeology, indicating it might not lead to prolonged digs. The Ness of Brodgar is renowned for its rectangular forms and art, and its proximity to the Ring of Brodgar stone circle highlights its significance in European prehistory.",
