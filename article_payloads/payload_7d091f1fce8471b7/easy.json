  "title": "Mystery Discovery in Orkney",
  "summary": "Archaeologists in Orkney have made an amazing discovery using special radar technology at a place called the Ness of Brodgar. They found something totally new and different from anything else ever uncovered there. The team is keeping it a secret for now until they do more digging. This site is very old, from the Neolithic times, and has many ancient buildings. The discovery might not even be from the Neolithic period, which makes it even more exciting. Archaeologists think it could add a new chapter to history. They will start digging again soon to learn more about this mysterious find.",
