  "title": "Wall Street Goes Up After Fed Lowers Interest Rates",
  "summary": "The U.S. stock market went up on Wednesday after the Federal Reserve, which is like the country's money boss, cut interest rates. This means it costs less to borrow money, which can help the economy and make stocks more valuable. The S&P 500, Dow Jones, and Nasdaq indexes all rose a little bit. People on Wall Street, where stocks are traded, were happy because they expected this rate cut. The Fed cut rates by a small amount to support jobs, but some officials disagreed on whether to cut more or not. The article also mentions that companies like GE Vernova and Palantir Technologies saw their stock prices go up due to good news. The big question is how many more rate cuts might happen next year to help the job market.",

The job market refers to how many people are employed and looking for work. This article talks about how these things are connected and affect each other."
