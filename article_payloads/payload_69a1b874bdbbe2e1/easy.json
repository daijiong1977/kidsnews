  "title": "A Judge Changes a Voting Map in New York City",
  "summary": "A judge in New York said the voting map for a special area in New York City is not fair. This area is the only one in the city where a Republican politician wins. The judge thinks the map makes it hard for Black and Hispanic people to have their votes count. So, the judge wants a group to draw a new map by February 6. Republicans are upset and might ask a higher court to change this decision. They say it helps Democrats win more seats. This is part of a big fight across the country about how voting maps are made. The area is in Brooklyn and Staten Island, and some people want to add parts of Manhattan to make it more fair.",

    "In the United States, voting maps decide who people can vote for in elections. Sometimes, these maps are drawn in ways that are not fair to certain groups, like Black or Hispanic people. This is called gerrymandering. Judges can step in to fix unfair maps. New York City has many areas, and one is represented by a Republican, which is rare there. People are arguing about how to make maps fair for everyone."
