  "title": "Senate Says No to Health Care Plans",
  "summary": "The U.S. Senate did not pass two health care bills today. These bills were meant to help people pay for health insurance. Without the bills, tax credits from the Affordable Care Act will end soon. This means health insurance costs could go up for many Americans next month. Republicans and Democrats each had a plan, but neither got enough votes to pass. The Senate needs 60 votes to pass a bill, but both plans only got 51 votes. Now, lawmakers are going on break without an agreement, leaving millions of people unsure about their health care. This shows that the two parties cannot agree on how to fix the problem.",

    "The U.S. government has a group called the Senate that makes laws. Health care is about helping people stay healthy and pay for doctor visits. The Affordable Care Act, also called Obamacare, is a law from 2010 that helps Americans buy health insurance. Tax credits are like discounts from the government to make insurance cheaper. Republicans and Democrats are the two big groups in politics who often disagree on how to run things. When they can't agree, laws don't get passed, which can affect many people."
