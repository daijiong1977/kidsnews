  "title": "Pensioners Won't Pay Tax on Their Only Income",
  "summary": "The government has announced that people who only get money from the state pension will not have to pay tax on it until 2030. The state pension is a payment from the government for older people who have retired. Right now, the amount is just below the level where tax starts, but it will go up in 2027. This means that if pensioners have no other income, they won't face the hassle of tax forms and payments. However, most pensioners have extra money from other pensions, so they already pay tax. This new rule helps those with only the state pension, but it might make the tax system more complicated. The chancellor, Rachel Reeves, made this promise to protect the poorest pensioners from extra costs.",

    "The state pension is a regular payment from the government to people who have reached retirement age. It helps them live without working. Income tax is money taken from what people earn to pay for public services like schools and hospitals. In the UK, you only pay tax if your income is above a certain amount, called the threshold. This article talks about a new rule to stop taxing pensioners who have no other money, making things easier for them."
