  "title": "Hospital Waiting Times: Challenges and Progress in England",
  "summary": "This article examines the state of hospital waiting times in England, revealing that nearly a quarter of hospitals have seen worsening waits since the government's plan to address the backlog was introduced a year ago. BBC analysis shows that out of 129 hospital trusts, 31 have regressed and 17 have made minimal progress, despite national efforts to improve. Key treatments affected include knee and hip operations, with the government aiming to hit an 18-week waiting target by March 2029, a goal unmet since 2015. Hospitals cite multiple challenges such as staffing shortages, doctor strikes, and IT system issues as barriers to improvement. The article highlights the personal story of Mary Waterhouse, a 72-year-old arthritis patient from Blackpool, who faced an eight-month wait for assessment, leading to deteriorated health and a decision to forgo multiple surgeries due to advanced arthritis. Her experience underscores the broader issue of inequitable access to timely care, as noted by Arthritis UK. While the government prioritizes reducing waits and sets interim targets, the analysis suggests persistent struggles in many trusts, emphasizing the need for sustained action to ensure patients receive prompt treatment.",
