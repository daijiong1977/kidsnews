  "title": "Hospitals with Longer Waits: A Simple Look",
  "summary": "This article talks about hospitals in England where patients are waiting longer for treatments like knee and hip operations. About one-quarter of hospitals have seen waiting times get worse over the past year, even though the government has a plan to fix this. Some hospitals are struggling because they don't have enough staff, doctors are on strike, or their computer systems have problems. The story shares the experience of Mary, a 72-year-old woman with arthritis who had to wait eight months for an assessment. By the time she was seen, her health had gotten so bad that she needed many surgeries, but she decided not to have them because it was too much. She now uses a mobility scooter and lives with pain. Experts say quick treatment can help people a lot, but not everyone gets it equally. The government wants to make waits shorter by 2029, but it's a big challenge.",
