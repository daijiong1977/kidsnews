  "title": "A Tiny Light Trap for Super-Fast Computers",
  "summary": "Scientists at Stanford University have made a big discovery to help build super-fast computers called quantum computers. These computers use tiny particles called atoms to store information as qubits, which are like special zeros and ones. The problem is that atoms don't send out light quickly or in one direction, making it hard to read the information. The team created a new tool called an optical cavity, which is like a tiny trap for light. It captures light from each atom and guides it so we can read all the qubits at once. They tested this with 40 cavities and a bigger one with over 500, showing it could lead to computers with a million qubits. This could make computers much faster, solving problems in hours instead of thousands of years.",

    "Quantum computers are a new type of computer that use tiny particles like atoms to work much faster than regular computers. They use qubits, which are special because they can be zero, one, or both at the same time, helping solve hard problems quickly. Scientists at Stanford University are trying to build these computers, but they need to read information from atoms faster. They made a tool called an optical cavity to trap light from each atom, making it easier to collect data. This could lead to computers with millions of qubits, making them super powerful for things like science and medicine."
