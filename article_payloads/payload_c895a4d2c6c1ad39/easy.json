  "title": "How Gut Problems Can Lead to Colon Cancer",
  "summary": "Scientists have found out why people with a gut disease called IBD get colon cancer more often. IBD makes the gut swollen and sore for a long time. In the study, they looked at a protein called TL1A that is linked to IBD and cancer. This protein tells special immune cells in the gut, called ILC3s, to send signals to the bone marrow. The bone marrow then makes lots of white blood cells called neutrophils. These neutrophils travel to the gut and help tumors grow by damaging cells. The research shows how this chain reaction happens and suggests new ways to stop cancer in people with IBD. They hope this can lead to better treatments and earlier detection.",

    "IBD is a disease where the gut gets swollen and sore for a long time, and it includes Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. People with IBD have a higher chance of getting colon cancer. Scientists are studying how this happens to help prevent cancer. In this article, they found a protein and cells that work together to make tumors grow. Understanding this can lead to better treatments for people with IBD."
