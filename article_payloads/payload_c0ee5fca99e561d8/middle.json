  "title": "Armed Robber Targets Actress Anya Taylor-Joy in London Break-In",
  "summary": "In February 2023, Kirk Holdrick, a 43-year-old career criminal, participated in a burglary at a London mansion where actress Anya Taylor-Joy and her husband, Malcolm McRae, were staying. Holdrick and an accomplice smashed a side window to enter the property, prompting the couple to barricade themselves in a bedroom. The intruders attempted to prise open the bedroom door, but McRae confronted them, bluffing that he had a gun and causing them to flee empty-handed. Prosecutors suggested this might have been a targeted raid on the celebrities. Holdrick, who has a long criminal history, was later arrested and pleaded guilty to burglary. Additionally, he was involved in a separate home invasion in Dorset where a mother and daughter were threatened with violence, for which he received a 12-year sentence. The London incident left Taylor-Joy and McRae traumatized, fearing future targeting. This case highlights issues of celebrity security and the consequences of repeat offenses.",
