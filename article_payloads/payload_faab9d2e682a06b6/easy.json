  "title": "Gucci Uses AI for Fashion Show Pictures",
  "summary": "Gucci, a famous fashion company, is getting criticized for using AI to make pictures for its fashion show in Milan. People on social media are upset because they think Gucci should use real human models and photographers instead of AI. They call the AI pictures 'AI slop,' which means low-quality AI images. Some people wonder why a big fashion brand like Gucci needs to save money by using AI. Gucci has used AI before in its ads, and other fashion brands are trying AI too. An expert says using AI can be risky because it might give the brand bad publicity instead of good. But not everyone is mad; some think the pictures look glamorous and stylish.",
