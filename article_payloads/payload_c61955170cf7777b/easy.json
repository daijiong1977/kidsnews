  "title": "Big Ancient Holes Found Near Stonehenge",
  "summary": "Scientists have found huge, old holes near Stonehenge in England. These pits are very big, about ten meters wide and five meters deep, and they form a circle. They were made by people over 4,000 years ago, which is a long time before cars or phones existed. Experts think it was a special place for ancient people to show their beliefs and ways of counting. They dug these holes in the chalk ground, which was hard work. The pits are not visible today, but scientists used special tools to study them and found animal bones like sheep and cows. This discovery helps us learn more about how people lived long ago and their big structures.",

    "Stonehenge is a famous ancient monument in England made of big stones in a circle. It was built by people thousands of years ago, and experts think it was used for ceremonies or to track the sun and stars. The new pits found nearby are from the same time and show that ancient people were very smart and built big things to express their ideas about the world. Learning about this helps us understand history and how humans have always been curious."
