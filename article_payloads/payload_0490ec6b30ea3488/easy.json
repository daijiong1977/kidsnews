  "title": "Giant Kangaroos Could Hop Like Today's Kangaroos",
  "summary": "Scientists have discovered that giant kangaroos from long ago might have been able to hop, even though they were very big. These ancient kangaroos lived millions of years ago and weighed as much as 250 kilograms, which is like a big bear. Before, people thought kangaroos that heavy couldn't hop because their ankles would break. But new research shows their leg bones were strong enough for hopping in short bursts. The scientists looked at bones from modern kangaroos and fossils from giant kangaroos to see how they moved. They found that the foot bones and heel bones of giant kangaroos could handle the stress of hopping. However, hopping was probably not their main way to move because they were too big to hop far distances. Instead, they might have hopped quickly to escape predators like marsupial lions. This helps us understand how these amazing animals lived in the past.",

    "Giant kangaroos were ancient animals that lived during the Pleistocene time, millions of years ago. They were much bigger than today's kangaroos and are now extinct. Scientists study fossils, which are their old bones, to learn how they lived and moved. Hopping is a special way kangaroos move by jumping on their strong back legs. This research helps us understand animal evolution and how big animals adapted to their environment."
