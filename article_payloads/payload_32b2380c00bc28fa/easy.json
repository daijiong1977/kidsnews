  "summary": "Astronomers using the Hubble Space Telescope found a special cloud in space called Cloud-9. It is made of gas and dark matter, which is a mysterious material that we cannot see because it does not give off light. Cloud-9 has no stars at all, which makes it very unusual. Scientists think it is like a failed galaxy that never grew stars. This discovery helps us learn about the early Universe and how galaxies form. Cloud-9 is small and round, and it is located near our Milky Way galaxy. By studying it, astronomers can understand more about dark matter and hidden parts of space.",

    "Space is full of many things like stars, planets, and clouds of gas. Astronomers use telescopes to look at these objects and learn about the Universe. Dark matter is a special kind of material that we cannot see directly, but it is very important because it helps hold galaxies together. Cloud-9 is a new discovery that shows a cloud with dark matter but no stars, which is like a piece of the early Universe that never grew up into a full galaxy. This helps scientists understand how galaxies form and what the Universe was like long ago."
