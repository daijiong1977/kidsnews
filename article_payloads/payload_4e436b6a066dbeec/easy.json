  "title": "Doctors Go on Strike in England for Five Days",
  "summary": "Doctors in England are on strike for five days, which means they are not working to ask for better pay and more training jobs. NHS bosses, who run hospitals, say this strike will cause problems for patients because many services might be slowed down or stopped. At the same time, a flu wave is making hospitals very busy. The doctors' union, called the BMA, wants the government to promise higher pay and more training places. The government and union talked but did not agree, so the strike started. Senior doctors are helping to cover some work, but non-urgent care like hip replacements could be affected. This is the 14th strike by these doctors in a long argument over pay.",

    "In England, doctors work for the NHS, which is a public health system. Sometimes, doctors go on strike, which means they stop working to ask for things like better pay or more training. A strike can make it hard for patients to get care, especially if hospitals are already busy with sick people. Unions help doctors talk to the government about their needs. This strike is happening because doctors and the government have not agreed on pay for a long time."
