  "title": "Actor Gets Special Award and Shares It with Others",
  "summary": "Sally Lindsay, who used to be on a TV show called Coronation Street, got a special award called an MBE from the King. She is 52 years old and is famous for playing a character named Shelley. She said she is very happy and wants to give the award to working class actors. Working class people are those who might not have a lot of money or come from rich families. Only 8% of actors are working class, and Sally hopes more will join in the future. She also helps a charity for sick children. Other people got awards too, like a 101-year-old veteran named Bernard Morgan for volunteering and a council leader named Bev Craig for her work in Manchester. The article talks about how these people are being honored for doing good things.",
