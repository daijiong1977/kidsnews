  "title": "A Super Valuable Comic Book",
  "summary": "A very old comic book from 1938, called Action Comics No 1, was sold for $15 million. This comic introduced Superman to the world. It used to belong to the famous actor Nicolas Cage. In 2000, it was stolen from his home during a party. The comic was missing for 11 years until it was found in a storage unit in California in 2011. After it was returned, Cage sold it for $2.2 million. Now, an anonymous collector bought it for much more money. This comic is very rare, with fewer than 100 copies left. It helped create the superhero stories we love today.",
