  "title": "The $15 Million Superman Comic: A Tale of Theft and Value",
  "summary": "A rare copy of Action Comics No 1, the 1938 comic that debuted Superman, sold for $15 million to an anonymous collector in a private sale. This comic, once owned by actor Nicolas Cage, was stolen from his home in 2000 and recovered in 2011 from a California storage unit. After its return, Cage sold it for $2.2 million, and its value has since skyrocketed due to its rarity and storied history. Fewer than 100 copies are believed to exist, making it a key artifact in defining the superhero genre. The sale was brokered by Metropolis Collectibles/Comic Connect in New York, with the comic graded 9 out of 10 by the Certified Guaranty Company, indicating high quality. This sale surpasses the previous record of $9.12 million for a Superman No 1 comic, highlighting the growing market for collectibles. The comic's association with Cage and its theft-recovery story have inflated its value, similar to how the Mona Lisa's theft in 1911 boosted its fame.",
