  "title": "Julia Donaldson Unveils Third Gruffalo Book: Gruffalo Granny",
  "summary": "Children's author Julia Donaldson has revealed the title and main character for her upcoming third Gruffalo book, titled Gruffalo Granny. Scheduled for release on September 10th in hardback and audio book formats, this sequel has been in development for twenty years. The book introduces a new family member, the Gruffalo's granny, while featuring returning characters from the previous installments, promising an exciting new adventure. Donaldson announced this on BBC Radio 4's Today programme, explaining that writing a sequel posed a challenge, and she had the idea for decades but was occupied with other projects. Her personal experience as a granny recently motivated her to finalize the story. Illustrator Axel Scheffler expressed surprise and enthusiasm, having previously doubted another sequel. The Gruffalo series, which began in 1999 with The Gruffalo and continued with The Gruffalo's Child in 2004, consists of rhyming tales set in a woodland with animal characters. These books have achieved global success, selling over 18 million copies in 115 languages. Donaldson credited the National Literacy Trust's use of the earlier books in their Early Words Matter programme as inspiration to develop her long-held idea into a complete narrative.",
