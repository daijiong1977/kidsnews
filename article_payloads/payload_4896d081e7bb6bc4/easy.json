  "title": "A New Gruffalo Book is Coming!",
  "summary": "Julia Donaldson, a famous children's author, has announced a new Gruffalo book called Gruffalo Granny. This is the third book in the series about the Gruffalo monster and his friends. The book will be released on September 10th in hardback and audio book. It took twenty years to make, and it introduces a new character, the Gruffalo's granny, while bringing back old favorites from the first two books. The author shared this news on BBC Radio 4 and said it was a challenge to write a sequel. She got the idea a long time ago but was busy with other books. Now that she is a granny herself, she felt inspired to finish it. The illustrator, Axel Scheffler, was surprised but excited to work on it. The Gruffalo books are very popular, selling over 18 million copies worldwide in many languages. They tell rhyming stories about adventures in a woodland with animals.",
