  "title": "Space Explosions That Don't Leave Craters",
  "summary": "Scientists are studying special explosions from space called touchdown airbursts. These happen when objects like comets explode in the sky above Earth instead of hitting the ground. They don't make big holes like craters, but they can still cause a lot of damage with heat and shockwaves. Professor James Kennett and his team found evidence of these explosions in different places, including deep ocean mud and an old desert city. They found things like rare elements, melted glass, tiny round particles, and cracked rocks that show extreme heat. One big event might have happened about 12,800 years ago, causing global cooling and fires. This helped scientists learn more about how space events affect Earth without leaving craters.",

    "Touchdown airbursts are explosions from space objects like comets that happen high in the sky. Unlike big space rocks that hit the ground and make craters, these explosions don't leave lasting holes, but they can still be very powerful. Scientists study them by looking for special signs in places like ocean mud or old cities. These signs include melted materials and rare elements from space. Learning about airbursts helps us understand how space events can affect Earth's climate and history, even without visible craters."
