  "title": "The Archers Celebrates 75 Years with a Special Show",
  "summary": "The Archers is a radio show that started in 1951 and is now 75 years old. To celebrate, the actors recreated the first scene from the very first episode because the original recording was lost. This special event was part of a day of fun programs on Radio 4. The show is recorded in Birmingham and is the longest-running radio soap opera in the world. Even though it's old, many young people like it too. A 45-minute special called The Archers: Truth and Lies will play on New Year's Day, and a new podcast will air. The actors played characters like Dan and Doris Archer in the recreated scene, which you can watch online or listen to on social media. The editor said the show has timeless appeal and attracts new listeners, making it special for everyone.",
