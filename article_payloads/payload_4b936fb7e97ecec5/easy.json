  "title": "Astronomers Use Radio Waves to See a Star Before It Explodes",
  "summary": "Astronomers have found a new way to learn about stars before they explode. They used a big radio telescope to listen to radio waves from a special exploding star called a Type Ibn supernova. These radio waves showed that the star was losing gas in its last few years before it blew up. The scientists think the star had a friend star nearby, and they danced together, which made the star lose gas faster. This discovery helps us understand how stars die and gives us a time machine to see what happens before they explode. It's like using a new tool to solve a space mystery!",

    "Stars are big balls of gas in space that can explode when they get old. When a star explodes, it's called a supernova, and it can be very bright. Scientists use telescopes to watch these explosions. Radio telescopes listen to radio waves, which are like invisible sounds from space. This helps them learn more about stars before they blow up, like how they lose gas or have star friends nearby."
