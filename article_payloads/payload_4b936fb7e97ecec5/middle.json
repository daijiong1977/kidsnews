  "title": "Radio Waves Uncover Pre-Supernova Activity in Massive Stars",
  "summary": "Astronomers have achieved a breakthrough by detecting radio waves from a Type Ibn supernova, offering unprecedented insights into the final years of massive stars before they explode. Using the Very Large Array radio telescope in New Mexico, the research team tracked faint radio emissions for 18 months, revealing that the star expelled significant amounts of helium-rich gas just a few years prior to the supernova. Lead author Raphael Baer-Way described this as a 'time machine' that allows scientists to observe the intense mass loss in the star's last decade, particularly the final five years. The findings suggest the star was part of a binary system, where gravitational interactions with a companion star likely drove the extreme mass shedding. This radio-based approach complements traditional optical methods, providing hidden details about stellar death and opening new avenues for studying supernovae across the universe. Future research aims to investigate how common such mass-loss events are and what they reveal about stellar evolution.",

    "Supernovae are explosive deaths of massive stars, releasing immense energy and shaping galaxies. Type Ibn supernovae are rare, involving helium-rich outflows before explosion. Astronomers use various telescopes: optical for visible light and radio for detecting radio waves from gas interactions. The Very Large Array is a key radio telescope that helps study such events. Binary star systems can influence stellar evolution through gravitational pulls, leading to phenomena like mass loss. This research advances our understanding of how stars die and the tools needed to observe these processes."
