  "title": "Balloons Can Hurt Animals and Nature",
  "summary": "This article talks about why releasing balloons into the sky is not good for the environment. A balloon seller named Naomi Spittles says she won't sell balloons to people who want to release them because balloons can fall back down and harm animals and nature. She wants balloon releases to be banned. Many local areas in the UK have already made balloon releases illegal. People often release balloons to celebrate or remember someone, but they might not know the danger. Balloons can end up in the ocean or on land, where animals like birds and sea creatures might eat them or get tangled in the strings, which can hurt or kill them. Experts from groups like the Marine Conservation Society and RSPCA explain that balloon litter is increasing and can cause slow deaths to wildlife. Instead of releasing balloons, people can plant trees or flowers as a safer way to remember loved ones.",

    "Balloons are often used for fun at parties or to remember people who have passed away. When released, they float up but eventually come down as trash. This trash can hurt animals by making them sick if eaten or getting them stuck. Many places are making rules to stop balloon releases to protect nature. People can choose other ways to celebrate that don't harm the environment."
