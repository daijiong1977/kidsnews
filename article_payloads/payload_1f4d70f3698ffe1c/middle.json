    "Horror cinema has a long history, often criticized for stereotypical portrayals of women, such as in slasher films from the late 1990s and early 2000s like Scream, where female characters were frequently depicted as victims.

This article discusses this evolution, connecting it to broader societal changes and the growing demand for inclusive storytelling in media. Understanding this context helps appreciate how franchises can adapt to reflect audience diversity and promote positive representation in genres like horror."
