  "title": "How a Zombie Movie Changed Horror for Girls",
  "summary": "A long time ago, a girl watched a scary movie called 28 Days Later. It was about zombies and a virus that made people angry. She liked it because the women in the movie were strong and smart, not just scared. This was different from other horror movies where girls were often just there to be scared. Now, after many years, a new movie in this series is out. It is called 28 Years Later: The Bone Temple and is directed by a woman named Nia DaCosta. She loved the old movie too and wanted to make a new one that keeps the strong women. The new movie has a girl named Jimmy Ink who helps a boy survive. This shows how horror movies can be fun and fair for everyone.",
