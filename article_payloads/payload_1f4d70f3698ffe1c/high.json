  "title": "Cinematic Representation and Genre Evolution: Analyzing the 28 Days Later Franchise Through a Feminist Lens",
  "summary": "This article critically examines the 28 Days Later franchise's transformative role in horror cinema, particularly for female audiences. Originating with Danny Boyle's 2002 film, the series distinguished itself by subverting traditional gender tropes, offering female characters with emotional realism, agency, and moral complexity—a departure from the prevalent slasher conventions of the late 1990s and early 2000s. The author, drawing on personal experience as a horror fan, argues that this approach fostered a more inclusive viewing experience, acknowledging women as equals both on-screen and in the audience. Decades later, the franchise's evolution is epitomized by Nia DaCosta's direction of 28 Years Later: The Bone Temple, where she leverages her fandom to advance narrative depth, notably through characters like Jimmy Ink, who serves as a moral guide and integral figure. The analysis extends to broader genre shifts, suggesting that such representations challenge patriarchal norms and reflect increasing demands for diversity in media. By integrating interviews with DaCosta and contextual references, the article underscores the franchise's ongoing impact on horror's cultural and aesthetic dimensions, highlighting its significance in discussions of representation and audience engagement.",
