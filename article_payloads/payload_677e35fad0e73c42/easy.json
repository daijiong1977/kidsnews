  "title": "Texas Asks Supreme Court About Election Map",
  "summary": "Texas is asking the Supreme Court to let them use a new map for elections that helps Republicans win more seats. A group of judges said this map might be unfair to Black and Hispanic voters because it could be based on race. Texas wants to use the map quickly because primary elections are coming in March. If the Supreme Court says no, Texas might have to use an older map from 2021. This is part of a bigger fight across the country where states are changing their election maps, and courts are deciding if they are fair. It's important because it affects who gets to vote and who wins in elections.",

    "Elections in the U.S. use maps to decide voting areas. Sometimes, these maps are redrawn to change who can vote where. This is called redistricting. It's important that maps are fair and don't treat people unfairly based on race. The Supreme Court is the top court that can decide if laws or maps are okay. In this case, Texas made a new map that might help one political party more, and judges are worried it could hurt Black and Hispanic voters. This is part of making sure everyone has a fair chance in elections."
