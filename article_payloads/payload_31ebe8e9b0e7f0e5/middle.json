  "title": "Rocky Planet in Outer Orbit Challenges Planet Formation Theories",
  "summary": "Astronomers have discovered a planetary system around the star LHS 1903 that defies conventional planet formation theories. Typically, in systems like our Solar System, rocky planets such as Earth orbit close to the star, while gas giants like Jupiter are found farther out. This pattern is explained by theories suggesting that intense stellar radiation strips gases from inner planets, leaving them rocky, while cooler outer regions allow gas accumulation. However, in the LHS 1903 system, researchers identified a rocky planet, LHS 1903 e, orbiting farthest from the star, alongside inner rocky and gas planets. Using data from telescopes like CHEOPS, the team ruled out explanations such as atmospheric stripping from collisions or planetary migration. Instead, they propose an 'inside out' formation model, where planets form sequentially as conditions change, with LHS 1903 e assembling late when gas was scarce. This discovery, published in Science, prompts a reevaluation of how and when rocky planets can develop in diverse environments.",

    "Planet formation is a key area in astronomy, involving theories about how planets emerge from protoplanetary discs around young stars. Standard models suggest simultaneous formation leading to rocky inner planets and gaseous outer ones due to stellar radiation effects. The discovery of LHS 1903 e challenges this by showing a rocky outer planet, suggesting sequential formation in evolving environments. This highlights the diversity of planetary systems and the need for revised models to account for varying conditions in space."
