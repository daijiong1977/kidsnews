  "title": "A Rocky Planet Far Away Surprises Scientists",
  "summary": "Scientists found a new planet that is very different from what they expected. Usually, rocky planets like Earth are close to their star, and gas planets like Jupiter are far away. But in a system around a star called LHS 1903, there is a rocky planet far from the star. This breaks the rule of how planets form. Astronomers used telescopes to study this system. They think the planets might have formed one after another, not all at the same time. This discovery helps us learn more about how planets are made in space.",

    "In space, planets form around stars from gas and dust. Scientists have seen many systems where rocky planets are close to the star and gas planets are far away. This new discovery challenges that idea, showing a rocky planet far out. It helps us understand that planet formation can be more varied than we thought."
