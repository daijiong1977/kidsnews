  "title": "How the Sun Makes Big Explosions Like a Snow Avalanche",
  "summary": "Scientists used a special spacecraft called Solar Orbiter to watch a big explosion on the Sun called a solar flare. They saw that it starts with small changes in magnetic fields, which are invisible forces around the Sun. These changes grow quickly, like a snow avalanche getting bigger as it rolls downhill. The explosion sends out glowing blobs of hot gas called plasma. Solar flares are very powerful and can affect Earth by causing storms in space that might disrupt radio signals. The scientists were lucky to catch this event because they had the right tools at the right time. This helps us understand how the Sun works and keeps us safe.",

    "The Sun is a star that gives us light and heat. Sometimes, it has big explosions called solar flares, which are caused by magnetic forces. These flares can send energy and particles into space, and if they reach Earth, they might cause problems like disrupting radio communications. Scientists study solar flares to learn more about the Sun and protect our technology."
