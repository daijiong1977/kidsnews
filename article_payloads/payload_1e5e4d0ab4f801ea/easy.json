  "title": "Finding the Invisible Stuff in Space",
  "summary": "Scientists think they have found dark matter, which is a mysterious invisible substance in space. Long ago, an astronomer named Fritz Zwicky noticed that galaxies were moving too fast and suggested dark matter was pulling them with gravity. Now, using a special telescope called Fermi, Professor Totani from Japan has seen gamma rays that might come from dark matter particles crashing into each other. These gamma rays were found near the center of our Milky Way galaxy and match what scientists expected. If this is true, it could be the first time we have directly seen dark matter, which is exciting because it helps us understand how the universe works. But other scientists need to check the results to make sure it's really dark matter.",

    "Dark matter is an invisible substance that scientists believe makes up a lot of the universe. It doesn't give off light, so we can't see it directly, but it has gravity that affects how galaxies move. For almost 100 years, astronomers have been trying to find proof of dark matter. Gamma rays are a type of high-energy light that can come from powerful events in space, like stars exploding or particles colliding. The Fermi telescope is a special instrument in space that helps scientists study gamma rays to learn more about the universe."
