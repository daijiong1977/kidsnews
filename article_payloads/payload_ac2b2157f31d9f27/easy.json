  "title": "Why People Are Upset with the Prime Minister",
  "summary": "This article talks about a problem in the government. The prime minister, Sir Keir Starmer, hired a man named Peter Mandelson. Now, many people are angry because of things Mandelson did. Members of Parliament (MPs) are shocked and angry at Mandelson, but they are also angry with the prime minister for choosing him. People in the Labour Party are worried that Starmer might not stay as prime minister until 2027. They feel unhappy about how the government is handling things. Some think Starmer will have to leave his job sooner or later. The article shows that this anger is not just about one person; it is about bigger problems in the government that have been building for months.",
