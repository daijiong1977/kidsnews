  "title": "Climate Meeting Ends Without Plan to Stop Using Dirty Fuels",
  "summary": "In Brazil, world leaders had a big meeting called COP30 to talk about climate change. They agreed to give more money to countries suffering from bad weather like storms and floods. But they did not make a clear plan to stop using fossil fuels like oil and coal, which cause pollution. Some people are unhappy because they think the agreement is not strong enough. The meeting's leader from Brazil said they will keep working on a plan later, but it won't be as official. This is important because reducing fossil fuels helps protect our planet from getting too hot.",

    "Climate change is when the Earth's weather gets warmer because of gases from burning fossil fuels. This can cause problems like stronger storms and rising sea levels. Countries meet at events like COP to discuss how to reduce pollution and help those affected. Fossil fuels are sources of energy that add to this problem, and many want to use cleaner energy instead."
