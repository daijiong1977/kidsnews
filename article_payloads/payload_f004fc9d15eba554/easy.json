  "title": "Climate Talks in Brazil End Without Plan to Stop Using Fossil Fuels",
  "summary": "In Brazil, countries met for a big climate meeting called COP30 to talk about climate change. They agreed to give more money to help countries that are suffering from bad weather like storms and floods. But they did not make a clear plan to stop using fossil fuels like oil and coal, which cause climate change. Some people are unhappy because they think the agreement is not strong enough. The leaders said they will keep working on a plan later, but it won't be as official. This meeting shows that it's hard for countries to agree on how to protect our planet.",

    "Climate change is when the Earth's weather gets warmer and causes problems like stronger storms and melting ice. Fossil fuels are sources of energy like coal and oil that release gases into the air, making climate change worse. Countries meet at events like COP30 to discuss how to reduce pollution and help those affected. Sometimes, it's hard for all countries to agree because they have different needs and interests."
