  "title": "Dreaming to Solve Puzzles",
  "summary": "Scientists found a way to help people dream about puzzles to boost creativity. They studied 20 people who tried to solve hard puzzles in a lab. Each puzzle had a special sound. When the people slept, the scientists played the sounds to remind them of the puzzles. This made 75% of the people dream about the puzzles. Those who dreamed about the puzzles solved more of them after waking up—42% compared to 17% for puzzles not in dreams. The study shows that sleep and dreams can help us think creatively and solve problems. The scientists hope this can help solve big world problems by using sleep to plant ideas in dreams.",

    "Dreams are fun stories that happen in our minds when we sleep. Scientists study dreams to learn how our brains work. In this study, they wanted to see if dreaming about puzzles could help people solve them better. They used sounds to guide dreams and found it worked for many people. This teaches us that sleep is important for thinking and being creative."
