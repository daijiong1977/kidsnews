  "title": "NHS Cancer Care Challenges",
  "summary": "This article talks about problems in the NHS, which is the healthcare system in the UK. Many NHS trusts, which are groups of hospitals, are having trouble meeting cancer targets. These targets are goals for how quickly patients should be diagnosed and treated for cancer. When targets are missed, it means patients might have to wait longer for care, which can be harmful. Experts say these delays can hurt patients by making their cancer worse. The article includes a tool that lets people check how their local NHS trust is doing. It's important because timely care can save lives, and this issue affects many people across the country.",
