  "title": "John Cena's Legacy and Final WWE Match",
  "summary": "John Cena is preparing for his final WWE match in The Last Time Is Now tournament, set for Saturday night in Washington DC, marking the end of a 23-year career. Since his debut in 2002, he has achieved 17 world titles and popularized the catchphrase \"You Can't See Me.\" Beyond wrestling, Cena is recognized as a film actor and for his philanthropic work with Make-A-Wish, earning him the nickname Mr. Make-A-Wish. His wrestling persona evolved from a \"ruthless aggression\" rookie to a \"Doctor of Thuganomics\" rapper, and finally to a heroic figure embodying a \"Never Give Up\" attitude. Despite criticism from some fans about his in-ring skills, experts like Brandon Thurston from Wrestlenomics affirm his exceptional talent and economic impact. From 2005 to 2015, Cena was WWE's biggest draw, boosting pay-per-view buys, TV ratings, and merchandise sales. The article highlights the shift to a more scripted, family-friendly PG era in 2005, which Cena adapted to successfully. Fans such as Joe Clarkson and Sabrina Nicole praise his longevity, charisma, and consistent good-guy image, underscoring his broad appeal and respect in the industry.",
