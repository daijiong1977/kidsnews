  "title": "UK Joblessness Rises to Highest in Almost Five Years",
  "summary": "In the UK, more people are without jobs than in nearly five years, with the unemployment rate reaching 5.2% at the end of 2025. Young people aged 16 to 24 are especially affected, with 16.1% of them unemployed, the highest since 2020. The government says it is working to help by creating apprenticeships, but some politicians blame tax increases for making it harder for businesses to hire. A young graduate named Lucy is struggling to find a job in publishing because entry-level roles are very competitive and require experience she doesn't have. This situation is part of a broader economic slowdown where companies are hiring less due to higher costs.",

    "Unemployment means people who are able and looking for work cannot find jobs. In the UK, this is measured by the Office for National Statistics (ONS), which collects data on employment. Young people often face higher unemployment because they may lack experience or skills. Governments try to reduce unemployment by creating programs like apprenticeships, where people learn on the job. Businesses hire based on their needs and costs; if costs rise, they might hire fewer people. This article discusses how unemployment has increased recently, especially for young adults, and what different groups are doing about it."
