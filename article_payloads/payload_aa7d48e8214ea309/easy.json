  "title": "A Family's Christmas Problem with Home Insulation",
  "summary": "Tony and Becs Wadley cannot spend Christmas at home because insulation installed in their house caused black mould, making it unsafe for their son Elliott, who has asthma. They got a government grant to make their home warmer to help Elliott, but the insulation led to mould growth in several rooms. Elliott has not been able to live in the house since April and stays with his grandmother. The family will stay with relatives for Christmas to be together. Many other people have reported similar problems with insulation in their homes. The government says it is working to fix these issues and improve the system so families are not let down.",
