  "summary": "A man was arrested by police after a big theft at a museum in Bristol. Over 600 special items were stolen, including old military things, jewelry, and carvings made from ivory and silver. The theft happened late at night in September. Police are still looking for four other people who might be involved. They have shared pictures and videos to ask for help from the public. The stolen items are very important because they have cultural value and come from a museum that closed. The arrested man was let go but is still being investigated. Police want anyone with information to contact them.",
