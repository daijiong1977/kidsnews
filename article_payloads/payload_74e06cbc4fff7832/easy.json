  "title": "Old Bones Tell Stories of Ancient Animals",
  "summary": "Scientists have found tiny chemicals inside old bones from animals that lived millions of years ago. These chemicals, called metabolites, help us learn about the animals' health, what they ate, and the world they lived in. The bones came from places in Africa like Tanzania and South Africa. By studying these metabolites, researchers discovered that the ancient climate was warmer and wetter than today. They used a tool called mass spectrometry to see the chemicals. This new method lets us understand daily life in the past, not just family trees from DNA. It's like reading a diary written in bone!",

    "Fossils are remains of ancient plants and animals that turned into rock over millions of years. Scientists study fossils to learn about life long ago. Metabolites are small molecules in living things that help with digestion and health. Africa is a big continent with many countries, and it has old fossils that tell stories about early humans and animals. Climate change means the weather and environment have changed over time, and scientists use clues like metabolites to understand these changes."
