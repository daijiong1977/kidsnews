  "title": "A Disagreement About a Complaint",
  "summary": "Tulsi Gabbard is a government leader who helps manage intelligence agencies. An attorney says she has not sent a complaint about her actions to Congress for eight months, claiming it needs a legal review. The complaint was made by someone whose identity is secret because of their job. Gabbard's office denies this, saying there is no delay and that the complaint was reviewed and found not credible by an inspector general. They also say the inspector general was not chosen by Gabbard and started work under President Biden. The attorney wants Congress to look into how the complaint was handled. This story involves government rules and whistleblowers who report problems.",

    "This article is about a disagreement in government. Tulsi Gabbard is the Director of National Intelligence, which means she helps manage spy agencies. Sometimes, people in government can make complaints if they think something is wrong; these people are called whistleblowers. There are rules to protect them and send complaints to Congress. In this case, an attorney says a complaint about Gabbard has been delayed, but her office says it was reviewed and found not true. This shows how government officials and whistleblowers sometimes disagree, and Congress might need to step in to check the facts."
