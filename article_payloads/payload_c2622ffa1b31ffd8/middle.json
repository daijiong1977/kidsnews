  "title": "NASA Postpones Artemis II Launch Due to Helium System Issue",
  "summary": "NASA has announced a delay in the Artemis II mission, which aims to send astronauts on a lunar flyby around the Moon. The issue stems from a problem detected in the helium flow system of the Space Launch System (SLS) rocket's upper stage, known as the Interim Cryogenic Propulsion Stage (ICPS). Data showed an interruption in helium flow during a routine operation on Friday evening, prompting NASA Administrator Jared Isaacman to state that repairs must occur inside the Vehicle Assembly Building (VAB). Consequently, the 322-foot-tall rocket will be rolled back from Launch Complex 39B in Florida to the VAB using a crawler-transporter, a process that eliminates the March launch window. NASA had been targeting a launch as early as March 6, following a successful fueling test that addressed previous hydrogen leaks. The helium system is crucial for purging the engine and pressurizing propellant tanks, and while a backup system is currently providing purge air, the root cause—possibly a valve failure, umbilical interface issue, or filter fault—requires physical access only available in the VAB. This delay mirrors a similar problem during the Artemis I mission in 2022. NASA hopes to preserve the April launch window pending repairs and schedule assessments, though uncertainties remain about future fueling tests and seal integrity after transport.",
