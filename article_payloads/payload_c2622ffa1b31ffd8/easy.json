  "title": "NASA Delays Moon Rocket Launch for Repairs",
  "summary": "NASA has a big rocket called the Space Launch System that is supposed to launch astronauts around the Moon in the Artemis II mission. But there is a problem with the rocket's helium system, which helps the rocket work properly. NASA found this issue on Friday, and they cannot fix it while the rocket is on the launch pad in Florida. So, they need to move the rocket back to a big building called the Vehicle Assembly Building (VAB) to repair it. This means the launch, which was planned for March, is now delayed. NASA hopes to try again in April. The rocket is very tall, and it will be moved slowly on a special vehicle called a crawler-transporter. NASA says they are disappointed but want to make sure everything is safe before launching.",

    "NASA is working on the Artemis program to send people back to the Moon. Artemis II is a mission where astronauts will fly around the Moon without landing. Rockets like the Space Launch System are very complex and need careful checks before launch. Sometimes, problems like leaks or system failures can delay launches to ensure safety. NASA has big buildings and special vehicles to handle and repair rockets."
