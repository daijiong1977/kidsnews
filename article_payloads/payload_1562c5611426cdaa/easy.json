  "title": "How Flu Viruses Sneak into Our Cells Like Surfers",
  "summary": "Scientists have watched flu viruses enter human cells in real time using a special microscope. They saw that when a flu virus gets close to a cell, it attaches to molecules on the cell's surface, moving like a surfer on a wave. The cell doesn't just sit there; it helps the virus by forming a pocket to pull it inside. This happens because the virus tricks the cell's normal system for bringing in good things like food. The new microscope, called ViViD-AFM, lets scientists see this live without hurting the cells. This discovery helps us understand how flu makes us sick and could lead to better medicines to stop viruses. The research was done by a team from Switzerland and Japan, led by Professor Yohei Yamauchi.",

    "Flu is a sickness that makes you feel feverish and achy, caused by viruses entering your body through coughs or sneezes. Cells are tiny parts of your body that keep you healthy, but viruses can infect them to make you sick. Scientists study how this happens to find ways to stop viruses. Microscopes help them see very small things, like viruses and cells, up close. This article talks about a new way to watch viruses in action, which could lead to new treatments for flu and other diseases."
