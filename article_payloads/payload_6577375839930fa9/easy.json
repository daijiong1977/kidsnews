  "title": "What Are Genetic Tests and Why Do They Matter?",
  "summary": "This article talks about genetic tests that companies sell to people. It explains that two experts, Daphne and Sam, have different ideas about these tests. Daphne worries that genetic research might make unfairness in society worse, while Sam thinks learning more about genes can help us solve problems. They wrote a book together to share their thoughts. The book discusses myths about genes, like the idea that genes decide everything about us or that race is based on DNA. It also talks about polygenic scores, which are tools that use many genes to guess things like how tall someone might be or if they might get sick. But these scores are not perfect and can be wrong. The article says we need better science education so people understand genetics better. It asks if we are using these tests too fast without knowing enough about them.",
