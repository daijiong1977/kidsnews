  "title": "Plants That Live Without Sunlight or Seeds",
  "summary": "Scientists studied special plants called Balanophora that don't need sunlight or sex to survive. These plants are not green because they don't use photosynthesis like most plants. Instead, they live underground and get food from other plants' roots. They only come up to flower sometimes. Some of these plants make seeds without needing a mate, which helps them live in places where it's hard to find other plants. The study found that all Balanophora plants have very small plastids, which are parts of cells that usually help with photosynthesis. Even though they don't use sunlight, these plastids are still important for the plants. The research helps us understand how plants can live in different ways and what makes a plant a plant.",

    "Plants usually need sunlight to make food through photosynthesis and use sex to make seeds. But some plants, like Balanophora, have found other ways to live. They are called parasitic plants because they take food from other plants. This study looks at how these special plants survive without these common traits, helping scientists learn more about what it means to be a plant."
