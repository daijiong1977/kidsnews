  "title": "Ancient Roman Pool Found Near Rome",
  "summary": "Archaeologists have discovered a huge stone basin near Rome, in the old city of Gabii. It was built around 250 B.C., making it one of the earliest big Roman structures outside temples and walls. The basin might have been a pool in the city center, used for public life. The find helps us learn how early Romans planned their cities, inspired by Greek ideas. Gabii is special because it was abandoned long ago, so its layout is well-preserved. Researchers will keep digging to find more about this ancient site and its artifacts.",

    "The Roman Empire was a powerful ancient civilization that started in Italy around 753 B.C. Romans built cities with forums for public life and were influenced by Greek culture. Archaeology helps us learn about their history by digging up old sites like Gabii, which was a rival to Rome and abandoned long ago, leaving its structures intact for study."
