  "title": "British Gas Makes Less Money Because of Warm Weather",
  "summary": "British Gas, a big energy company in the UK, made less profit in 2025 because the weather was warmer. When it's warm, people use less heating, so British Gas sold less energy. This cost them £80 million. Also, some customers switched to cheaper energy plans, which hurt profits too. Even though profits fell, British Gas got more customers for the first time in over ten years. They now have 7.5 million customers after taking on customers from other companies that closed. The company's boss said it was a tough year, but they are trying to grow. British Gas is part of a bigger group called Centrica, which also saw profits drop. Experts say lower energy prices and less price change made it hard for Centrica to make money. The company paid out money to shareholders but will stop buying back shares to invest in new projects like a nuclear power plant.",
