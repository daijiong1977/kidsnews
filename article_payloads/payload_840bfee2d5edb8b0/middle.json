  "title": "Investigation into Evri: Delivery Failures and Worker Pressures",
  "summary": "This article investigates delivery issues at Evri, a leading parcel delivery company in the UK. It highlights cases where customers, such as Becky in Twyford, Hampshire, did not receive their parcels despite notifications claiming delivery. Similar incidents were reported by neighbors, indicating a pattern of missing packages. The investigation links these problems to pressures on Evri couriers, who are self-employed and paid per parcel. Changes in payment rates, introduced in January, have reduced earnings for couriers like Dave, who estimated his pay would drop below the minimum wage to around £10 per hour. This financial strain forces couriers to cut corners, leading to undelivered parcels. Ofcom's survey shows Evri has the highest customer dissatisfaction among major delivery firms, while companies like Amazon and FedEx score better. The article suggests that Evri's business model, which sets parcel rates and volume targets, contributes to service failures, especially during peak times like Christmas, affecting millions of customers.",

    "Evri is a major delivery company in the UK, handling millions of parcels, especially during busy periods like Christmas. Couriers for Evri are typically self-employed, meaning they are not employees but independent contractors paid per delivery. This payment model can lead to financial pressures if rates are low or parcel volumes are high. Ofcom, as the industry regulator, monitors customer satisfaction and service quality among delivery firms. The National Minimum Wage is a legal requirement to ensure workers earn a fair hourly rate, but self-employed couriers may not always be covered. Understanding these factors helps explain why delivery failures occur and how worker conditions impact service quality."
