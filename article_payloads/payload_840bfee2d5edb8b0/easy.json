  "title": "Delivery Problems at Evri: Parcels Going Missing",
  "summary": "This article talks about problems with a delivery company called Evri. People like Becky and Jonathan ordered things, but their parcels did not arrive even though they got messages saying they were delivered. The article explains that Evri is a big delivery company, but many customers are unhappy because parcels are not delivered. Workers at Evri, who are called couriers, have to deliver many parcels to earn good money. Some couriers, like Dave, left because the pay became too low, making it hard to earn a fair wage. This can lead to mistakes, like parcels being left in wrong places or not delivered at all. The article shows that when couriers are under pressure, customers might not get their items, especially during busy times like Christmas.",

    "Delivery companies like Evri help send packages to people's homes. Couriers are the workers who drive or walk to deliver these parcels. Sometimes, if couriers have too many parcels to deliver or are not paid enough, they might make mistakes, and parcels can get lost or not arrive. This can make customers unhappy, especially during busy times like holidays when many people are shopping online. Understanding how delivery services work helps us see why problems might happen."
