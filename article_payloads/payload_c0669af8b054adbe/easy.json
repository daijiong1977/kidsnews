  "title": "How Earth Kept Water Safe During Its Fiery Start",
  "summary": "Long ago, Earth was very hot and covered in molten rock, making it hard for water to exist. Scientists wondered how water survived to form our oceans today. A new study found that a mineral called bridgmanite, deep inside Earth, acted like a tiny water container. This mineral stored water as Earth cooled down. The researchers used special tools to test how much water bridgmanite could hold under extreme heat and pressure. They discovered it could trap more water than thought, helping Earth become a watery planet. This hidden water might have been key to making Earth a home for life.",

    "Early Earth was very different from today, with a surface so hot that rocks melted into a magma ocean. Water couldn't survive on the surface, so scientists have been curious about how it ended up in our oceans. This article explains a new idea: a mineral deep inside Earth might have stored water safely during this fiery time, helping Earth cool and become a place where life could grow. Understanding this helps us learn how planets change over billions of years."
