  "title": "Unlocking Earth's Water Mystery: The Deep Mantle Reservoir",
  "summary": "Around 4.6 billion years ago, Earth was a molten world with a global magma ocean, too hot for liquid water to exist. Scientists have long puzzled over how water endured to form today's oceans. A recent study led by Prof. Zhixue Du suggests that bridgmanite, the most abundant mineral in Earth's mantle, could have stored significant water deep underground. The researchers used advanced techniques like diamond anvil cells and laser heating to simulate extreme conditions found over 660 kilometers below the surface. They discovered that bridgmanite's ability to trap water increases at high temperatures, meaning it could have held much more water during Earth's fiery early phase than previously thought. This challenges the idea that the lower mantle is dry and proposes that it became a major water reservoir as Earth cooled. Their models estimate this hidden water could be up to 100 times larger than earlier estimates, potentially matching the volume of today's oceans. This finding helps explain Earth's transformation into a life-supporting planet.",

    "Earth formed about 4.6 billion years ago from a hot, chaotic environment with frequent impacts, creating a magma ocean that prevented water from existing on the surface. For decades, scientists have debated how water survived to form oceans, with theories ranging from comet deliveries to internal storage. This article discusses a breakthrough study using high-pressure experiments and advanced imaging to show that bridgmanite in the mantle could trap water efficiently under extreme heat. Understanding this process is crucial for planetary science, as it explains Earth's geologic evolution and the origins of its life-supporting features, offering insights into how other planets might develop water."
