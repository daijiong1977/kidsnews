  "summary": "The 2026 Critics' Choice Awards, hosted by Chelsea Handler at Barker Hangar in Santa Monica, California, celebrated outstanding achievements in film, streaming, and television as determined by critics and journalists. Timothée Chalamet won the Best Actor award for his role in 'Marty Supreme,' where he portrayed an ambitious table-tennis player in the 1950s. During his acceptance speech, he expressed gratitude to his girlfriend Kylie Jenner, publicly declaring his love and thanking her for their foundation, which garnered significant media attention. Jessie Buckley secured the Best Actress award for her performance in 'Hamnet,' a historical drama based on Maggie O'Farrell's novel that explores William Shakespeare's family life after a tragedy. The ceremony also recognized other winners, including the British drama 'Adolescence,' which won four prizes. While the Critics' Choice Awards serve as a momentum booster for Oscar contenders, they are considered less influential than other precursor events. The night featured emotional moments, such as Chalamet's nervous speech and tributes to co-stars and directors, emphasizing the importance of relatable storytelling in cinema.",
