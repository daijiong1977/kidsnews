  "title": "Many Councils Miss Food Waste Collection Deadline",
  "summary": "In England, a new rule says all homes should have weekly food waste collections starting next month. But a BBC investigation found that almost one in four councils will not meet this deadline. Councils say they are delayed because they need special trucks and more money, even though the government gave over £340 million to help. Food waste collected separately can be turned into electricity, which is better for the environment by reducing landfill and greenhouse gases. Some councils have had these collections for over ten years, but others need to start new services. At least 56 councils plan to start by the end of 2026, while nine do not know when they will begin. The environment minister wants councils to do it right but quickly to improve recycling rates.",

    "In England, councils are local groups that handle services like collecting trash from homes. Food waste is leftover food that people throw away. Recycling means reusing waste to make new things, which helps protect the environment by reducing pollution. Landfills are big pits where waste is buried, and they can harm the air and soil. The government makes rules to improve recycling, and councils must follow them, but sometimes they face challenges like needing money or special equipment."
