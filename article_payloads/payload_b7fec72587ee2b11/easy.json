  "title": "A Wolf's Last Meal Tells a Story About Woolly Rhinos",
  "summary": "Scientists found a frozen wolf puppy from 14,400 years ago in Siberia. Inside its stomach, they discovered a piece of meat that was from a woolly rhino, a big animal that lived during the Ice Age but is now extinct. By studying the DNA from this meat, they learned that the woolly rhino population was healthy and not inbred at that time, which was surprising because woolly rhinos disappeared soon after. This discovery helps us understand how animals lived and died long ago. The research shows that even old remains can teach us new things about history.",

    "Long ago, during the Ice Age, big animals like woolly rhinos lived on Earth. They roamed cold places like Siberia but went extinct thousands of years ago. Scientists study old remains, like frozen animals, to learn about these creatures. DNA helps them understand how animals lived and why they died out. This article talks about a wolf puppy that ate a woolly rhino, giving clues about the rhino's last days."
