  "title": "Unlocking Ice Age Secrets: Woolly Rhino DNA from a Wolf's Stomach",
  "summary": "Researchers discovered a 14,400-year-old frozen wolf puppy in Siberia with partially digested woolly rhino meat in its stomach. By sequencing the DNA from this meat, they obtained a complete genome of the woolly rhino, revealing that its population was genetically healthy and not inbred at that time. This finding was unexpected because woolly rhinos went extinct about 400 years later, suggesting they were thriving in northeastern Siberia just before disappearance. The study also compared this genome to an older one from 49,000 years ago, indicating a major population drop between 114,000 and 63,000 years ago, but recovery to a stable size. An effective population of around 1,600 rhinos was sufficient to avoid genetic issues, challenging previous assumptions about their decline. This research highlights how ancient DNA can provide insights into extinction events and population dynamics.",

    "The woolly rhinoceros was a large megafauna species that lived during the Ice Age across Europe and Asia, going extinct around 14,000 years ago. Scientists use paleogenetics to study ancient DNA from remains preserved in permafrost, helping reconstruct past ecosystems. Inbreeding and genetic diversity are key concepts in conservation biology, affecting species survival. This article explores how a wolf's last meal provided a rare genome, offering clues about population stability before extinction, and compares it to older data to trace historical changes."
