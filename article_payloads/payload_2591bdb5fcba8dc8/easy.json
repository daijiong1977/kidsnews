  "title": "Japan's Leader Wants to Work with the U.S. on Special Minerals",
  "summary": "Sanae Takaichi is the leader of Japan, and she was just chosen again to be the prime minister. She is the first woman to have this job in Japan. Takaichi wants to visit the United States next month to talk with President Donald Trump. She hopes they can work together on rare earths, which are special minerals used in things like phones and computers. This is important because Japan and China have been having some disagreements lately. Takaichi also has other plans, like making Japan's military stronger and spending more government money. She was elected with a big win, so her party has a lot of power in Japan's government. Her first job is to help with high prices and slow wages by passing a new budget.",
