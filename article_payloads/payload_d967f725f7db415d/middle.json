  "title": "Using Dinosaur Eggshells to Date Fossils with Isotope Analysis",
  "summary": "Researchers have developed a novel method to date dinosaur fossils by analyzing eggshells using uranium-lead radioisotopic dating. Led by paleontologist Ryan Tucker, the team studied fossilized eggshells from Cretaceous sites in Utah and Mongolia. Eggshells contain calcium carbonate with a unique microstructure that records diagenetic changes during fossilization, such as water damage and compaction fractures. This makes them ideal for dating because they trap uranium and lead isotopes, which decay over time at a known rate. By measuring the ratios of these isotopes, scientists can determine the age of the eggshells and, consequently, the surrounding rock layers and other fossils. The study compared eggshells from Utah's Cedar Mountain Formation, where volcanic ash provided a reference age, and Mongolia's Eastern Gobi Basin, where ages were previously uncertain. Results showed the eggshells were about 95 million years old, aligning with geological expectations despite minor inaccuracies from microfractures. This approach could expand the ability to date continental sedimentary rocks, offering a more reliable tool for paleontology.",

    "Dating fossils is a key challenge in paleontology, as traditional methods like uranium-lead dating are often applied to rocks but less reliably to bones due to alteration during fossilization. Dinosaur eggshells, made of calcium carbonate, offer a promising alternative because they trap isotopes that decay predictably. The Cretaceous period, when many dinosaurs lived, is particularly hard to date accurately in continental settings. This study builds on prior work by using eggshell microstructure to record environmental changes, potentially improving chronological frameworks for evolutionary studies."
