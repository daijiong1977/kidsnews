  "title": "Dinosaur Eggshells Help Tell How Old Fossils Are",
  "summary": "Scientists have found a new way to figure out how old dinosaur fossils are by looking at eggshells. When dinosaurs laid eggs, the shells got buried in sand and mud over millions of years. These eggshells trap special atoms called isotopes, which change over time. By measuring these isotopes, researchers can tell when the eggshells were buried. This helps date other fossils found in the same rock layers. The study used eggshells from Utah and Mongolia, showing the method works in different places. This could make it easier to learn about dinosaur ages and history.",

    "Dinosaurs lived millions of years ago and left behind fossils like bones and eggshells. Scientists study these to understand when dinosaurs existed and how they lived. Dating fossils is tricky because bones can change over time. Eggshells might be a better way because they trap isotopes that decay predictably. This helps build a timeline of dinosaur history."
