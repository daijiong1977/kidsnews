  "title": "A U.S. Leader Visits Hungary",
  "summary": "A top U.S. diplomat named Marco Rubio visited Hungary and supported its leader, Viktor Orban, who wants to be prime minister again. Orban has made rules that limit what news can say and reduce the power of courts in Hungary. He is also friends with Russia's leader, Vladimir Putin, and Hungary still buys oil from Russia even though other countries have stopped. Rubio said that the U.S. and Hungary are connected in many ways, like through money, safety, and culture. This visit happened after a big meeting in Germany where Rubio talked to world leaders. The U.S. wants to fix its relationships in Europe, but some people worry about Orban's actions.",

    "Hungary is a country in Europe with a leader named Viktor Orban who has been in power for a long time. He has made changes that some people think are unfair, like controlling the news and courts. The United States is a big country that often works with other countries on trade and safety. Diplomats like Marco Rubio travel to talk to leaders and help build friendships. Russia is another country that sells oil, but many places try to buy less from it because of conflicts. Understanding how countries interact helps us learn about world events and why leaders make certain decisions."
