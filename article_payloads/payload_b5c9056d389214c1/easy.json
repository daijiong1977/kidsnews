  "summary": "Prince Andrew, the King's brother, has been arrested and taken from his home at Sandringham. He was once a prince living in a big house, but now he is in trouble with the police. The King is trying to help by taking away Andrew's titles and home, and he says he will cooperate with the investigation. Some people think this is bad for the Royal Family, but others say it might not hurt the monarchy itself. They believe the King is doing the right thing by focusing on the law instead of family loyalty. This event is making people talk about how the Royal Family handles problems.",
