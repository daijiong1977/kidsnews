  "title": "From Online Fiction to TV Success: The Story of Heated Rivalry",
  "summary": "Rachel Reid, a Canadian author, wrote a series of queer romance novels about hockey players, which she initially published anonymously online as fan fiction. She believed these books were unadaptable for television, but Heated Rivalry, based on the second book in her Game Changers series, has become a highly popular TV show. The series follows the secret relationship between two rival ice hockey stars, Shane Hollander and Ilya Rozanov, and features explicit content that illustrates their slow-burn romance over eight years. Despite some criticism trivializing it as 'the gay hockey show,' Reid feels proud as the show has garnered a strong community following, with watch parties and events celebrating its positive representation of LGBT relationships in sports. The adaptation is noted for its loyalty to the source material, and Reid emphasizes that enjoying the show aligns with progressive values.",
