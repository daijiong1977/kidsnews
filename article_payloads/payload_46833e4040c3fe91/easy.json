  "title": "New Fire Safety Rules Might Not Keep Buildings Safe",
  "summary": "A construction expert named David Jones is worried about new fire safety rules. He says the rules are too weak and could let dangerous materials stay in buildings. After a big fire called Grenfell, the government made guidelines to make buildings safer, but Mr. Jones thinks these guidelines are not strict enough. They allow materials that can burn to remain if the risk is called 'tolerable.' This means fire might not spread too quickly in tests, but it could still be risky. The government says the rules will help make decisions clearer, but Mr. Jones believes they let builders avoid fixing problems. Many buildings still need repairs years after Grenfell, and only a few have been made completely safe. This article talks about why some people think the new law is not good enough to prevent fires.",

    "After the Grenfell Tower fire in 2017, which killed many people, the UK government started making new rules to improve fire safety in tall buildings. These rules are called guidelines and might become laws. They focus on materials like cladding that can burn. Some experts, like David Jones, think the rules are not strong enough because they allow risky materials if the danger is called 'tolerable.' This means fires might still happen, and many buildings need repairs. The government is trying to balance safety with not causing too many delays in fixing buildings. This issue is important to keep people safe in their homes."
