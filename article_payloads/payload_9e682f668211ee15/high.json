  "title": "Taxonomic Revision in the Calumma gallus Complex: Museomics Unveils Cryptic Diversity in Malagasy Chameleons",
  "summary": "Madagascar, a biodiversity hotspot, harbors over 40% of global chameleon species, including the Calumma gallus complex characterized by males with elongated nasal appendages. For approximately 150 years, the Pinocchio chameleon was classified within this group based on morphological traits. However, integrative genetic and anatomical analyses have necessitated a taxonomic revision, identifying it as a distinct species, Calumma pinocchio. Concurrently, researchers discovered Calumma hofreiteri, previously conflated with Calumma nasutum due to phenotypic similarities. Employing a museomics approach, the team extracted DNA from historical museum specimens, some dating to 1836, facilitating a re-evaluation of species boundaries. Findings suggest rapid evolution of nasal structures, potentially driven by sexual selection via female preference. This study underscores the efficacy of museomics in resolving cryptic species complexes and updates Madagascar's chameleon diversity to 100 species, contributing to a global total of 236. It emphasizes the imperative of combining traditional morphology with genomic data to enhance taxonomic accuracy and inform conservation strategies in hyperdiverse regions.",

    "Chameleons (family Chamaeleonidae) exhibit remarkable adaptations, including zygodactylous feet and independent eye movement, with Madagascar serving as a center of diversification due to its isolation. Taxonomy often relies on morphological characters, but cryptic species complexes challenge this, necessitating molecular tools like museomics, which leverages historical DNA from museum collections. This approach integrates genomics with traditional systematics to revise classifications. Sexual selection, a key evolutionary force, can drive trait diversification, as seen in nasal appendages. Conservation biology depends on accurate taxonomy to prioritize habitats and species, especially in biodiversity hotspots like Madagascar, where endemicity is high. This study exemplifies interdisciplinary research combining herpetology, genetics, and museum science to address long-standing taxonomic questions."
