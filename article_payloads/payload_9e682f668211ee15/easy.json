  "title": "The Pinocchio Chameleon's Secret Identity",
  "summary": "In Madagascar, there is a special chameleon called the Pinocchio chameleon because it has a long nose. Scientists thought they knew this animal for almost 150 years, but new studies show it is actually a different species. They found this out by looking at its DNA and body features. The researchers also discovered another new chameleon species that was hiding in plain sight. They used old museum specimens to study the DNA, which helped them learn more about these animals. Now, Madagascar has 100 chameleon species, adding to the world's total of 236. This discovery shows how science can uncover secrets from the past and help us understand nature better.",

    "Chameleons are cool lizards that live in places like Madagascar, an island with lots of unique animals. They can change color to hide or talk to each other. Scientists study animals by looking at their DNA, which is like a secret code in their bodies. Museums keep old animal specimens so scientists can learn from them even years later. Discovering new species helps us protect animals and understand our world better."
