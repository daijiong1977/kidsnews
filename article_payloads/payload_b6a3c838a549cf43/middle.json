  "title": "Mexican Open Proceeds Amid Security Concerns Following Drug Lord's Death",
  "summary": "The Mexican Open tennis tournament in Acapulco is proceeding as scheduled despite recent violence in Mexico linked to the death of drug baron Nemesio Oseguera Cervantes, known as El Mencho. He died in custody after being captured by special forces in Jalisco state, leading to clashes and unrest by his supporters from the Jalisco New Generation Cartel (CJNG), who have burned businesses and set up blockades. Tournament organizers have denied cancellation rumors, stating they are in constant communication with federal, state, and municipal authorities and following security protocols to ensure safety. The event occurs in Guerrero state, where the US and UK governments have issued travel warnings due to violence. Meanwhile, the Merida Open in Yucatan state is also taking place with increased police presence and additional security measures, as it is not significantly affected by the incidents. Players like Britain's Cameron Norrie and others are competing, with the WTA emphasizing that player and spectator safety remains the top priority.",
