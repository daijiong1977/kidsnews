  "title": "Tennis Tournament in Mexico Continues Despite Violence",
  "summary": "A big tennis event called the Mexican Open is happening in Acapulco, Mexico, even though there has been violence in another part of the country. A dangerous drug leader named El Mencho died, and his supporters have caused trouble by burning things and blocking roads in Jalisco state. The tournament organizers say the event is not canceled and will go on as planned. They are working with police and other authorities to keep everyone safe. Players from Britain and Spain are scheduled to play in the tournament. Another tennis event in Mexico, the Merida Open, is also happening this week in a different state that is not affected by the violence. The organizers promise that safety is their top priority.",
