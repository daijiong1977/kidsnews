  "title": "Bin Workers in Birmingham Have Been on Strike for One Year",
  "summary": "Bin workers in Birmingham, a city in England, have been on strike for one year, which means they stopped working to ask for better pay and job conditions. The strike started on January 6, 2025, and has caused problems like piles of uncollected trash in the streets. The city council says they will still collect household waste, but recycling has not been picked up since February. Some people are frustrated and want the strike to end, while others support the workers. The workers are part of a union called Unite, which is fighting for a fair deal. The strike began because the council wanted to change some jobs, which could mean less money for the workers. There is no agreement yet, so the strike continues with no end in sight.",

    "In Birmingham, England, bin workers collect trash and recycling from homes. Sometimes, workers go on strike to ask for better pay or job conditions. A strike means they stop working until they get what they want. This can cause trash to pile up in streets, which might be smelly or unhealthy. Unions are groups that help workers talk to their bosses. The city council is the local government that makes rules for the city. Recycling is important because it helps the environment by reusing materials."
