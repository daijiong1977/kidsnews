  "title": "States Ask Fossil Fuel Companies to Pay for Climate Change",
  "summary": "Some states in the U.S. want fossil fuel companies to help pay for the costs of climate change. Climate change causes problems like floods and heat waves, which cost a lot of money for things like fixing damaged homes and keeping people healthy. States like Illinois are making laws to create special funds called climate superfunds. These funds would use money from fossil fuel companies to pay for these costs. People support this idea because they think companies that pollute should help fix the problems they cause. Other states like New York and Vermont have already passed similar laws. However, some companies and the government are trying to stop these laws in court.",

    "Climate change is when the Earth's weather gets warmer, causing more floods, heat waves, and storms. This can damage homes, make insurance expensive, and hurt people's health. Fossil fuel companies produce oil and gas, which release pollution that adds to climate change. Some states in the U.S. are making laws to ask these companies to help pay for the costs of fixing these problems, using special funds called superfunds. This is like asking someone who makes a mess to help clean it up."
