  "title": "A New Map Shows Antarctica's Hidden Land",
  "summary": "Scientists have made a new map that shows what Antarctica looks like under all its ice. Antarctica is a very cold continent covered in ice, and we didn't know much about the land beneath it before. Using satellites and science about how ice moves, researchers found thousands of hills and mountains hidden under the ice. This map is much clearer than old ones, like going from a blurry picture to a sharp photo. It helps scientists understand how Antarctica might change as the Earth gets warmer, which could affect sea levels around the world. The map is exciting because it reveals secrets about a place we know less about than some planets.",
