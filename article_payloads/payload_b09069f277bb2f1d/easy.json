  "title": "Keir Starmer's Big Year Ahead",
  "summary": "Keir Starmer is the leader of the Labour Party and became prime minister after winning a big election. But now, just 18 months later, people are talking about whether he will stay as prime minister next year. This is surprising because he has a strong majority in government. The reason for this talk is that there are important elections coming up in May 2026 for places like Wales, Scotland, and local councils in England. If Labour does poorly in these elections, it could hurt Starmer's position. Some Labour members are worried and are quietly planning for what might happen. Even people in other countries are noticing this situation. Starmer himself has joked about the speculation, but it shows that 2026 is a critical year for him.",
