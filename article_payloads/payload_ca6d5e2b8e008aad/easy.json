  "title": "A Great Spot for People to Land on Mars",
  "summary": "Scientists have found a good place on Mars for humans to land in the future. They discovered water ice just under the surface in an area called Amazonis Planitia. Water ice is frozen water, and it is very important for astronauts. They can use it for drinking, making oxygen to breathe, and creating fuel for rockets. This ice is close to the surface, so it is easy to reach. The area gets enough sunlight for power but is cold enough to keep the ice frozen. This makes it a safe and practical landing site. The scientists used special camera images from Mars to find signs of the ice, like craters and patterns on the ground. Having water ice nearby means astronauts can stay on Mars for a long time without needing supplies from Earth. This discovery helps plan for future missions to explore Mars.",

    "Mars is a planet in our solar system that scientists want to explore with humans. It is cold and has a red surface. Water ice is frozen water, and finding it on Mars is exciting because astronauts need water to survive. Landing sites are places where spaceships can safely touch down. This discovery helps plan for future trips where people might live and work on Mars for a long time."
