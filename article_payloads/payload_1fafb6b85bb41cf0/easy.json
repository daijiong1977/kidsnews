  "title": "Amy Dowden Dances Through Cancer Treatment",
  "summary": "Amy Dowden is a dancer on Strictly Come Dancing. She got breast cancer and had to go through chemotherapy, which is a tough treatment. During this time, she danced a little in her lounge at home. This helped her feel better and made her bones stronger. She joined a dance class for older people in Swansea to improve strength and balance. Dancing is good for everyone, no matter how old you are. It can make you more flexible, strong, and confident. A new report says dancing and other arts programs can save money for the NHS in Wales by helping people stay healthy. For example, Sylvie Evans danced to recover from a knee injury and might avoid surgery. Judith Lombardo, who has trouble seeing and balancing, feels steadier after dancing. Amy believes dancing helped her get fit again and wants more people to know about its benefits.",
