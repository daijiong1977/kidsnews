    "Britney Spears is a pop star who became famous in the late 1990s with songs like '...Baby One More Time'. She has sold many records and is one of the best-selling artists. Recently, she ended a conservatorship that lasted 13 years, where her father managed her money and decisions. This sale of her music rights is a big deal because it means she now has more control over her life and money. Other singers have done similar things to secure their futures."
