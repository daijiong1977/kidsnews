  "title": "Trump Wants Greenland: What Denmark Thinks",
  "summary": "President Trump has said many times that he wants to take over Greenland, which is a big island that belongs to Denmark. This has made people in Denmark worried because they don't want to lose their land. Important meetings are happening in Washington with leaders from the U.S., Denmark, and Greenland to talk about this problem. Some people think that if Trump tries to take Greenland, it could cause big trouble for NATO, which is a group of countries that work together for safety. Denmark hopes that talking calmly will help stop Trump's threats. They have friends in NATO who support them and believe Greenland should stay with Denmark. Trump says he might do something about Greenland to stop Russia or China from taking it, but Denmark wants to keep things peaceful.",

    "Greenland is a big, cold island near the Arctic Ocean. It is part of Denmark, which is a small country in Europe. Denmark has owned Greenland for a long time, and the people there have their own government but are still connected to Denmark. NATO is an alliance started after World War II to protect countries from attacks. The United States is a key member of NATO. When President Trump talks about taking Greenland, it makes other countries nervous because it could break the rules of how countries respect each other's land. This situation shows how leaders' words can affect peace and friendship between nations."
