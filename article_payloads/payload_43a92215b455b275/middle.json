  "title": "Rare Superman Comic Discovery Sets Auction Record",
  "summary": "In 2024, three brothers discovered a pristine copy of Superman #1 from 1939 while cleaning their late mother's loft in California. The comic, found in a cardboard box under newspapers, was sold for $9.12 million at Heritage Auctions, making it the most expensive comic ever sold. Their mother had kept it since the Great Depression era, and the cool climate helped preserve its condition, earning it a high grade of 9.0 from CGC. This sale broke the previous record held by Action Comics No. 1, which sold for $6 million. The brothers, who remain anonymous, were surprised by the find, as their mom had mentioned an expensive collection but never showed it. This event highlights the growing value of vintage comics in collectibles markets.",
