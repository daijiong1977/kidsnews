  "title": "Rare Superman Comic Discovery Sets Record Auction Price",
  "summary": "In 2024, three brothers discovered a pristine copy of Superman #1 from 1939 while cleaning their late mother's loft in California. The comic, found in a cardboard box under newspapers, was sold for $9.12 million at Heritage Auctions, making it the most expensive comic book ever sold. This broke the previous record held by Action Comics No. 1, which sold for $6 million. The brothers, who are in their 50s and 60s, had been told by their mother that she owned valuable comics, but they never saw them until after her death. The cool climate in northern California helped preserve the comic, allowing it to receive a high grade of 9.0 from CGC, a grading service. This event highlights how rare items can gain immense value over time and the importance of preservation in collectibles.",
