  "title": "Superman Comic Found in Attic Sells for Millions",
  "summary": "Three brothers found a very old Superman comic book in their mom's attic in California. It was from 1939 and was in great condition. They sold it at an auction for $9.12 million, which is the most money ever paid for a comic book. The comic is called Superman #1 and was kept safe because the weather in California is good for preserving paper. Their mom had bought it a long time ago and told them it was valuable, but they didn't see it until after she passed away. This story is exciting because it shows how something old can become very valuable and make people's lives better.",
