  "title": "President Trump's Speech About Money and Immigrants",
  "summary": "President Trump went to Pennsylvania to talk about how expensive things are for people, which is called affordability. But during his long speech, he spent a lot of time saying bad things about immigrants. This made some people upset because he was supposed to focus on money problems. Two experts, one from the Democratic party and one from the Republican party, shared their thoughts on what Trump said. They had different opinions about his speech. This shows how politicians sometimes change what they talk about when they are campaigning.",
