  "title": "Trump's Affordability Speech Diverts to Immigration Criticism",
  "summary": "President Trump delivered a speech in Pennsylvania intended to address affordability concerns, which have negatively impacted his approval ratings. However, the speech extended over an hour and a half, with a significant portion dedicated to a rant against immigrants. This shift from economic issues to immigration rhetoric occurred in a campaign-style setting. The PBS NewsHour report included analysis from Democratic strategist Ameshia Cross and Republican Tiffany Smiley, offering bipartisan perspectives on Trump's approach. Cross likely emphasized the distraction from real economic problems, while Smiley may have framed it as legitimate political discourse. This event highlights how political leaders can pivot topics to resonate with specific audiences, especially during election cycles, raising questions about policy priorities and public communication strategies.",
