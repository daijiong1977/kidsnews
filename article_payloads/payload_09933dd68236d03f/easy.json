  "title": "Ukraine's Big Decision for Peace",
  "summary": "President Trump has given Ukraine a deadline to accept his peace plan to end the war with Russia. The plan asks Ukraine to give up some things it has always said no to, like parts of its land or freedom. President Zelenskyy of Ukraine says his country has a hard choice: agree to the plan and maybe lose what they have been fighting for, or say no and risk losing help from the United States. Russia likes the plan because it could help them. This is a big moment for Ukraine, as they must decide what is best for their people and their future. The story shows how leaders talk and make decisions to try to stop fighting.",

    "This article is about a conflict between Ukraine and Russia that started when Russia invaded Ukraine. Ukraine is a country in Europe fighting to keep its land and freedom. The United States, led by President Trump, is a powerful country that has been helping Ukraine. A peace plan is a proposal to stop the fighting, but it often requires compromises. In this case, Ukraine might have to give up some things it values, like control over certain areas, to make peace. This decision is hard because it affects Ukraine's future and the safety of its people."
