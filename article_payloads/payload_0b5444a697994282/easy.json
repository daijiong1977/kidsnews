  "title": "Making Ships That Can't Sink",
  "summary": "Scientists have found a way to make metal tubes that never sink, even if they get holes in them. They work at the University of Rochester and used a special laser to change the inside of aluminum tubes. This makes the tubes repel water, so air gets trapped inside and keeps them floating. It's like how spiders and ants use air bubbles to stay afloat in water. The tubes can be connected to build rafts for boats or platforms. This could help make ships safer and even create energy from waves. The research was funded by groups like the National Science Foundation.",

    "This article is about a new invention that could help prevent ships from sinking. Scientists have been trying to make unsinkable ships for over 100 years, since the Titanic sank. They used lasers to change metal tubes so they repel water and trap air inside, keeping them floating even with holes. This idea comes from nature, like spiders and ants that use air bubbles. The tubes can be scaled up for big boats or platforms and might even help make energy from waves. It's a cool example of how science can solve problems and make things safer."
