  "title": "Advancing Unsinkable Ship Technology with Superhydrophobic Tubes",
  "summary": "Researchers at the University of Rochester's Institute of Optics have developed a breakthrough technique to create unsinkable metal tubes, marking progress toward unsinkable ships. Led by Professor Chunlei Guo, the team used laser etching to modify aluminum tubes, creating microscopic pits that make the interior superhydrophobic, meaning it strongly repels water. This allows the tubes to trap a stable air pocket inside, preventing water from entering and keeping them afloat even when damaged with holes. Inspired by natural examples like diving bell spiders and fire ants, the design includes a divider to maintain buoyancy when pushed vertically. Compared to earlier superhydrophobic disks from 2019, the tube-based design offers improved stability in turbulent conditions, as tested over weeks without degradation. The tubes can be scaled up and connected to form rafts for ships, buoys, or platforms, and they also show potential for renewable energy by capturing wave energy. Funded by organizations like the National Science Foundation, this research addresses long-standing safety goals in maritime engineering.",

    "This article explores a scientific advancement in creating unsinkable structures, building on over a century of efforts since the Titanic disaster. Researchers at the University of Rochester focused on superhydrophobic surfaces, which repel water, to develop aluminum tubes that trap air and remain buoyant even when damaged. The study, published in Advanced Functional Materials, details how laser etching creates microscopic pits for this effect. The technology draws inspiration from nature, such as diving bell spiders that use air bubbles, and improves upon earlier designs by enhancing stability in ocean-like conditions. Potential applications include safer ships, floating platforms, and renewable energy from waves, supported by funding from the National Science Foundation and others. This highlights interdisciplinary work in optics, physics, and engineering to address practical challenges in maritime safety and sustainability."
