  "title": "A Man with Tourette's and a Mistake on TV",
  "summary": "John Davidson has Tourette's syndrome, which makes him say words he can't control. At a big awards show called the Bafta Film Awards, he shouted a bad word while black actors were on stage. He was sitting near a microphone, so his words were heard on TV. John thinks the BBC, the TV company, should have tried harder to stop his words from being broadcast because they know about his condition. The BBC said sorry and removed the part from their online player. They also edited out another bad word before the show. John shouted about 10 bad words that night, but only one got a lot of attention. He wants to say sorry to the actors. Google also said sorry for sending a news alert with the bad word. John's movie studio talked to Bafta before the show about his tics, and Bafta said any swearing would be cut out. John has made shows with the BBC before and thinks they should have known better. Bafta apologized too for the harm caused.",

    "Tourette's syndrome is a brain condition that causes people to have tics, which are sudden movements or sounds they can't stop. It often starts in childhood and can include shouting words. Awards shows like the Bafta Film Awards are big events where actors and filmmakers get awards for movies. TV companies like the BBC broadcast these shows live, so they have to be careful about what they show. Sometimes, mistakes happen, and people say sorry to make things better."
