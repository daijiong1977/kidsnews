  "title": "Tourette's Advocate Criticizes BBC Over Broadcast Slur Incident",
  "summary": "John Davidson, a campaigner for Tourette's syndrome, has criticized the BBC for not preventing his involuntary tics from being broadcast during the Bafta Film Awards. Davidson, who has Tourette's, shouted a racist slur while black actors Michael B. Jordan and Delroy Lindo were on stage. He questions why he was seated near a microphone, suggesting the BBC should have anticipated this given his condition. The BBC apologized, stating the language resulted from involuntary tics associated with Tourette syndrome and removed the segment from BBC iPlayer. They also edited out another racial slur before broadcast. Davidson noted he shouted about 10 offensive words that night, but media focused on one. He has contacted Warner Bros to apologize to the actors and others affected. Google also apologized for a news alert containing the slur. Davidson's film studio, StudioCanal, had discussions with Bafta about his tics, with assurances that swearing would be edited out. He has previously worked with the BBC on documentaries and believes they should have been more prepared. Bafta issued an apology for the harm caused. The incident highlights challenges in broadcasting live events involving individuals with involuntary conditions and the responsibilities of media organizations.",

    "Tourette syndrome is a neurological disorder characterized by repetitive, involuntary movements and vocalizations called tics. It often begins in childhood and can include shouting obscenities, known as coprolalia, though this is rare. The Bafta Film Awards are prestigious ceremonies in the UK film industry, broadcast live, requiring careful production to handle unexpected events. Media organizations like the BBC have ethical responsibilities to avoid broadcasting harmful content, especially in live settings. Apologies from companies like Google highlight how automated systems can propagate errors, emphasizing the need for oversight. This incident underscores the balance between inclusivity for individuals with disabilities and the challenges of live broadcasting."
