  "title": "Should the U.S. Keep a Nuclear Treaty with Russia?",
  "summary": "The United States and Russia have a treaty called New START that limits how many nuclear weapons they can have. This treaty is about to expire, and people are debating whether the U.S. should keep it or end it. Rose Gottemoeller, who helped make the treaty, thinks the U.S. should keep it because it stops Russia from building too many nuclear weapons quickly. She says this is important because China is also building more nuclear weapons, and the U.S. needs to focus on that. Frank Miller, another expert, might have a different view, but the article mainly talks about Gottemoeller's opinion. The treaty helps control dangerous weapons and keep peace between countries.",

    "Nuclear weapons are very dangerous tools that countries use for protection, but they can cause huge harm. Treaties like New START are agreements to limit these weapons and prevent conflicts. The United States and Russia have had such treaties for years to keep peace. When a treaty expires, countries must decide whether to renew it or not, which can affect global safety. This debate involves experts who study weapons and security to give advice."
