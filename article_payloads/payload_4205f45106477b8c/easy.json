  "title": "Museums Add Smells to Egyptian Mummy Displays",
  "summary": "Museums are making Egyptian mummy exhibits more exciting by adding special smells. Scientists found out what ancient Egyptians used to preserve bodies, like plant oils and resins. They worked with a perfume maker to recreate a smell called 'the scent of eternity.' This smell helps visitors feel like they are in ancient Egypt and understand mummification better. Mummification is a process where bodies were dried and wrapped to keep them safe after death. It started a long time ago when people noticed hot sand could preserve bodies. Museums now use this smell to make learning fun and emotional. The smell comes from ingredients like pine, beeswax, and bitumen. This new idea makes museums more interactive and helps people connect with history through their senses.",

    "Ancient Egypt was a civilization in Africa known for pyramids, pharaohs, and mummies. Mummification was a way to preserve bodies after death, often for religious reasons. Museums are places where people can learn about history by looking at objects. Adding smells to exhibits makes the experience more real and helps people feel emotions, like curiosity or wonder. This project shows how science and art can work together to teach us about the past."
