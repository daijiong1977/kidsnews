  "title": "Super Fast Computers with New Materials",
  "summary": "Scientists have created a new material called 'gyromorphs' that can block light from all directions. This material mixes random parts like liquids with big patterns. It helps solve problems with older designs and could make computers much faster. Photonic computing uses light instead of electricity to process information, and this new material might make it work better. This is exciting because faster computers can help us do things like play games, learn, and solve big problems more quickly. Researchers are working hard to improve technology for the future.",
