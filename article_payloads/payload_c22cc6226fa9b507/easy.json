    "Pecans are nuts that have been important for thousands of years. Native Americans in the southern U.S. used them as food and for trading because they are nutritious and easy to carry. Pecan trees grow wild in that area, so people did not have to plant them. Over time, pecans became more popular, and now they are a big part of holiday meals, especially in pies. The article tells the story of how pecans changed from being ignored to a beloved food."
