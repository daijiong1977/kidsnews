    "Pecans are nuts that have been important for thousands of years. Native Americans in the southern U.S. used them for food, medicine, and trading with others. The name 'pecan' comes from an Algonquin word meaning a nut that is hard to crack. Pecan trees grow well in places like Georgia and Texas, and they produce nuts that people eat raw or in cooked dishes. Over time, pecans became more popular, especially during holidays, and now the U.S. grows most of the world's pecans. This history shows how a simple nut can become a big part of American culture."
