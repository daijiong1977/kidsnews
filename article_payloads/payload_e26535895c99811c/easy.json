  "title": "Why Some Volcanoes Don't Explode",
  "summary": "Volcanoes can erupt in different ways. Some explode with a big bang, while others just let lava flow out slowly. Scientists used to think that gas bubbles in magma only form when the pressure drops, like when you open a soda bottle and bubbles appear. But now, they found another reason: shear forces. Shear forces happen when magma moves at different speeds inside the volcano, kind of like stirring honey. This can make bubbles form deep down and let gas escape early, so the volcano doesn't explode. For example, Mount St. Helens and Quizapu volcano sometimes have gentle eruptions even with lots of gas. This new discovery helps us understand volcanoes better and keep people safe.",

    "Volcanoes are openings in the Earth's crust where magma, ash, and gas can escape. Eruptions can be explosive or gentle. Scientists study them to predict when they might erupt and warn people. Gas bubbles in magma play a big role in how violent an eruption is. Understanding this helps in disaster preparedness and learning about Earth's geology."
