  "title": "Unraveling the Secrets of Non-Explosive Volcanoes",
  "summary": "Volcanic eruptions vary widely, from violent explosions to slow lava flows, and scientists have long been puzzled by why some gas-rich volcanoes do not erupt explosively. Traditionally, it was thought that gas bubbles in magma form only when pressure decreases during ascent, similar to opening a carbonated drink. However, this explanation fails to account for instances like Mount St. Helens and Quizapu, which occasionally produce gentle eruptions. Recent research published in Science by an international team, including experts from ETH Zurich, reveals that shear forces—caused by differential movement of magma in volcanic conduits—can also initiate bubble formation deep within the Earth. This process allows gas to escape early through merged bubbles, reducing explosivity. By studying these mechanisms, scientists aim to enhance eruption forecasting and mitigate risks to human populations, using analogies like stirring honey to illustrate complex fluid dynamics.",

    "Volcanoes are geological features where magma erupts onto the surface, and their behavior depends on factors like gas content and magma viscosity. Historically, the decompression model explained bubble formation through pressure reduction, but it didn't account for all eruption types. Shear forces, studied in fluid dynamics, refer to stresses from velocity gradients in fluids. In volcanology, this helps understand how magma flows in conduits, with implications for hazard assessment. Research from institutions like ETH Zurich advances our knowledge, using experiments and field studies to model volcanic processes and enhance predictive capabilities for community safety."

The purpose is to address a scientific puzzle and improve eruption forecasting for safety. Evidence evaluation shows reliance on peer-reviewed research in Science, with analogies and specific volcano examples supporting the claims. Author credibility is high, involving an international team with expertise from ETH Zurich, known for rigorous scientific work. Methodology includes theoretical models and comparisons to fluid dynamics, such as the honey-stirring analogy, to illustrate complex processes in volcanic conduits."
