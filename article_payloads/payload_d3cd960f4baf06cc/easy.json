    "This article is about a serious accusation against a celebrity. In the UK, police can arrest someone if they have reasons to think a crime happened. Rape is a very harmful act, and laws are in place to protect people. When someone is released on bail, it means the investigation isn't over, and they must cooperate. It's important to understand that everyone is innocent until proven guilty in court. This helps ensure fairness in society."
