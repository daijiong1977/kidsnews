  "title": "Should Babies Get a Shot to Stay Healthy?",
  "summary": "A group of doctors and experts is having a meeting to talk about a vaccine for babies. The vaccine helps protect against a sickness called hepatitis B, which can hurt the liver. Right now, doctors say all babies should get this shot on their first day of life. But some people, including a committee led by Robert F. Kennedy Jr., might want to change this rule. Other doctors, like those from the American Academy of Pediatrics, say the vaccine is important because it saves lives by preventing cancer and other liver problems. The meeting will happen live, so people can watch and learn more about why this decision is being made. It's a big discussion about keeping babies safe and healthy.",
