  "title": "Canal Collapse Leaves Boaters Stuck for Christmas",
  "summary": "A big hole appeared in the Llangollen Canal in Shropshire, England, on Monday, causing water to flood out and leaving many people stranded for Christmas. The hole was caused by the embankment collapsing, not a sinkhole. Two boats fell into a deep trench, and others are stuck on dry land. People who live on narrowboats full-time, called liveaboards, cannot pass through the area. They are stuck on either side of the collapse. Geoff and Pamela Poole, a couple from the USA, were very close to the hole and had to leave their boat. They woke up when neighbors banged on their door early in the morning. Their boat was tilting, and their Christmas tree and ornaments fell and broke. They had just retired and moved to England to live on their boat. Now, they have to stay in a hotel for Christmas and don't know when they can return to their boat. This is very disruptive for them and others.",

    "Canals are waterways built for boats to travel, often used for transportation or living. In England, many people live on narrowboats in canals. An embankment is like a wall that keeps water in the canal. When it collapses, water floods out, creating holes and stranding boats. This can be dangerous and disrupt people's lives, especially during holidays like Christmas."
