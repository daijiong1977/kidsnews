  "title": "A Big Attack on Iran by the US and Israel",
  "summary": "The United States and Israel have attacked Iran together. This happened because Iran might be making nuclear weapons, which are very dangerous. The attacks caused explosions in many cities in Iran, like Tehran, Isfahan, and Qom. People saw smoke and heard loud noises. The US president, Donald Trump, said the US is doing this to protect Americans and stop Iran from getting nuclear weapons. He told people in Iran to stay inside their homes to be safe. We don't know yet if anyone got hurt. Iran closed its airspace, which means planes can't fly there right now. This is a big event that started after weeks of talks and threats.",
