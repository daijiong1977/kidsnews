  "title": "Joint US-Israel Military Strike on Iran: Causes and Impacts",
  "summary": "In a coordinated military operation, the United States and Israel launched attacks on Iran, targeting multiple cities including Tehran, Isfahan, Qom, Karaj, and Kermanshah. The strikes, described as \"pre-emptive\" by Israel and \"major combat operations\" by US President Donald Trump, followed weeks of tensions over Iran's nuclear program. Explosions were reported across Iran, with verified videos showing smoke plumes near key locations such as Leadership House, the office of Iran's Supreme Leader. Trump confirmed US involvement, stating the objective is to defend Americans by eliminating threats from the Iranian regime and preventing Iran from obtaining nuclear weapons. He advised Iranian citizens to seek shelter. Casualties are unknown, and Iran has closed its airspace. This event marks a significant escalation after diplomatic negotiations failed, highlighting global security concerns.",
