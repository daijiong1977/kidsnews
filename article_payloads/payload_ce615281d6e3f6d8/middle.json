  "title": "Ashley Tisdale's Experience with Toxic Mom Groups",
  "summary": "Ashley Tisdale, a 40-year-old actress and singer known for roles in Disney Channel and High School Musical, has publicly discussed her decision to leave a 'toxic mom group.' After the birth of her first daughter in 2021, she initially found value in having a 'village of moms' for support. However, the group's dynamics shifted, resembling high school cliques, where she felt 'frozen out' and excluded by some members. Tisdale noticed social events occurring without her and a growing distance, which reminded her of past negative experiences. She described feeling not 'cool enough' and decided to cut ties, sending a message to the group stating it was 'too high school' for her. Although her message was not well-received initially, some mothers attempted to reconcile. Tisdale emphasized that the group had become unhealthy for her, though she did not label the individuals as bad people. Her story, shared in an article for the Cut adapted from her blog, resonated with many women who had similar experiences, highlighting the challenges of maintaining positive social connections in motherhood.",
