  "summary": "Sam Fender and Olivia Dean have made history in the UK music charts. Their song, Rein Me In, reached number one after 35 weeks, which is the longest time any song has spent in the top 40 before becoming number one. The song is a duet about a relationship ending and was first released last June. It had been at number five three times before finally reaching the top. Sam said the song took a long time to become popular because people discovered it online over time. Olivia added a new verse from a female perspective, making the song better. They performed it together at big stadiums in London and Newcastle. This is Sam's first number one single, while Olivia has had other hits. The song replaced Taylor Swift's Opalite at number one.",
