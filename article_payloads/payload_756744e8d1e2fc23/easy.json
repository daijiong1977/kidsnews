  "title": "Former President Bolsonaro Arrested in Brazil",
  "summary": "In Brazil, the former president Jair Bolsonaro was arrested by the police because they thought he was planning to run away to avoid going to jail. He was supposed to start a 27-year prison sentence for trying to take over the government after he lost an election. The police went to his house early on Saturday and took him to their office in Brasilia. A judge named Alexandre de Moraes ordered the arrest because Bolsonaro's ankle monitor was broken, and the judge was worried he might escape during a protest organized by his son. Bolsonaro's lawyers said he did not break the monitor and that the arrest was not fair. This event is part of a big court case that has divided the country.",

    "Brazil is a big country in South America with a president as its leader. Jair Bolsonaro was the president from 2019 to 2022, but he lost an election to Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva. After losing, some people say Bolsonaro tried to stay in power illegally, which is called a coup attempt. This led to a court case where he was found guilty and sentenced to prison. In Brazil, the federal police and Supreme Court judges help keep the law and order. Arrests happen when someone is suspected of breaking rules, and judges make sure things are fair."
