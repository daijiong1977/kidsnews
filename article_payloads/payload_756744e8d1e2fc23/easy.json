  "title": "Former President Bolsonaro Arrested in Brazil",
  "summary": "In Brazil, the former president Jair Bolsonaro was arrested by police because they thought he was planning to escape and avoid going to prison. He was supposed to start a 27-year prison sentence for trying to stay in power after losing an election. The police went to his house early on Saturday and took him to their headquarters. A judge named Alexandre de Moraes ordered the arrest because Bolsonaro's ankle monitor was broken, and the judge worried he might run away during a protest organized by his son. Bolsonaro's lawyers said he did nothing wrong. This arrest is a big event in Brazil's politics, and the Supreme Court will decide if it was right on Monday.",

    "Brazil is a large country in South America with a democratic government where leaders are elected. Jair Bolsonaro was the president of Brazil but lost an election to Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva. After that, Bolsonaro was accused of trying to stay in power illegally, which is called a coup attempt. He was found guilty and sentenced to prison. In many countries, people who break the law can be arrested to prevent them from running away, especially if they are important figures. This article talks about his recent arrest because police thought he might escape during a protest."
