  "title": "Major Winter Storm Disrupts Travel and Power Nationwide",
  "summary": "A severe winter storm swept across the United States, leading to the cancellation of thousands of flights and creating hazardous conditions over the weekend. The storm, which impacted roughly 140 million people or over 40% of the U.S. population, prompted winter storm warnings from New Mexico to New England. The National Weather Service forecasted widespread heavy snow, sleet, and freezing rain from Saturday to Monday, warning that the ice and snow would melt slowly, hindering recovery efforts. In response, President Donald Trump approved emergency declarations for at least a dozen states, while the Federal Emergency Management Agency pre-positioned resources like commodities and search teams. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem urged people to stay home if possible, and state officials such as New Jersey Governor Mikie Sherrill imposed travel restrictions, including a 35 mph speed limit on highways. Crews worked to restore downed power lines in southern states, and forecasters noted that the damage, particularly from ice, could rival that of a hurricane, emphasizing the storm's intensity and prolonged impact.",

    "Winter storms in the U.S. are complex weather events that involve heavy precipitation like snow and ice, often leading to significant disruptions. The National Weather Service issues warnings based on forecasts to alert the public, while emergency declarations by the President activate federal resources through agencies like FEMA. State governors play a key role in implementing local measures, such as travel restrictions, to mitigate risks. Recovery efforts typically involve utility crews restoring power and transportation agencies clearing roads. Understanding these processes helps middle school students grasp how government and weather agencies collaborate during natural disasters to protect communities and manage crises effectively."
