  "title": "Big Winter Storm Stops Flights Across America",
  "summary": "A huge winter storm hit the United States over the weekend, causing thousands of flights to be canceled. The storm brought heavy snow, ice, and freezing rain, making roads dangerous and knocking out power for many people. About 140 million Americans, which is more than 40% of the country, were warned about the storm from New Mexico to New England. Officials like the National Weather Service told people to stay home and be safe because the ice and snow will take a long time to melt. President Trump approved emergency help for many states, and crews worked to fix power lines. Governors in states like New Jersey asked drivers to slow down and stay indoors. This storm is very powerful and could cause as much damage as a hurricane in some areas.",

    "Winter storms are big weather events that happen in cold months, bringing snow, ice, and freezing temperatures. They can make travel dangerous by covering roads with ice and causing flights to be canceled. In the U.S., agencies like the National Weather Service warn people about storms so they can prepare. Emergencies are declared to get help to states quickly, and leaders like governors give advice to keep everyone safe. Storms like this one can last for days and cause problems similar to hurricanes, so it's important to listen to warnings and stay indoors."
