  "title": "NASA's Moon Trip Delayed by Rocket Problem",
  "summary": "NASA has delayed a big mission to send astronauts to the Moon because of a problem with the rocket. The mission, called Artemis II, was supposed to launch on March 6, but during checks, engineers found an issue with helium flow. Helium is important for cooling and pressurizing the rocket. Four astronauts from the US and Canada are ready for a 10-day trip to the far side of the Moon and back, which would be the farthest humans have ever traveled in space. NASA says the delay is disappointing, but they need to fix the problem to keep everyone safe. This mission is a step toward landing astronauts on the Moon again by 2028. Space missions often have setbacks, like Neil Armstrong's mission in 1966 that had to end early due to a technical issue.",
