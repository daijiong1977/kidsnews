  "title": "Skupski and Harrison Claim Australian Open Doubles Victory",
  "summary": "Neal Skupski of Great Britain and Christian Harrison of the United States secured the Australian Open men's doubles championship, marking their first Grand Slam triumph as a team. They defeated Australian wildcards Jason Kubler and Marc Polmans in straight sets, 7-6 (7-4) 6-4, showcasing strong performance with only one set lost throughout the tournament. Skupski, aged 36, previously won Wimbledon in 2023 with Wesley Koolhof and had a successful 2025 season with Joe Salisbury before Salisbury's break due to anxiety. Harrison, 31, partnered with Skupski for the first time in Adelaide, reaching the semi-finals, which built momentum for their Australian Open success. Skupski expressed satisfaction with their developing partnership, noting Harrison's energy and compatibility. This victory highlights a trend of British success in men's doubles, with wins in three of the last five Grand Slams, including previous titles by Henry Patten and the duo of Julian Cash and Lloyd Glasspool.",
