  "title": "Israel Knocks Down UN Offices for Palestinian Refugees",
  "summary": "In Jerusalem, Israeli forces knocked down offices of the United Nations Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA), which helps Palestinian refugees. This happened on Tuesday in two places: Sheikh Jarrah and Qalandia. Israel says UNRWA has ties to Hamas, a group it is fighting, but UNRWA denies this and says it helps millions of people with food, schools, and jobs. The UN Secretary-General said this action is wrong and against international law. During the demolition, tear gas was used near a school, hurting some children. Israel says it owns the land and made a new law to ban UNRWA, but UNRWA wants its offices back to keep helping refugees.",

    "UNRWA is a United Nations agency started in 1949 to help Palestinian refugees who lost their homes in conflicts. It provides services like education, healthcare, and food in places like Gaza, the West Bank, and Jerusalem. Israel and Palestine have been in a long dispute over land, with both claiming Jerusalem as their capital. Hamas is a Palestinian group that Israel considers a terrorist organization, and there have been wars between them. International law includes rules to protect civilians and refugees during conflicts."
