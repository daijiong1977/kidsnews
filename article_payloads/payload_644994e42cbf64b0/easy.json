  "title": "New Rules for Voting in America",
  "summary": "Some lawmakers in the U.S. government want to change how people vote in elections. They are called House Republicans, and they have made a plan with new rules. One rule says you need to show a photo ID, like a driver's license, before you can vote. Another rule says you must prove you are a U.S. citizen when you sign up to vote. These rules might start in 2027. They also want to stop some voting methods that let people vote by mail or rank their choices. The lawmakers say these changes will make elections fair and honest, so people can trust the results. But other lawmakers, called Democrats, disagree. They think the new rules could make it harder for some people to vote, especially if they don't have an ID or find it tough to prove citizenship. This is happening before important elections in November, where Congress will decide who is in charge. The plan has a long name, the 'Make Elections Great Again Act,' and it is a big bill with over 120 pages. It might not pass because Congress is closely divided.",

    "In the United States, voting is a way for citizens to choose their leaders, like the President or members of Congress. Elections happen regularly, and there are rules about how people can vote. Some people think the rules should be strict to prevent cheating, while others think they should be easy so everyone can vote. This article talks about a new plan to change these rules, which is a big debate in politics. Understanding voting helps us learn about democracy and how our government works."
