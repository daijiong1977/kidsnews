  "title": "How Tiny Particles Form in a Giant Machine",
  "summary": "Scientists at CERN's Large Hadron Collider have discovered how tiny particles called deuterons form. Deuterons are made of one proton and one neutron stuck together. In the collider, protons crash into each other at super high speeds, creating temperatures hotter than the Sun. For years, researchers wondered how delicate deuterons could survive this heat without breaking apart. Now, they found that about 90% of deuterons form later, when things cool down a bit, from short-lived high-energy states called resonances. This helps explain a basic force in nature that holds particles together. The discovery also helps us understand how particles form in space, like in cosmic rays, and might give clues about dark matter. The research was done using a big experiment called ALICE, which tracks particles from collisions.",

    "Scientists study tiny particles to understand how the universe works. At CERN, they use a big machine called the Large Hadron Collider to smash protons together, creating conditions like just after the Big Bang. This helps them learn about forces that hold atoms together and how matter forms. Deuterons are simple particles made of a proton and neutron, and figuring out how they survive in extreme heat is a big puzzle. The discovery also connects to space, where similar particles form in cosmic rays, and might help solve mysteries like dark matter. Experiments like ALICE track these particles to give us clues."
