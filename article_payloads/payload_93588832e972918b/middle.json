  "title": "Unlocking the Secrets of Particle Formation at the Large Hadron Collider",
  "summary": "Researchers at CERN's Large Hadron Collider have resolved a key mystery in particle physics by explaining how deuterons, light atomic nuclei composed of one proton and one neutron, form under extreme conditions. In proton collisions that generate temperatures over 100,000 times hotter than the Sun's core, deuterons were previously thought to break apart instantly due to their fragile nature. However, experiments consistently detected them. The new study reveals that approximately 90% of deuterons and their antimatter counterparts, antideuterons, form through the decay of short-lived, high-energy resonances. This process occurs later in the collision, when conditions have cooled slightly, rather than during the initial hot stage. Led by Prof. Laura Fabbietti and Dr. Maximilian Mahlein from the Technical University of Munich, the research provides crucial insights into the strong interaction, the fundamental force binding protons and neutrons. It also has broader implications for understanding cosmic ray interactions and dark matter, as light nuclei form similarly in space. The findings were obtained using the ALICE experiment, which tracks particles to reconstruct collision events, advancing models of nuclear formation and cosmic data interpretation.",

    "Particle physics explores the fundamental building blocks of matter and the forces that govern them. CERN's Large Hadron Collider is a premier facility where protons are collided at near-light speeds to recreate conditions akin to the early universe. Deuterons, as simple nuclei, serve as probes for understanding the strong interaction, which is crucial for nuclear stability. The mystery of their survival in high-energy environments has puzzled scientists, with implications for astrophysics, as similar processes occur in cosmic rays. Research clusters like ORIGINS and SFB1258 support this work by studying cosmic origins and dark matter. This article highlights how experimental advances, such as those from the ALICE detector, enable breakthroughs that bridge laboratory physics and cosmic phenomena, enhancing our comprehension of the universe's formation."
