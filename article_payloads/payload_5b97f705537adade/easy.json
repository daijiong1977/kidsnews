  "title": "How Giant Viruses Might Have Helped Create Complex Life",
  "summary": "Scientists are exploring how viruses, tiny particles that need host cells to survive, might have played a big role in the origin of complex life on Earth. A theory called viral eukaryogenesis suggests that a large virus could have infected a simple cell long ago and, instead of harming it, stayed inside and slowly turned into the nucleus, which is the control center of complex cells like those in plants and animals. This idea got support from the discovery of giant DNA viruses, which create structures inside cells that look like simple nuclei. Recently, researchers found a new giant virus named ushikuvirus that infects amoebas, adding more evidence to this theory. Giant viruses are diverse and hard to study, but each new find helps scientists understand how life evolved. Professor Takemura says these viruses could connect the worlds of living things and viruses in new ways.",

    "Viruses are tiny particles that cannot live on their own and need to infect cells to survive. Cells are the basic units of life, and complex cells have a nucleus that controls their activities. Scientists study how life began on Earth, and new discoveries about giant viruses might show that viruses helped create the nucleus in complex cells long ago. This could change our understanding of evolution and how all living things are connected."
