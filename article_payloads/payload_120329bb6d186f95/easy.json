  "title": "Venezuela Changes Oil Rules to Allow More Companies",
  "summary": "Venezuela's acting president, Delcy Rodríguez, signed a new law to change how the country's oil industry works. For over 20 years, the government controlled oil, but now private companies can help produce and sell oil. This happened after the U.S. government started to ease sanctions, which are rules that made it hard for Venezuela to sell oil. The U.S. also said American companies can work in Venezuela, but companies from some other countries like China and Russia cannot. The new law aims to bring more money and jobs by letting foreign companies invest. It also changes taxes and allows disputes to be settled in courts outside Venezuela, which might make companies feel safer. Rodríguez said this is about building a better future for children. This change could help Venezuela's economy grow after years of problems.",
