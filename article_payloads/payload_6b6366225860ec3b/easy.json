  "title": "How Alzheimer's Disease Makes the Brain Forget",
  "summary": "Alzheimer's disease is a sickness that slowly damages the brain, making it hard for people to remember things. Scientists are trying to understand how this happens. They think two things might work together: a protein called amyloid beta and inflammation, which is when the body gets swollen and sore. In a new study, researchers found that both amyloid beta and inflammation can attach to a special part of brain cells called the LilrB2 receptor. This receptor normally helps the brain clean up old connections between cells, which is good for learning. But in Alzheimer's, too much amyloid beta or inflammation tells the brain to remove too many connections, leading to memory loss. The scientists did experiments with mice and discovered that a molecule from inflammation called C4d can also stick to LilrB2 and cause synapse loss. This helps explain why Alzheimer's might trick the brain into erasing its own memories.",

    "Alzheimer's disease is a common brain disorder that mostly affects older adults. It causes problems with memory, thinking, and behavior. Scientists study it to find ways to help people. The brain has many cells called neurons that talk to each other through connections called synapses. In Alzheimer's, these connections get damaged, making it hard to remember things. This article talks about new research that shows how proteins and inflammation might cause this damage by telling the brain to remove too many synapses."
