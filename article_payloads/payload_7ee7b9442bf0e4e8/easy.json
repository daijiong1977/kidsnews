  "title": "Maternity Care Problems in England",
  "summary": "A report in England says that maternity care is not working well for many families. Baroness Amos is leading a review and found six big problems, including racism and not enough staff. Over 8,000 people shared their stories, and she met more than 400 families. The report shows that care is very mixed: some families get good care, but others have bad experiences. Racism is a big issue, with some women being treated unfairly because of their race or religion. For example, Asian women might be called 'princesses' and Black women might be told they can handle pain better. The Health Secretary promises to make changes based on the final report in June. This is important because everyone deserves safe and kind care when having a baby.",
