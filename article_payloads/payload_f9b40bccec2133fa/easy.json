  "title": "Arctic Warming Gets Faster from a Dangerous Loop",
  "summary": "Scientists have found a dangerous loop that is making the Arctic warm up faster. In the Arctic, cracks in sea ice called leads let air rise and form clouds, which can trap heat. Also, pollution from oil fields mixes with salty snow to create chemicals that remove ozone, letting more sunlight in to warm the snow. These two things work together in a feedback loop, meaning they make each other worse, speeding up ice loss and warming. Researchers flew planes and used instruments in Alaska to study this. They learned that human activities like oil drilling are changing the Arctic's air and climate, which could affect the whole planet. This research helps us understand how to protect the Arctic.",

    "The Arctic is a cold area near the North Pole with lots of ice and snow. Scientists study it because it's warming up faster than other places, which can melt ice and raise sea levels. Human activities like burning fuels and drilling for oil release pollution that can change the air and climate. Feedback loops are important in science because they show how things can speed up changes, like how melting ice leads to more warming. This article talks about research done in Alaska to understand these changes better."
