  "title": "Airplanes Get Fixed After Sun Warning",
  "summary": "Thousands of Airbus airplanes were grounded because a warning said solar radiation could mess up their computers. This made some flights delayed or cancelled. Airbus, a big company in France, fixed most planes with a quick software update, but about 900 older planes needed new computers. Officials said the updates went smoothly, and many planes are flying again. In some places like the US, it was harder because it happened during a busy travel time called Thanksgiving. Airlines like American Airlines and Delta had some delays, but in the UK, airports like Heathrow had no big problems. The issue was found after a plane had to emergency land in October, hurting some people. Now, things are getting back to normal.",
