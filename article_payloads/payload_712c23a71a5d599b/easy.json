  "title": "Novak Djokovic Moves Forward in Tennis Tournament",
  "summary": "Novak Djokovic is a famous tennis player who is doing well at the Australian Open, a big tennis tournament. He was supposed to play against Jakub Mensik, but Mensik got hurt and had to leave the tournament. This means Djokovic automatically goes to the next round, called the quarter-finals. He might play against Lorenzo Musetti or Taylor Fritz next. Djokovic is trying to win his 25th Grand Slam title, which would be a new record. Other players like Naomi Osaka have also left the tournament, and it is very hot in Melbourne, which makes playing hard. Djokovic feels good about his game but is being careful not to get too excited early. He learned from last year when he got injured in some tournaments.",
