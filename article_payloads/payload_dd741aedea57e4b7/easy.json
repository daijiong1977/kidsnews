  "title": "Prime Minister and Anonymous Messages",
  "summary": "This article talks about a problem in the UK government. Some people are sending secret messages to the media about the Prime Minister, Sir Keir Starmer. Ed Miliband and Wes Streeting, who are important politicians, are asking the Prime Minister to do something about these messages. They think these messages might be trying to challenge the Prime Minister's leadership. Sir Keir Starmer says he is sure that these messages did not come from his office at 10 Downing Street. This is important because it shows that there might be some disagreements among politicians, and they need to work together to solve problems.",
