  "title": "Serena Williams Might Play Tennis Again",
  "summary": "Serena Williams is a famous tennis player who won many big tournaments. She stopped playing after a match in 2022. Recently, she filled out some papers that might mean she could play again. In an interview, she did not say no to coming back. She joked about it and said she doesn't know what will happen. Players need to be in a testing group for six months before they can compete. Serena's name was on a list for this group. This makes people think she might return to tennis. She is also a mom and said she put 'stay-at-home mom' on a form. Her playful answers keep everyone guessing.",
