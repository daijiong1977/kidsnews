  "title": "Serena Williams Considers a Tennis Comeback After Retirement",
  "summary": "Serena Williams, a legendary tennis player with 23 Grand Slam singles titles, retired after the 2022 US Open. Recently, she filed paperwork that placed her back on the drug testing pool list managed by the International Tennis Integrity Agency, a requirement for returning to competition. In an interview on the Today Show, Williams was evasive when asked about a comeback, saying 'I don't know, I'm just going to see what happens.' She clarified it was not a 'maybe' but did not deny the possibility. Players must spend six months in the testing pool before competing, and Williams' name appeared on an ITIA document in October. She also mentioned listing 'stay-at-home mum and housewife' as her occupation, adding to the speculation. Her playful and cheeky responses suggest she is seriously considering a return, though she has not confirmed anything. This news has sparked interest among fans and media, highlighting the ongoing debate about her future in tennis.",
