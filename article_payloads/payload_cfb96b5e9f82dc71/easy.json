  "title": "What's Happening with Prices and Jobs in the Economy?",
  "summary": "The economy is giving mixed signals right now. Prices are going up more slowly than expected, which is good news because it means inflation is cooling. But at the same time, job growth is weak and unemployment is high, which is bad news for people looking for work. These numbers might lead the Federal Reserve, a group that helps control the economy, to cut interest rates in 2026 to help boost jobs. Austan Goolsbee from the Chicago Fed talked about this on PBS NewsHour. He said the inflation report has a lot to like, but data collection was affected by a government shutdown, so we need to be careful. The Fed has already cut rates three times recently because they are worried about jobs.",

    "The economy is like a big machine that affects everyone. When prices rise too fast (inflation), it makes things expensive. When people can't find jobs (unemployment), it's hard for families. The Federal Reserve is a group that tries to keep the economy stable by adjusting interest rates, which are like the price of borrowing money. Lower rates can encourage spending and hiring. This article talks about recent reports showing mixed signals: good news on prices but bad news on jobs, and what experts like Austan Goolsbee think about it."
