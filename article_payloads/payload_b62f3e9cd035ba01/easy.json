  "title": "New Year Fireworks and Parties in the UK",
  "summary": "People in the UK celebrated the new year with big fireworks and parties. In London, 12,000 fireworks lit up the sky near the Thames River, and 100,000 people watched. Edinburgh Castle had a six-minute firework show with thousands of people at a street party called Hogmanay. The weather was cold with snow and ice warnings in some places. Music from famous singers played during the displays, and events honored sports wins and shows. The London Mayor said the celebrations showed how important it is to be together. Other cities like Belfast and Cardiff also had parties. Edinburgh's party was special because last year's event was canceled due to bad weather, so they used some old fireworks this time. Families, like one with a seven-year-old boy, enjoyed the fun.",
