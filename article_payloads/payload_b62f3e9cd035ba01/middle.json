In London, Europe's biggest firework show featured 12,000 pyrotechnics along the Thames, attended by 100,000 spectators, with music from artists like Raye and Coldplay, and acknowledgments of achievements such as England's Women's Rugby World Cup win.

In the UK, major cities host elaborate events: London's display along the Thames is renowned for its scale and technological prowess, while Edinburgh's Hogmanay is a historic Scottish festival with roots in pagan customs.
