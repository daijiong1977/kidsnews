  "title": "Sir Idris Elba Gets a Fine for Scooter Speeding",
  "summary": "Sir Idris Elba, a famous actor and DJ, got a fine for going too fast on his scooter in London. He was riding on Chelsea Embankment where the speed limit is 20 miles per hour, but he was caught going 28 miles per hour in June. The police used a speed camera to take pictures of him. He had to pay £147 as a fine, plus other costs, and got three penalty points on his driving licence. Sir Idris said he did not get the first fine notice in the mail, so he could not pay it. His lawyers explained this in court, and he admitted to the speeding. He did not have to go to court because it was handled quickly with written evidence. Sir Idris is known for his charity work and was knighted recently.",
