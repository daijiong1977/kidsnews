  "title": "Ukraine and U.S. Work on Peace Plan",
  "summary": "The United States and Ukraine are trying to make a peace plan to stop the war that has been going on for almost four years. The U.S. had a plan with 28 points, but people were worried it was too hard for Ukraine because it included things like limiting Ukraine's army and giving up land. Now, the plan has been changed to 19 points, and both sides are talking to make it better. They are working together to find a solution that Ukraine can agree to. The U.S. says they are hopeful that they can make progress and end the fighting. This is important because it could help bring peace to the region and stop the suffering caused by the war.",

    "The war in Ukraine started almost four years ago when Russia invaded. Many countries, including the U.S., are trying to help stop the fighting. A peace plan is a set of ideas to end the war, but it must be fair to both sides. Ukraine wants to protect its land and people, while the U.S. is helping to find a solution that everyone can agree on. This is important for world peace and safety."
