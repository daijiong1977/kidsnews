  "title": "Japan's Election Day: Prime Minister Hopes for Victory",
  "summary": "In Japan, people are voting in an important election on Sunday. Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi is hoping her party, the Liberal Democratic Party, wins big. She is the first female leader of Japan and is very popular. Her party has been in charge for many years but is not as liked now. She wants to make Japan stronger by improving the economy and military, especially because of tensions with China. She also works closely with the United States. Recent polls show her party might win a lot of seats in parliament. If they don't win enough, she says she will quit. A big win could lead to changes in Japan's policies on security and immigration.",
