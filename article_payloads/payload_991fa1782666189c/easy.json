  "title": "Making Graphene Better with Tiny Mistakes",
  "summary": "Scientists have found a cool way to make graphene, a super-strong material made of carbon atoms, even better by adding tiny mistakes called defects on purpose. Usually, defects are bad because they make materials weaker, but in this case, they help graphene stick to other things better, which is useful for making sensors to detect gases or for electronics. The researchers used a special molecule called Azupyrene to grow graphene with these defects in one step. They worked together from universities in the UK and used big machines to see the atoms and check their work. This could help make better batteries and gadgets in the future.",

    "Graphene is a material discovered in 2004 that is very thin, strong, and conducts electricity well. It is made of carbon atoms arranged in a flat sheet, like a honeycomb. Scientists often try to make it better for use in things like phones, computers, and medical devices. In this article, they added small mistakes on purpose to make it more useful."
