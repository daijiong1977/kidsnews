  "title": "New Rules for Asylum Seekers' Travel",
  "summary": "The government has announced that asylum seekers will no longer be allowed to use taxis for medical appointments starting in February. This decision comes after a BBC investigation found that some asylum seekers were taking very long taxi rides, like one that cost £600 for a 250-mile trip to see a doctor. The government says it spends a lot of money on this transport, about £15.8 million each year. Taxi drivers shared stories of short trips that cost a lot because of poor planning. The Home Secretary, Shabana Mahmood, says this will stop waste and abuse, and taxis will only be used in very special cases. Asylum seekers will still have bus passes for some travel.",

    "Asylum seekers are people who come to the UK to ask for protection because it's not safe in their home country. The government provides them with places to stay, like hotels, and helps with travel to important appointments, such as seeing a doctor. Taxis are sometimes used for this, but they can be expensive. The Home Office is part of the government that manages immigration and asylum. This article talks about new rules to reduce costs by limiting taxi use."
