    "This article is about a bodyguard for a politician's family who got into legal trouble. In the United States, drug trafficking is a serious crime where people are accused of selling or moving illegal drugs. Politicians often hire private companies to protect their families from harm. Background checks are tests to see if someone has a good history before they get a job. When someone is arrested, it means the police think they broke the law, and they might go to jail if found guilty. This story shows how even people in trusted jobs can face problems, and it's important for families to stay safe."
