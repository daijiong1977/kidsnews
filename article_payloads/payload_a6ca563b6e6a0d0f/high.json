  "title": "Navigating the Erosion of the Post-WW2 Liberal Order: Challenges for Middle Powers",
  "summary": "This article critically examines the post-World War 2 international liberal order, established under US hegemony through mechanisms like the Marshall Plan and containment of Soviet expansion. It recounts a 2002 keynote speech at Columbia University, where the speaker, reflecting on post-9/11 vulnerability, praised America's role in fostering a rules-based system that ensured security and prosperity in the West. However, the narrative incorporates a counterpoint from a Pakistani student who analogized the US to Imperial Rome, arguing that American power is perceived as hegemonic and unaccountable in the Global South, where international law and trade rules are applied asymmetrically. This dichotomy underscores the article's central thesis: the rules-based order is inherently flawed, with benefits disproportionately accruing to Western nations, while middle powers face heightened challenges as the world reverts to a pre-WW2 multipolar dynamic characterized by great power competition and eroded institutional trust. The piece suggests a need for reevaluation of global governance structures in light of these persistent inequities.",

    "The post-World War 2 liberal international order, underpinned by US hegemony, was characterized by institutions like the UN, Bretton Woods system, and NATO, aimed at preventing conflict through rules-based cooperation. The Marshall Plan exemplified US efforts to rebuild Europe and contain communism, fostering Western alignment. However, critiques from postcolonial and Global South scholars argue this order perpetuated neo-imperial inequalities, with asymmetrical enforcement of trade agreements and international law favoring Western interests. The end of the Cold War and events like 9/11 exposed vulnerabilities, while rising powers like China challenge US unipolarity, leading to a multipolar shift. Middle powers, such as Canada or Australia, must navigate this complex landscape where institutional erosion and great power rivalry threaten global stability, requiring adaptive diplomacy to address persistent governance gaps and inequities."
