  "title": "Tennis Players Push for Fair Pay and Influence in Grand Slams",
  "summary": "As the Grand Slam season begins, top-10 tennis players, including world number one Aryna Sabalenka and Wimbledon champion Jannik Sinner, are advocating for increased prize money and greater involvement in tournament decisions. Despite recent raises, such as a 16% increase at the Australian Open, players argue they are undervalued compared to tournament revenues. They have launched Project RedEye, a campaign led by former WTA chairman Larry Scott, and sent letters to Grand Slams demanding specific changes. For instance, they request that Slams pay 22% of revenue in prize money by 2030, matching commitments from ATP and WTA Tour events. Players like Jessica Pegula emphasize the physical and emotional toll of majors, calling for contributions to welfare benefits. This movement highlights ongoing tensions between players and tournament organizers over fair compensation and representation.",

    "Tennis is a global sport with professional tours run by the ATP (men) and WTA (women). Grand Slams are the most prestigious tournaments, offering the highest prize money and attracting top players. In recent years, players have raised concerns about fair compensation, arguing that tournament revenues have grown significantly while prize money increases have not kept pace. This has led to organized efforts, such as Project RedEye, where players collaborate to negotiate for better terms, including revenue sharing and input on scheduling. Understanding these dynamics helps explain the current debates over player rights and tournament economics in tennis."
