  "title": "Tennis Stars Want More Money and a Voice",
  "summary": "Top tennis players like Aryna Sabalenka and Jannik Sinner are asking for more prize money and a bigger say in decisions at big tournaments called Grand Slams. Even though prize money has increased, such as at the Australian Open, players feel they are not getting enough. They want tournaments to pay them a fair share of the money they earn. Players have sent letters and had meetings to talk about this. They are working together in a campaign to make things better for all tennis players.",
