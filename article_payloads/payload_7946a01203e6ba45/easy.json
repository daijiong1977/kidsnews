  "title": "Heart Risk Starts Earlier for Men",
  "summary": "A big study found that men start having heart problems earlier than women, sometimes as young as their 30s. Heart disease can lead to heart attacks and takes many years to develop. Doctors tracked over 5,000 adults for more than 30 years to see when heart disease risk begins. They discovered that men reach a 5% risk of heart disease about seven years before women do. This means men might need check-ups and healthy habits sooner to stay safe. The study suggests looking at more than just things like blood pressure to understand why this happens. It was published in a medical journal to help people learn about heart health.",

    "Heart disease is a common health problem where the heart doesn't work well, often because of things like not eating healthy or not exercising. It can cause serious issues like heart attacks, where the heart stops pumping blood properly. Doctors do studies to learn how to prevent it by tracking people over time. This helps them give advice on staying healthy, like eating fruits and vegetables and being active."
