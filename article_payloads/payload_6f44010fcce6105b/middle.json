  "title": "School Maintenance Crisis: PFI Contract Fallout in Stoke-on-Trent",
  "summary": "At Trentham Academy in Stoke-on-Trent, students faced extreme cold during mock exams due to a broken heating system, highlighting broader issues with Private Finance Initiative (PFI) contracts. These contracts, signed 25 years ago by the city council, involved private companies like Transform Schools (Stoke) Ltd maintaining school buildings for profit. As one of 88 local schools under this PFI, Trentham's contract ended in October, but vital repairs worth £24m-£30m were incomplete. The company went into liquidation shortly after, leaving the council to address safety concerns with £3.5m in public funds. A BBC investigation revealed that repair work slowed in the contract's final year, with jobs marked as closed without being fixed. Students reported difficulties concentrating and writing in the cold, bundled in extra clothing. This situation reflects a national challenge, as around 660 similar PFI contracts across the UK begin to expire, risking unfinished repairs and financial burdens on public authorities.",

    "Private Finance Initiatives (PFI) are contracts used in the UK since the 1990s, often under Labour governments, to fund public infrastructure projects like schools and hospitals. Private companies invest in building and maintenance, receiving payments over 25-30 years. While intended to reduce immediate public spending, PFIs have faced criticism for high long-term costs and risks, such as companies failing to deliver. In Stoke-on-Trent, a PFI contract for 88 schools ended recently, exposing issues like incomplete repairs and company liquidation. This highlights broader debates about privatization in public services and the role of local councils in ensuring school safety and quality education during contract transitions."
