  "title": "Cold Classrooms: School Repairs Left Unfinished",
  "summary": "At Trentham Academy, a school in Stoke-on-Trent, students are shivering during exams because the heating system is broken. This happened because a contract with a private company to fix the school ended before repairs were done. The company, called Transform Schools (Stoke) Ltd, went out of business, leaving many problems like barricaded swimming pools and cold classrooms. The city council had to use public money to try to make schools safe and warm. Students like Esme and Sam found it hard to concentrate and write in the cold. This is part of a bigger issue with similar contracts across the UK, where schools might not get fixed on time.",

    "In the UK, schools sometimes use contracts called Private Finance Initiatives (PFI) where private companies are paid to maintain buildings. These contracts can last for many years, but if they end before repairs are done, schools might be left with problems like broken heating. This can affect students' learning, especially during important times like exams. Local governments, like city councils, may need to step in to fix things using public money from taxes."
