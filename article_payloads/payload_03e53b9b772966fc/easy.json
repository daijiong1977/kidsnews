Now they are in a new film called Crime 101, which is a thriller about a thief and a detective. In the movie, Chris plays a jewel thief, and Mark plays a detective trying to catch him. They are good friends and like to have fun on set, but this movie is more serious than their past ones. They had to work hard to act in a dramatic way instead of being funny.
