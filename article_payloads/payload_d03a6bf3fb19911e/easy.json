  "title": "U.S. Changes How It Helps Friends Stay Safe",
  "summary": "The United States is changing its plan to help other countries stay safe. The Pentagon, which is part of the U.S. government that handles defense, says it will give \"more limited\" support to allies like friends in Europe. This means the U.S. wants these friends to do more to protect themselves instead of always relying on America. The new plan focuses on keeping the U.S. homeland and nearby areas safe as the top priority, not China. It says allies should lead in fighting threats that are bigger problems for them, like Russia for Europe. The U.S. is not becoming isolated but wants to be more focused on its own interests. For example, South Korea is told it can handle North Korea mostly by itself. This shift comes from President Trump's calls for allies to share more of the defense burden.",

    "The United States has many friends around the world called allies, like countries in Europe and Asia. For a long time, the U.S. has helped these allies stay safe from dangers like wars or attacks. The Pentagon makes plans every few years to decide how to protect the country and its friends. Recently, under President Trump, there is a new idea: allies should do more to protect themselves so America can focus on its own safety first. This is called a shift in defense strategy, meaning a change in how things are done. It doesn't mean the U.S. is leaving its friends, but it wants them to share the work better."
