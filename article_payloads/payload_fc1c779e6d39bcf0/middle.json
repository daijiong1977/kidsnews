  "title": "Chancellor Reverses Income Tax Increase Plans",
  "summary": "The chancellor, who oversees the country's finances, was anticipated to raise income tax rates in the upcoming budget, which would have violated a key manifesto commitment. However, after public and political scrutiny, the decision has been reversed. Income tax is a direct tax levied on individuals' earnings, and increasing it could have reduced disposable income for many households. This move aims to uphold the government's electoral promises and maintain economic stability. The budget is a financial plan outlining government revenue and expenditure. By stepping back from the tax hike, the chancellor addresses concerns about trust and fairness, highlighting the balance between fiscal needs and public expectations in policy-making.",

    "The chancellor is a high-ranking official in the government, often in charge of the treasury, responsible for setting tax policies and managing the national budget. Income tax is a major source of government revenue, calculated as a percentage of individual earnings. Manifestos are critical in democracies, as they outline parties' intentions and hold them accountable. Breaking a manifesto promise can lead to public distrust and political fallout. Budgets detail how money is collected and spent on services like healthcare and education. This article discusses a policy reversal, showing how economic decisions are influenced by public opinion and electoral commitments."
