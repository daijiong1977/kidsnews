  "title": "Amber Davies Addresses Criticism Ahead of Strictly Come Dancing Final",
  "summary": "As the Strictly Come Dancing final approaches, three remaining couples—Amber Davies with Nikita Kuzmin, George Clarke, and Karen Carney with Carlos Gu—are preparing for the last dance to win the glitterball trophy. The final marks the end of an era as presenters Tess Daly and Claudia Winkleman step down after this series. A key issue in the lead-up is the debate over Amber Davies' performing background, including roles in West End musicals and participation in Dancing on Ice, which some viewers argue gives her an unfair edge. At a press conference, Amber acknowledged her experience but emphasized that she has worked equally hard to reach the final, stating that love outweighs the hate. This controversy reflects a broader pattern on Strictly, where past contestants like Lewis Cope and JB Gill also faced scrutiny for prior performance experience. Meanwhile, Karen Carney, the first footballer to make the final, expressed pride and personal growth through the show. The grand final will air on BBC One and iPlayer, highlighting themes of hard work, public perception, and the value of overcoming challenges in entertainment competitions.",
