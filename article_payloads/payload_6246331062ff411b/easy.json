  "summary": "The Strictly Come Dancing final is coming soon, and three celebrities are competing to win the glitterball trophy. Amber Davies, one of the finalists, has been talking about how hard she has worked.

The show is presented by Tess Daly and Claudia Winkleman, who are leaving after this series. Other finalists include George Clarke and Karen Carney, who is a footballer and feels proud to be in the final. The final will be on TV on Saturday.",
