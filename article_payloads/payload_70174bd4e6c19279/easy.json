  "title": "A Health Problem That Connects Your Heart, Kidneys, and Body Energy",
  "summary": "Many adults in the U.S. have a health issue called CKM syndrome, which stands for cardiovascular-kidney-metabolic syndrome. This means problems with the heart, kidneys, and how the body uses energy can happen together, making people sicker. Nearly 90% of adults have at least one risk factor, like high blood pressure or being overweight. When these issues combine, they can lead to serious problems like heart attacks or strokes. The good news is that people can improve their health by eating better, exercising, and getting medical help. A survey found that most people haven't heard of CKM syndrome but want to learn more. The American Heart Association is creating tools to teach everyone about it and help them stay healthy.",

    "CKM syndrome is a new term that doctors use to describe when someone has problems with their heart, kidneys, and how their body uses energy all at once. This is important because many people have risk factors like high blood pressure or being overweight, and when these combine, they can make you very sick. Learning about it can help you stay healthy by making good choices like eating fruits and vegetables, playing outside, and visiting the doctor for check-ups. The American Heart Association is a trusted group that teaches people about heart health and is creating fun videos and tools to explain CKM syndrome in simple ways."
