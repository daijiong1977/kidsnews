  "title": "The Science of Beer Foam: Why Some Foams Last Longer",
  "summary": "Scientists at ETH Zurich studied why some beers have foam that stays on top longer than others. They looked at different types of Belgian beers like Tripel, Dubbel, and Singel, and found that Tripel beers have the most stable foam. Foam is made of tiny bubbles, and proteins from barley malt help keep the bubbles from popping quickly. In some beers, the way proteins work with the bubble surfaces makes the foam stronger. The researchers used experiments to learn this over seven years, and their findings can help brewers make better beer with lasting foam. This study shows how science can solve everyday problems in fun ways.",

    "Beer is a popular drink made from ingredients like barley, hops, and water. Foam is the white, bubbly top that many people enjoy because it adds to the experience. Scientists study how things work in nature, and in this case, they looked at beer foam to understand why it lasts longer in some beers. This helps brewers improve their recipes and make beer that people like even more."
