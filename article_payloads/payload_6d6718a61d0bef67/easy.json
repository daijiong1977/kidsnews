  "title": "Ancient Humans Learned to Make Fire Long Ago",
  "summary": "Scientists found that ancient humans might have learned to make fire much earlier than we thought. They discovered evidence in England that shows people were making fire around 400,000 years ago. Before this, the oldest known fire-making was only 50,000 years ago. The scientists found baked clay, hot-broken tools, and special rocks that make sparks when hit together. They studied the site for four years to make sure it wasn't from a natural fire like lightning. This tells us that early humans were smart and could control fire to help them survive. Fire was important for cooking, warmth, and protection, and this discovery helps us understand how humans evolved over time.",

    "Ancient humans, also called early people, lived thousands of years ago and had to find ways to survive without modern tools. Fire was a big discovery because it let them cook food, stay warm in cold weather, and scare away dangerous animals. Scientists study old sites to learn about how these humans lived. This article talks about a new find in England that shows humans might have learned to make fire much earlier than we knew, which helps us understand how smart and creative they were."
