  "title": "A New Way to Recycle Plastic Better",
  "summary": "Scientists have found a new material called tungsten carbide that can help recycle plastic and other chemicals much better than expensive metals like platinum. Platinum is used in many products but costs a lot and is hard to find. Tungsten carbide is cheaper and more common, but it was tricky to use because its atoms can arrange in different ways, making it unpredictable. Researchers from the University of Rochester, led by Professor Marc Porosoff, figured out how to control these atoms to make tungsten carbide work well. They tested it in reactions that turn carbon dioxide into useful stuff and break down plastic waste into new materials. This could make recycling plastic 10 times more efficient, helping reduce waste and save money. The team hopes this discovery will lead to better ways to reuse plastic bottles and other items.",

    "Plastic is a common material used in bottles and packaging, but it often ends up as waste. Recycling helps turn old plastic into new products, but it can be expensive and not very efficient. Scientists are always looking for better ways to recycle, using materials that are cheap and easy to find. This article talks about a new discovery that could make recycling much better and help our planet."
