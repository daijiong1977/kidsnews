  "title": "James Webb Telescope Finds an Old Galaxy with a Bar",
  "summary": "Scientists using the James Webb Space Telescope have discovered a very old galaxy called COSMOS-74706 that has a special feature called a stellar bar. This galaxy existed about 11.5 billion years ago, which is very early in the universe's history. A stellar bar is a bright, straight line made of stars and gas in the center of a spiral galaxy, like our Milky Way. The bar helps move gas from the outer parts to the center, which can feed a black hole and change how stars form. The team, led by Daniel Ivanov, used precise measurements to confirm this finding, making it one of the earliest known barred spiral galaxies. This discovery helps us understand how galaxies grow and change over time.",

    "Galaxies are like big cities in space made of stars, gas, and dust. Our galaxy is called the Milky Way, and it has a bar in its center too. Scientists use telescopes to look at galaxies far away to learn how they formed and changed over billions of years. The James Webb Space Telescope is a new tool that helps see very old galaxies because it can detect faint light from long ago. Understanding bars in galaxies helps us know how galaxies grow and why some have black holes at their centers."
