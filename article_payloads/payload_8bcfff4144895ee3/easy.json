  "title": "A Charity Closes After News About a Friend",
  "summary": "Sarah Ferguson's charity, called Sarah's Trust, is closing down. This happened a few days after new information came out about her friendship with Jeffrey Epstein, who was a bad person. The charity was started in 2020 to help people with hunger and poverty. A spokesman said they decided to close after talking about it for months. Last year, other charities stopped working with Sarah Ferguson because of her connection to Epstein. The new information includes emails and pictures, but being named does not mean she did anything wrong. The charity did not say exactly why it is closing.",

    "Sarah Ferguson is a former duchess who used to be married to Prince Andrew. She started a charity to help people who are hungry or poor. Recently, news came out about her friendship with Jeffrey Epstein, who was in trouble for bad things. This made some other charities stop working with her last year. Now, her own charity is closing, but we do not know all the reasons why. It is important to remember that being named in news does not always mean someone did something wrong."
