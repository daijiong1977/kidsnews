    "Opioids are medicines that help with pain but have caused addiction and health issues for many people. Purdue Pharma made some of these medicines and faced lawsuits. A bankruptcy court helps companies that can't pay their debts. Immigration laws control who can enter a country, and sometimes the government sends agents to enforce them. Airlines sometimes delay flights, and there were plans to make them pay passengers, but that was dropped."
