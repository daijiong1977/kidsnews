  "title": "Sunrise at Stonehenge on the Shortest Day",
  "summary": "Thousands of people went to Stonehenge in England to see the sunrise on the winter solstice, which is the shortest day of the year. The sun came up just after 8:00 in the morning. About 8,500 visitors were there, and some did special rituals to celebrate. One family woke up very early at 2:00 to drive from Nottingham to be part of it. A girl named Bella said it was nice to dress up and show respect because it is a ceremony. After this day, the days start to get longer and we have more daylight. Stonehenge is a historic site where people have gathered for a long time to mark this event.",
