  "title": "What Happens After the Government Changes a Climate Rule?",
  "summary": "The Trump administration is removing an old rule that said greenhouse gases are bad for people's health. This rule was made by the EPA, a government group that protects the environment. By taking it away, the EPA says it cannot make laws to stop pollution from cars and factories anymore. Scientists say greenhouse gases cause climate change, leading to hotter weather, more storms, and wildfires. Some people, like former EPA workers and Democrats, are upset and will fight this change in court. They worry it will make air dirtier and harm communities. The Supreme Court might have to decide if this is allowed. This move is part of Trump's plan to use more coal and reduce rules on energy.",

    "Climate change is when the Earth's weather gets warmer over time, often because of gases like carbon dioxide from cars and factories. The EPA is a U.S. government group that makes rules to protect the environment. In 2009, they said greenhouse gases are dangerous to health, which let them make laws to reduce pollution. Now, the Trump administration is removing that rule, which could lead to more pollution and health problems. People are arguing about this in courts to see if it's fair."
