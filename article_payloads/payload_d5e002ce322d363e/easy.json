  "title": "Do Trees Feel a Solar Eclipse? Scientists Disagree",
  "summary": "Scientists studied trees in Italy to see if they could sense a solar eclipse. They attached sensors to three spruce trees and five stumps in a forest. During a partial solar eclipse in 2022, the sensors recorded more electrical activity in the trees, which peaked in the middle of the eclipse. The researchers thought this meant the trees were responding together to the darkening sky, with older trees showing stronger activity, possibly because they remembered past eclipses. However, other scientists criticized this study. They said the sample size was too small and that factors like temperature changes or lightning could explain the electrical spikes. They argued that trees experience bigger light changes from clouds every day, so a small eclipse shouldn't matter. Some called the claims pseudoscience, meaning fake science, and warned about poorly designed studies in plant research. The debate shows how scientists check each other's work to find the truth.",

    "A solar eclipse happens when the moon moves between the Earth and the sun, blocking sunlight for a short time. Trees are living things that can respond to their environment, like growing toward light. Scientists use sensors to study how plants react to changes, but they must be careful to avoid mistakes. When researchers publish studies, other scientists review them to check if the evidence is strong. This process helps keep science accurate and trustworthy."
