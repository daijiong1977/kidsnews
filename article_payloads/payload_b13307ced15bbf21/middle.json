  "title": "Advancements in Stretchable OLED Technology for Wearables",
  "summary": "Researchers have made significant progress in developing stretchable OLED displays, which could revolutionize wearable technology by enabling devices that adhere directly to the skin. An international team led by Seoul National University and Drexel University created a flexible OLED that stretches up to 1.6 times its original length while maintaining brightness, addressing durability issues in existing flexible screens. Published in Nature, the study introduces a redesigned OLED combining a phosphorescent polymer layer with MXene-based electrodes. This innovation overcomes limitations where repeated bending caused brightness loss due to electrode damage. The new design uses an exciplex-assisted phosphorescent (ExciPh) layer to boost light efficiency and incorporates thermoplastic polyurethane for flexibility. MXene electrodes, combined with silver nanowires, enhance conductivity and durability. This advancement paves the way for real-time health monitoring displays, such as showing temperature or blood flow changes, and marks a leap forward from current flexible OLEDs used in smartphones and TVs.",
