  "title": "Stretchy Screens for Wearable Tech",
  "summary": "Scientists have made a big step forward in creating stretchy screens that can bend and stretch without breaking. These screens, called OLEDs, are used in phones and TVs, but now they might be used in wearable devices like smartwatches or health monitors that stick to your skin. A team from Seoul National University and Drexel University developed a new type of OLED that can stretch up to 1.6 times its original length and stay bright. They used special materials like MXene and a stretchy polymer layer to make it work better. This could help show real-time information like temperature or blood flow on your skin. The research was published in a science journal called Nature, and it solves problems with old flexible screens that lost brightness when bent too much.",

    "OLED stands for Organic Light-Emitting Diode, a type of screen technology that creates light when electricity passes through organic materials. It's used in many devices because it can be thin and flexible. Wearable technology includes items like fitness trackers or smart glasses that people wear to get information. Scientists often work in teams from different universities to solve big problems, like making screens more durable for new uses."
