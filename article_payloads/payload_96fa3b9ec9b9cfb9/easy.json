  "title": "Old Boats Become a New Home for Birds",
  "summary": "In the UK, some old boats called Thames barges have been sunk in an estuary to make a new island for birds. These barges used to carry things like coal and food long ago. Now, they are filled with mud and placed in the Blackwater Estuary in Essex. This helps stop the land from washing away and gives birds like dunlin, curlew, ringed plover, and lapwing a safe place to live. The National Trust, a group that cares for nature, did this project. They say it is like recycling the boats to help wildlife. The island is about as big as a football pitch and will protect birds that are in danger. This is a creative way to use old things to help nature and fight rising sea levels.",

    "The Blackwater Estuary is a place in England where rivers meet the sea, and it has mudflats and saltmarshes that are home to many birds. Erosion happens when water washes away the land, which can be bad for animals. The National Trust works to protect nature and history in the UK. Birds like dunlin and curlew are endangered, meaning there are not many left, so they need safe places to live. This project uses old boats to help solve these problems in a fun and creative way."
