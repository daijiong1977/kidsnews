  "title": "Baby Dinosaurs Were Important Food for Predators",
  "summary": "A new study shows that baby sauropods, which were long-necked plant-eating dinosaurs, were very important for feeding meat-eating dinosaurs during the Late Jurassic period, about 150 million years ago. These baby dinosaurs were small and had no good defenses, so they were easy for predators like Allosaurus to catch. Fossils from a place called the Morrison Formation in the United States helped scientists learn this. The study used fossils to make a food web, which is like a map showing who eats whom. Even though adult sauropods were huge, their babies were tiny and not protected by their parents, similar to baby turtles today. This made them a key part of the food chain, helping predators survive. The research helps us understand how dinosaur ecosystems worked and why dinosaurs evolved in certain ways.",

    "Dinosaurs lived millions of years ago during a time called the Jurassic period. Sauropods were a group of dinosaurs with long necks and tails that ate plants. They started as tiny babies but grew into the biggest land animals ever. Predators like Allosaurus hunted other dinosaurs for food. Fossils are remains of these ancient animals that scientists study to learn about their lives. A food web shows how all living things in an area are connected by what they eat, helping us see how ecosystems work."
