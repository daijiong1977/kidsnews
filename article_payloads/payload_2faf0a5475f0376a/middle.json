  "title": "KATRIN Experiment Narrows Search for Elusive Sterile Neutrino",
  "summary": "Physicists are investigating the possibility of a sterile neutrino, a hypothetical fourth type of neutrino that would interact even more weakly than the three known types. Neutrinos are abundant particles in the universe, and their ability to oscillate between types indicates they have mass. The KATRIN experiment in Germany conducted a precise search for sterile neutrinos by analyzing tritium β-decay. Tritium decays release electrons, and if a sterile neutrino were produced, it would cause a distortion in the electron energy spectrum. KATRIN recorded about 36 million electrons over 259 days with high accuracy, finding no evidence of sterile neutrinos. This result contradicts earlier anomalies from reactor experiments and the Neutrino-4 experiment, which had hinted at such a particle. KATRIN's method complements other experiments by examining energy distribution at neutrino creation, unlike oscillation studies. The collaboration plans to continue data collection through 2025 and add the TRISTAN detector in 2026 to enhance sensitivity. This research helps refine our understanding of particle physics and the Standard Model.",

    "Neutrinos are fundamental particles that are challenging to detect due to their weak interactions with matter. The Standard Model of particle physics includes three types: electron, muon, and tau neutrinos. Neutrino oscillations, discovered through experiments, revealed that neutrinos have mass and can transform between types. Sterile neutrinos are a proposed extension to explain anomalies in data, such as deficits in reactor experiments. Experiments like KATRIN use precise measurements of radioactive decay to test these ideas, contributing to our understanding of physics beyond the Standard Model."
