  "title": "Scientists Search for a Hidden Particle Called Sterile Neutrino",
  "summary": "Scientists are trying to find a special particle called a sterile neutrino. Neutrinos are tiny particles that are everywhere in space, and we know three types. But some experiments showed strange results, so scientists think there might be a fourth type called sterile neutrino. A big experiment called KATRIN in Germany looked for it by studying how tritium, a type of hydrogen, decays and releases electrons. They measured millions of electrons very carefully but did not find any signs of the sterile neutrino. This means the sterile neutrino probably does not exist in the way scientists thought. KATRIN will keep searching with more data and new equipment to be sure. Finding or not finding this particle helps us understand how the universe works.",

    "Neutrinos are tiny, invisible particles that flow through space and everything around us. They are very hard to detect because they rarely interact with other matter. Scientists use big machines like KATRIN to study them by watching how materials like tritium break down and release energy. Understanding neutrinos helps us learn about the basic building blocks of the universe and how it works."
