  "title": "Taylor Swift Stops a Bedding Company from Using Her Name",
  "summary": "A company called Cathay Home wanted to use the name \"Swift Home\" for their bedding products, but Taylor Swift, a famous singer, did not like this. She told the US government to stop the company because the name was too similar to her own. Taylor Swift has her name trademarked, which means she owns it for things like bedding and clothes. She worried that people might think she was supporting the bedding, which she was not. The company decided to drop the application over the weekend because the name was not very important to their business. They had also made an agreement with Taylor Swift before about another similar name. This shows how celebrities protect their brands to avoid confusion.",
