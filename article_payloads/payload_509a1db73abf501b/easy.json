  "title": "Moon Rocks Show a Big Crash Changed the Moon Inside",
  "summary": "Scientists studied rocks from the Moon brought back by China's Chang'e-6 mission. These rocks came from a huge crater called the South Pole-Aitken Basin, which was made by a giant asteroid hitting the Moon long ago. The rocks have a special chemical called potassium that is heavier than in other Moon rocks. This tells us that the big crash was so hot it made potassium evaporate and change. This event affected the Moon's inside, making less lava flow on the far side of the Moon. The study helps us understand how big impacts can change planets and moons in our solar system.",
