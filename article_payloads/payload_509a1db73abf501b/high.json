  "title": "Isotopic Analysis of Chang'e-6 Basalts Demonstrates Profound Interior Modification from the South Pole-Aitken Impact",
  "summary": "A research team led by Prof. Hengci Tian conducted an isotopic investigation of lunar basalt samples retrieved by the Chang'e-6 mission from the South Pole-Aitken Basin. Utilizing sapphire collision-cell multicollector inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (MC-ICP-MS), they measured potassium isotopes, finding elevated δ41K values (mean: 0.038 ± 0.044‰) compared to Apollo basalts (-0.13 ± 0.06‰). This enrichment signifies substantial volatile loss during the colossal impact that formed the basin, as potassium, a moderately volatile element, fractionates under extreme temperatures. The researchers systematically eliminated confounding factors—cosmic ray exposure, magma evolution, and meteoritic contamination—confirming the impact as the primary driver. Computer simulations corroborated that the event induced deep-seated thermal convection, altering the lunar mantle's dynamics. Consequently, this volatile depletion likely suppressed magmatism on the far side, elucidating the hemispheric asymmetry in lunar volcanism. Published in PNAS, the study underscores that mega-impacts can irrevocably modify the internal chemical and thermal evolution of terrestrial bodies, with implications for understanding planetary formation across the solar system.",
