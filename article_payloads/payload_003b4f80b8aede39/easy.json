The International Olympic Committee president said Italy did a great job and set a high standard for future games. Italy won 30 medals, which is their best ever in the Winter Olympics. The next Winter Games will be in France in 2030, and they will also use many different places for events. The closing ceremony had music, dancing, and celebrations to honor Italy's culture.",
