  "title": "Talking About Peace in Gaza",
  "summary": "This article is about a talk with Ambassador Mike Huckabee, who works for the United States in Israel. He discusses what happens next in Gaza after a ceasefire, which is a time when fighting stops. The ceasefire has helped people in Israel feel safer because there are no more missiles. All hostages, who were people taken during the conflict, have been returned. Now, the focus is on rebuilding Gaza and making sure it is peaceful. A new group called the Board of Peace is starting, and a government is being formed. However, there is still work to do, like disarming Hamas, a group involved in the conflict. The article also mentions that the Rafah Crossing, a border area, has reopened, but not many sick people can leave yet. The ambassador explains that progress is slow but happening step by step.",
