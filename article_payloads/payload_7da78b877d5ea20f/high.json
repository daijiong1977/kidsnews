  "title": "Engineering Subnanometer Pores: Implications for DNA Sequencing and Neuromorphic Systems",
  "summary": "A team from The University of Osaka has pioneered a method to fabricate atom-sized gates through electrochemical deposition within a silicon nitride membrane, achieving subnanometer pores that emulate biological ion channels. By applying negative voltage, a solid precipitate forms to block a nanopore, and reversing the voltage dissolves it, enabling reversible opening and closing cycles. Electrical current analysis revealed spikes indicative of multiple ultrasmall pores, with tunability via chemical composition and pH adjustments for selective ion transport. This innovation addresses the nanoscale challenge of reproducing angstrom-scale structures and offers profound applications: in DNA sequencing, it could enhance single-molecule sensing by nanopores; in neuromorphic computing, it facilitates the simulation of neural spikes; and in nanoreactors, it enables confined reaction environments. The robust, controllable process, documented in Nature Communications, advances fundamental understanding of ion dynamics and holds promise for transformative technologies in biotechnology and computing.",
