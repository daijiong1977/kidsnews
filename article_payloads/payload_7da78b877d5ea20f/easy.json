  "title": "Tiny Gates for DNA and Brain Computers",
  "summary": "Scientists at The University of Osaka have made tiny gates as small as atoms! These gates are like doors that control tiny particles called ions, just like in our bodies. They used a special machine to build these small gates in a thin material. By changing electricity, they can open and close the gates many times. This helps study how ions move and could be used for reading DNA like a book or making computers work like brains. The gates are very small and can be adjusted by changing the liquids used. This discovery is exciting for new technologies.",

    "This article is about a scientific discovery where researchers created tiny gates that mimic natural ion channels in living things. Ion channels are like doors in cells that let ions pass through, helping with functions like nerve signals. The scientists used electricity and chemicals to make these gates in a lab, which can open and close repeatedly. This could lead to new ways to study DNA or build brain-like computers, making it an exciting step in technology for kids to learn about science and innovation."
