  "title": "Snow and Ice Warnings for the UK",
  "summary": "After lots of rain, cold weather is coming back to the UK. Snow and ice warnings are in place for Scotland and northern England from Thursday to Friday. Arctic air will make temperatures drop, and rain will turn to snow, especially on higher ground. Up to 10cm of snow might pile up above 200m. When the snow clears, it will get very cold, causing ice on roads and making driving dangerous. Health alerts are also issued to help protect vulnerable people from the cold. By Tuesday, temperatures should go back to normal. Remember to stay safe in the snow and ice!",
