  "title": "Scientists Make Tiny Twisty Crystals to Control Electricity",
  "summary": "Scientists have found a cool way to build tiny 3D shapes from special crystals to control how electricity flows. They used a special tool called a focused ion beam to carve tiny twisty shapes, like spirals, from a magnetic crystal made of cobalt, tin, and sulfur. These twisty shapes act like tiny switches for electricity, letting it flow more easily in one direction than the other. This could help make future electronics smaller and more powerful. The scientists showed that the shape of the device can change how electricity moves, which is a new idea for designing electronic parts. They hope this method can lead to better memory, logic, and sensing technologies in the future.",
