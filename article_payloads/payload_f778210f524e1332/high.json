  "title": "Engineering Electrical Nonreciprocity through 3D Nanoscale Geometry in Topological Crystals",
  "summary": "A study by scientists at the RIKEN Center for Emergent Matter Science introduces a novel nanosculpting technique utilizing focused ion beams to fabricate three-dimensional helical devices from single crystal topological magnetic materials, specifically Co3Sn2S2. This approach enables the creation of nanoscale structures that exhibit nonreciprocal electrical transport, functioning as switchable diodes where current flows preferentially in one direction, reversible via magnetization changes or helix handedness alterations. The research addresses significant challenges in nanofabrication, such as material restrictions and quality degradation, by offering sub-micron precision that theoretically accommodates diverse crystalline substrates. Through systematic experimentation involving varied helix dimensions and temperature-dependent measurements, the team elucidated that the diode effect arises from asymmetric electron scattering along chiral, curved surfaces, underscoring geometry as a pivotal design parameter for modulating electronic behavior. This convergence of materials physics and advanced fabrication methodologies suggests potential applications in low-power, shape-engineered components for memory, logic, and sensing technologies. Published in Nature Nanotechnology, the work emphasizes treating geometric symmetry breaking equivalently to intrinsic material properties, paving the way for innovative device architectures in ballistic or hydrodynamic transport regimes.",
