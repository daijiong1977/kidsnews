  "title": "Controlling Electricity with 3D Nanoscale Crystal Structures",
  "summary": "Researchers at the RIKEN Center for Emergent Matter Science have developed a new technique for creating three-dimensional nanoscale devices from single crystal materials. They used a focused ion beam instrument to precisely carve tiny helical structures from a topological magnetic crystal composed of cobalt, tin, and sulfur (Co3Sn2S2). These structures function as switchable diodes, allowing electric current to flow more easily in one direction than the other, and the effect can be reversed by changing magnetization or helix handedness. This method addresses limitations in existing fabrication techniques, which often restrict material choices and compromise device quality. By comparing different helix sizes and measuring behavior at various temperatures, the team found that the diode effect results from uneven electron scattering along the curved, chiral walls. This shows that physical shape can directly influence electrical properties, suggesting geometry can be used as a design tool for low-power components in future technologies like memory, logic, and sensing. The study, published in Nature Nanotechnology, highlights the potential of combining materials physics with advanced nanofabrication to engineer new electronic functions.",
