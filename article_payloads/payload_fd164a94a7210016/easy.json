  "title": "A Big Boss Leaves His Job Because of a Bad Friend",
  "summary": "A man named Sultan Ahmed bin Sulayem was the head of a big company called DP World that runs ports all over the world. He recently left his job because people found out he was friends with Jeffrey Epstein, a man who did very bad things and went to jail. The company said he quit right away. Some other companies and groups that work with DP World are now worried and have stopped giving them new money. Emails show that Sulayem and Epstein talked a lot for many years, sharing travel plans and business ideas. Being in the emails does not mean Sulayem did anything wrong, but it made many people upset. DP World has new bosses now, and Sulayem's picture was taken off their website.",
