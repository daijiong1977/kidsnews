  "title": "DP World Chairman Resigns Amid Epstein Email Scandal",
  "summary": "Sultan Ahmed bin Sulayem, the chairman and CEO of DP World, a major global ports operator based in Dubai, resigned abruptly after facing mounting pressure due to his connections with Jeffrey Epstein, a convicted sex offender. The resignation followed the release of court documents revealing hundreds of emails exchanged between Sulayem and Epstein over more than a decade, indicating a close relationship. While being mentioned in the files does not imply wrongdoing, the association led to significant backlash: the UK development finance agency and Canada's La Caisse pension fund suspended new investments in DP World, and the Prince of Wales' Earthshot project was reported to the UK Charity Commission. The emails show Epstein introduced Sulayem to international figures and included discussions on travel and business. US lawmakers accused Sulayem of being among 'six powerful men' linked to Epstein, and a redacted email referenced a 'torture video,' though context is unclear. DP World appointed new leadership and removed Sulayem's photo from its website, highlighting the impact of corporate reputation in global trade.",
