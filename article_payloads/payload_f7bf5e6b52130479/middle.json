  "title": "Honoring a Literary Icon: Memorial for Jilly Cooper",
  "summary": "A memorial service was held at Southwark Cathedral in London for Dame Jilly Cooper, the renowned British novelist who died in October 2025 at age 88 due to injuries from a fall. The event attracted notable figures including Queen Camilla, Dame Joanna Lumley, David Tennant, and others from the entertainment and literary worlds, such as actor Stanley Tucci and broadcaster Clare Balding. Attendees paid tribute to Cooper's legacy, describing her as an extraordinary woman with a 'champagne soul'—full of light, humor, and compassion. Her bestselling works, particularly The Rutshire Chronicles starting with Riders in 1985, explored the scandals and social dynamics of the wealthy horse-riding community, selling over 11 million copies in the UK. The recent Disney+ adaptation of Rivals in 2024 revived her popularity, with Queen Camilla even visiting the set. During the service, extracts from her novels and diaries were read, highlighting her emotional intelligence and generosity, as remembered by her agent Felicity Blunt and others. The gathering served as a heartfelt celebration of her life and contributions to literature.",
