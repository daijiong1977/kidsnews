  "title": "Elephant Whiskers: Nature's Smart Sensors",
  "summary": "Elephants have amazing trunks that can pick up tiny things like peanuts. Scientists found that whiskers on the trunk help elephants feel things better. These whiskers are special because they are thick and have holes inside, making them strong and hard to break. Unlike cat whiskers, elephant whiskers do not move. The base of the whisker is stiff like plastic, and the tip is soft like rubber. This helps elephants know exactly what they are touching without looking. Researchers used tools like microscopes and 3D printing to study the whiskers. They made a big wand to test how it feels, and it worked like a sensitive tool. This discovery could help make robots that can feel things better, just like elephants do.",
