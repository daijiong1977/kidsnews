  "title": "Scientists Make a Super Material to Clean Up Forever Chemicals",
  "summary": "Scientists at Rice University have made a new material that can quickly clean up forever chemicals from water. Forever chemicals, called PFAS, are man-made substances that don't break down easily and can make people sick. They are found in things like Teflon pans and waterproof clothes. The new material is made from copper and aluminum and works much faster and better than old methods. It can remove PFAS in minutes, which is 100 times faster than carbon filters. The scientists tested it in river water, tap water, and wastewater, and it worked well everywhere. This could help make water safer for everyone.",

    "Forever chemicals, or PFAS, are man-made substances used in products like Teflon pans and waterproof clothes because they resist heat and water. However, they don't break down easily in the environment, which is why they're called 'forever.' They can get into water and soil, and exposure has been linked to health problems like liver damage and cancer. Cleaning them up has been hard because old methods are slow and inefficient. Scientists have been looking for better ways to remove these chemicals to protect people and the environment."
