  "title": "A Colorful Radio Picture of Our Milky Way Galaxy",
  "summary": "Astronomers have made a big, colorful radio image of the Milky Way galaxy. This picture shows our galaxy from the Southern Hemisphere using radio waves, which are like invisible colors of light. It helps scientists learn how stars are born, grow, and die. A student named Silvia worked on this for 18 months using supercomputers to put the image together. The data came from telescopes in Australia that looked at the sky over many nights. The new image is better than an old one because it is sharper, more sensitive, and covers more of the sky. It lets astronomers see things like exploded stars and places where new stars form more clearly. This helps us understand our galaxy better.",

    "The Milky Way is our galaxy, home to billions of stars. Astronomers use tools like telescopes to study it. Radio waves are a type of energy that can pass through space and help create images of objects we cannot see with our eyes. Supercomputers are powerful machines that can handle lots of data quickly. This article talks about a new image that shows the Milky Way in radio colors, helping scientists learn more about stars."
