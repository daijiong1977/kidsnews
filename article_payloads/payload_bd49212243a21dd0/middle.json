  "title": "Unveiling the Milky Way: A New Radio Image Revolutionizes Astronomy",
  "summary": "Astronomers from the International Centre of Radio Astronomy Research have created the largest low-frequency radio color image of the Milky Way, offering an unprecedented view from the Southern Hemisphere. This image, produced by PhD student Silvia Mantovanini over 18 months using about 1 million CPU hours on supercomputers, combines data from the Murchison Widefield Array telescope in Western Australia. It draws from the GLEAM and GLEAM-X surveys, which collected observations over 141 nights between 2013 and 2020. Compared to a previous 2019 image, this new version has twice the resolution, ten times the sensitivity, and covers double the sky area, enabling detailed study of stellar phenomena. It helps astronomers trace supernova remnants and stellar nurseries, providing insights into star formation, evolution, and death. This advancement supports research on how stars interact within the galaxy, revealing clearer structures and enhancing our understanding of cosmic processes.",
