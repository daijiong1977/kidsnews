  "title": "BBC Leader Should Stay for Now",
  "summary": "A leader in the UK government, Dame Caroline Dinenage, says it is not a good time to change the BBC's chairman, Samir Shah. She thinks the BBC needs stability because it has had some problems recently. For example, two top bosses left after a TV show edited a speech by Donald Trump, who is now threatening to sue the BBC. Dame Caroline believes the BBC should focus on finding new leaders and improving itself instead of making more changes at the top. She also mentioned that there is some chaos in the BBC and the board needs to work better. Shah says he wants to fix the issues and won't leave his job. This story shows how important it is for big organizations to have strong leadership during tough times.",
