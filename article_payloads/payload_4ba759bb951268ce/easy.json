  "title": "A Letter About Names in a Bad Man's Files",
  "summary": "The Justice Department sent a letter to Congress with a list of names from the files of Jeffrey Epstein, a man who did bad things. The letter has about 280 names of people called 'politically exposed persons,' but it doesn't explain what that means. Some names, like Princess Diana and Elvis Presley, are famous people Epstein might not have even met. The letter was sent because of a law that says the government must share these documents. But there are still many more secret files. The news report talks about why this list is confusing and why people are upset about it.",

    "Jeffrey Epstein was a wealthy man who was convicted of crimes involving young people. After he died, his files became important because they might show who else was involved. The government made a law called the Epstein Files Transparency Act to release some of these files to the public. This article talks about a letter from the Justice Department that lists names from those files, but it doesn't give much detail, which makes people curious and concerned."
