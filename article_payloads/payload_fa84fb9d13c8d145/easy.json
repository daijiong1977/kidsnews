  "title": "Mystery of a Teen Found in a Singer's Car",
  "summary": "A 15-year-old girl named Celeste Rivas Hernandez was found dead in singer D4vd's car in Hollywood. Her body was discovered in the trunk after police smelled something bad at a tow yard. The court has sealed the records, meaning no one can see the details about her death. The police asked for this to get information first. The medical examiner says this is very unusual and not helpful. Celeste had been missing since April, and her body was badly decomposed. She had a tattoo similar to the singer's. No one has been arrested, and the investigation is ongoing.",
