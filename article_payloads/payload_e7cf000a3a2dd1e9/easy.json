  "title": "Scientists Find Tiny RNA Clues in Cancer",
  "summary": "Scientists discovered tiny RNA molecules called oncRNAs that are found in cancer but not in normal cells. They studied many types of cancer like breast, lung, and colon, and found that each cancer has its own unique set of oncRNAs, like a special barcode. These oncRNAs help identify the cancer type and can even make tumors grow faster. In experiments with mice, some oncRNAs caused cancer cells to spread or multiply more quickly. The scientists also found that cancer cells release oncRNAs into the blood, which can be measured with a simple blood test. In breast cancer patients, high levels of oncRNAs after treatment meant worse survival, showing these molecules could help doctors monitor cancer. This research helps us understand cancer better and may lead to new ways to detect and treat it.",

    "Cancer is a disease where cells in the body grow too much and can spread. Scientists study it to find ways to help people get better. RNA is a tiny molecule in cells that helps control how they work. In this article, scientists found special RNAs called oncRNAs that are only in cancer cells. They used experiments with mice and blood tests from patients to learn how oncRNAs affect cancer and might help doctors in the future."
