  "title": "Iran's Internet Shut Down During Protests",
  "summary": "In Iran, the internet and phone services were almost completely shut off because of big protests about the country's economy. People are unhappy with how things are going. At the same time, in Ukraine, emergency crews are working hard to bring back power after Russia attacked energy targets, causing a big blackout. Also, United Nations officials are criticizing the Trump Administration for leaving many international groups, including one that helps with climate change. These are three important news stories happening around the world.",

    "This article talks about news from different countries. In Iran, people are protesting because they are not happy with how the economy is doing, and the government shut off internet and phone services. In Ukraine, Russia attacked places that make electricity, so many people lost power, and workers are trying to fix it. Also, the United States under President Trump decided to leave some international groups, and United Nations officials think this is a bad idea, especially for dealing with climate change. These events show how countries are connected and face big challenges."
