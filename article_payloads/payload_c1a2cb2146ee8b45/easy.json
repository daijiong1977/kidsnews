  "title": "A Big Fire at a Party in Switzerland",
  "summary": "A terrible fire happened at a New Year's Eve party in a place called Crans-Montana in Switzerland. It was in a bar named Le Constellation. About 40 people died, and 115 more got hurt, mostly with bad burns. An 18-year-old man saw the fire and tried to help. He heard a loud explosion and saw a lot of smoke. He went inside to look for his brother because he thought his brother was there. Inside, he saw people burning and no clothes on them. It was very scary. His brother was okay and not hurt. Firefighters and medics came quickly to help. Two women named Emma and Albane were also at the party. They said the fire started when a waitress put birthday candles on champagne bottles. The ceiling caught fire fast because it was made of wood. It was hard to escape because the stairs were narrow. This turned a happy celebration into a sad night.",
