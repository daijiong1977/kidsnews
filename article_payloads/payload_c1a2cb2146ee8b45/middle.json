  "title": "Eyewitness Accounts of a Devastating Fire at a Swiss Ski Resort Bar",
  "summary": "A catastrophic fire erupted at Le Constellation bar in Crans-Montana, Switzerland, during a New Year's Eve celebration, resulting in approximately 40 fatalities and 115 injuries, primarily from severe burns. The incident occurred around 01:30 local time, transforming a festive evening into a tragedy. An anonymous 18-year-old eyewitness recounted hearing a loud explosion and seeing dense smoke before entering the bar to search for his brother, whom he feared was inside. He described a horrifying scene with people burning and devoid of clothing, though his brother was ultimately unharmed. Firefighters and medical personnel responded swiftly, but the witness assisted by providing water and clothes to victims. Two French women, Emma and Albane, reported that the fire likely originated when a waitress placed birthday candles on champagne bottles, igniting the wooden ceiling rapidly. They highlighted evacuation challenges due to narrow escape routes and stairs. The bar, capable of holding up to 300 people across two floors and a terrace, was crowded during one of the busiest holiday periods for Alpine ski resorts. This event underscores the dangers of fire in crowded venues and the importance of safety measures.",
