  "title": "Weight Loss Drugs: What Happens When People Stop Taking Them?",
  "summary": "A new study looks at what happens when people stop taking weight loss drugs like Ozempic. These drugs help people lose weight and improve their health, such as lowering cholesterol and blood pressure. But when people stop the medicine, they often start gaining weight back quickly—about 0.4 kilograms per month. This means they could return to their original weight in less than two years. The health benefits, like better heart health, also fade away. The study found that weight comes back faster after stopping drugs compared to losing weight through diet and exercise. Researchers say these drugs might not be enough for long-term weight control on their own. Many people stop taking the drugs within a year, so it's important to know what happens afterward. The study reviewed data from over 9,000 people to understand these effects.",

    "Weight loss drugs are medicines that doctors prescribe to help people with obesity lose weight. They work by affecting how the body feels hungry or uses energy. Popular drugs include Ozempic and Wegovy. Losing weight can make people healthier by reducing risks for diseases like diabetes and heart problems. However, keeping weight off can be hard, and this study shows that stopping the drugs might lead to gaining weight back quickly. It's important to combine drugs with healthy habits like eating well and exercising for long-term success."
