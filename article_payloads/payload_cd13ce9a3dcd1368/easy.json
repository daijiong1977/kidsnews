  "title": "Mysterious Red Dots in Space",
  "summary": "The James Webb Space Telescope found strange red dots in space that scientists can't explain. These dots are very small and red, and there are many more than expected. They are so far away that their light took 12 billion years to reach us, meaning we see them as they were long ago. Scientists think they might be galaxies full of stars or something else, but they don't match anything known. To learn more, they used a special program called RUBIES to study them. This discovery could change how we understand the universe.",

    "The James Webb Space Telescope is a powerful tool launched to explore space. It can see things that are very far and red, which older telescopes like Hubble couldn't. Scientists use it to learn about stars, galaxies, and how the universe began. When they find something new, like red dots, they study it to understand if it's a galaxy, a black hole, or something else. This helps us know more about space and how it changes over time."
