  "title": "Raducanu's Early Exit in Dubai Highlights Tennis Challenges",
  "summary": "Emma Raducanu, the British tennis star and former US Open champion, faced an unexpected defeat in the first round of the Dubai Tennis Championships. Her opponent, Antonia Ruzic from Croatia, ranked 67th globally, entered the main draw as a lucky loser after several withdrawals due to injuries, illness, or scheduling conflicts. The match unfolded dramatically: Ruzic dominated the first set 6-1, but Raducanu mounted a comeback in the second set, winning 7-5 after being down 5-3. However, in the decisive third set, Raducanu initially led 2-0 before Ruzic rallied to win six consecutive games, securing a 6-2 victory. This marked Ruzic's first career win over a top-30 player, a significant milestone she attributed to quick adaptation despite minimal preparation. Raducanu's performance was hampered by medical issues, as she required attention during the match, similar to her recent retirement in Qatar. The article underscores the unpredictable nature of tennis, where lower-ranked players like Ruzic can capitalize on opportunities, and highlights Raducanu's ongoing struggles with consistency and health since her 2021 US Open triumph.",
