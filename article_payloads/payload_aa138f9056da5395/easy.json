  "title": "A Big Meeting About a Bad Man's Papers",
  "summary": "Pam Bondi, a lawyer for the government, had a meeting with lawmakers in Congress. They asked her many questions about files related to Jeffrey Epstein, a man who did bad things to people. Bondi did not want to talk much about these files. She got angry and said mean things to the Democrats who were asking questions. She said they were just putting on a show. Instead, she talked about how past governments did not do enough about Epstein. Republicans in the meeting supported Bondi and blamed others. Some people who were hurt by Epstein watched the meeting and were upset because they felt the files were not handled safely. The meeting showed that people are fighting over how to deal with Epstein's case.",

    "Jeffrey Epstein was a rich man who hurt many people, especially young women and girls. He was arrested and put in jail, but he died before his trial. The government has papers called files about his crimes. Pam Bondi is a lawyer who helps the government with legal matters. Congress is a group of people in Washington D.C. who make laws and check on the government. Democrats and Republicans are two big groups in Congress who often disagree. Survivors are people who were hurt by Epstein and want justice."
