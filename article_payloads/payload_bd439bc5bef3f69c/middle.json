  "title": "Wunmi Mosaku's Bafta Win: Embracing Heritage and Representation",
  "summary": "Wunmi Mosaku, a 39-year-old actress born in Nigeria and raised in Manchester, won the Bafta award for Best Supporting Actress for her role as Annie, a Hoodoo priestess in the musical horror film Sinners. This makes her the first black British winner in this category. Mosaku expressed that playing Annie allowed her to reconnect with her ancestral power and cultural identity, which she had suppressed as an immigrant trying to assimilate. She highlighted the importance of representation, noting that her performance resonated with black women who felt seen and valued. Mosaku's journey into acting began after watching the film Annie as a child, which inspired her to research drama schools, leading her to train at prestigious institutions. She has previously won a TV Bafta for her role in Damilola, Our Loved Boy, and has appeared in shows like Luther and Black Mirror. In her acceptance speech, she thanked her daughter and shared her shock at the win. This article explores themes of immigration, cultural heritage, and the impact of media representation on marginalized communities.",
