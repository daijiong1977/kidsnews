  "title": "Health Risks from Crops in Mining-Affected Soil",
  "summary": "Researchers from the University of São Paulo, Federal University of Espírito Santo, and University of Santiago de Compostela investigated crops near the Doce River estuary in Brazil, an area contaminated by the 2015 Fundão tailings dam collapse. They analyzed bananas, cassava, and cocoa pulp for toxic metals like cadmium, chromium, copper, nickel, and lead, which are linked to iron oxides in mining waste. The study, published in Environmental Geochemistry and Health, found that bananas grown in this soil may pose health risks, particularly for children under six, due to the absorption of potentially toxic elements (PTEs) into edible parts. Lead author Amanda Duim's doctoral research highlighted how PTEs move from soil to plants and into the human food chain. The team collected and analyzed soil and plant samples, discovering that cocoa pulp exceeded FAO safety limits for copper and lead. This work aims to assess human health risks and identify native species for environmental cleanup.",

    "The Fundão tailings dam collapse in 2015 released iron mining waste into the Doce River in Brazil, contaminating soil and water. This disaster has long-term environmental and health impacts, as toxic metals can persist in ecosystems. Researchers study how plants absorb these metals to understand risks to human food supplies. The study is part of ongoing efforts to monitor pollution and develop cleanup strategies, involving international collaboration and doctoral research that has received awards for sustainability."

    "Main Points: The study found that bananas, cassava, and cocoa grown in soil contaminated by the 2015 mining disaster absorb toxic metals like cadmium and lead, posing health risks, especially for young children. Purpose: To assess human health risks by linking soil contamination to crop uptake and to explore environmental cleanup using native species. Evidence Evaluation: Based on systematic sampling and laboratory analysis of soil and plant tissues, with results published in a peer-reviewed journal. Author Credibility: Conducted by researchers from reputable universities in Brazil and Spain, led by Amanda Duim as part of award-winning doctoral work. Methodology: Involved collecting, washing, drying, and grinding plant samples, then dissolving them for chemical analysis to measure metal concentrations."
