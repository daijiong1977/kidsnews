  "title": "Assessing Human Health Risks from Phytotoxic Metal Uptake in Post-Mining Disaster Agriculture",
  "summary": "A multidisciplinary research team from the University of São Paulo, Federal University of Espírito Santo, and University of Santiago de Compostela conducted a comprehensive study on crops cultivated near the Doce River estuary in Linhares, Espírito Santo, Brazil, following the 2015 Fundão tailings dam collapse. The investigation focused on bananas, cassava, and cocoa pulp, analyzing concentrations of cadmium, chromium, copper, nickel, and lead—potentially toxic elements (PTEs) associated with iron oxides from mining waste. Published in Environmental Geochemistry and Health, the findings indicate that banana consumption may present significant health risks for children aged six and under, due to PTE absorption into edible tissues. Lead author Amanda Duim's doctoral research, supported by FAPESP and recognized with awards such as the USP Thesis Award in Sustainability, elucidates the biochemical dynamics of PTE transfer from contaminated soil through water into plants. The methodology involved meticulous sample collection, processing, and acid dissolution to quantify PTE levels, revealing that cocoa pulp exceeded FAO safety limits for copper and lead. This study contributes to understanding environmental contamination pathways and identifies native species for phytoremediation, emphasizing the intersection of agricultural science, public health, and environmental engineering.",

    "The 2015 Fundão tailings dam collapse in Minas Gerais, Brazil, released approximately 43 million cubic meters of iron ore waste into the Doce River, causing one of the worst environmental disasters in the country's history. This event has led to persistent contamination of soil and water with potentially toxic elements (PTEs), raising concerns about long-term ecological and public health impacts. Research in this area integrates soil science, environmental engineering, and public health to assess how PTEs move through ecosystems and into food chains. The study discussed is part of a growing body of work on phytoremediation and risk assessment, highlighting the importance of interdisciplinary approaches and international collaboration in addressing post-disaster recovery and sustainable agriculture."
