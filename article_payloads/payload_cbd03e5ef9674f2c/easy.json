  "title": "Bananas with Bad Stuff After Mining Accident",
  "summary": "Scientists studied bananas, cassava, and cocoa grown near a river in Brazil after a big mining accident in 2015. The accident spilled waste from an iron mine into the soil. The researchers found that bananas and other crops absorbed toxic metals like cadmium and lead from the contaminated soil. Eating these bananas could be risky for young children under six years old. The study helps us understand how mining waste can get into our food. It was done by a team from universities in Brazil and Spain. They want to keep people safe by checking if food from polluted areas is okay to eat.",
