  "title": "A Little Boy and His Dad Get to Leave a Detention Center",
  "summary": "A judge said a 5-year-old boy named Liam and his dad must be let go from a detention center in Texas. They were held by immigration officers in Minnesota. The judge was upset because he thinks the government is trying to deport too many people and hurting children. Liam and his dad were taken to Texas after being detained. Some people say the officers used Liam to trick his mom, but the government says that is not true. The dad is from Ecuador and wants to stay in the U.S. for safety. Many people protested to help them, and the judge compared the government's actions to old problems in history.",

    "This article is about a family caught up in immigration rules in the U.S. Immigration is when people move to a new country. Sometimes, the government detains or holds people if they think they broke the rules. Judges can decide if this is fair. In this case, a little boy and his dad were held, and a judge said they should be let go because it might hurt the child. People often protest to support families in these situations."
