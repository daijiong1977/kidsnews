  "title": "Challenging the Dominance of Sinner and Alcaraz in Men's Tennis",
  "summary": "The article examines the current dominance of Jannik Sinner and Carlos Alcaraz in men's tennis, who have collectively won the past eight Grand Slam titles, raising questions about potential challengers for 2026. It highlights their success in major tournaments like the Australian Open and Wimbledon for Sinner, and the French Open and US Open for Alcaraz, contrasting this with the previous era of the 'Big Three'—Federer, Nadal, and Djokovic. Expert analysis from Patrick Mouratoglou, a renowned coach, suggests that the margin Sinner and Alcaraz hold over other players makes it challenging to identify immediate threats. The piece profiles Ben Shelton as a promising contender, noting his powerful serve and semi-final appearances in Grand Slams, though he has faced defeats against Sinner and Alcaraz. Overall, the article explores the dynamics of tennis competition and invites readers to consider who might break this duopoly in the near future.",
