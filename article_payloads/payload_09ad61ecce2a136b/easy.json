  "summary": "The FTSE 100 is a list of the 100 biggest companies in the UK, and it recently reached a very high number, which made investors happy. This article talks about whether this is a good time for people to start investing their money. Investing means putting money into things like stocks to try to make more money over time, but it can be risky because the value can go up and down. The article says that investing is usually best for the long term, like many years, so your money can grow bigger than if you just save it in a bank. However, it also explains that saving money in a bank is safer and good for emergencies because you can get your money quickly. Experts in the article say everyone should have some savings before they start investing to be safe. So, the article helps us understand that both saving and investing are important, but you need to think carefully about your own money.",
