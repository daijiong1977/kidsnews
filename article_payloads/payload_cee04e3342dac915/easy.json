  "title": "Boiling Oceans on Icy Moons",
  "summary": "Scientists have found that some icy moons in our solar system might have oceans that can boil. These moons, like Enceladus, have icy shells covering their insides. When the ice melts into water, the moon shrinks a little because water is denser than ice. This shrinking creates low pressure under the ice shell. On small moons, this low pressure can make the ocean water boil, even if it's cold. Boiling releases bubbles of gas from the water. This happens because small moons have weak gravity. The study helps us understand how moons change over time and could affect if they can support life. It's exciting to learn about these distant worlds and their hidden oceans.",

    "Icy moons are found around planets like Jupiter and Saturn. They have frozen surfaces, but scientists think there might be liquid water oceans underneath. Water can exist as liquid even in cold places if there's enough pressure or heat. Gravity is the force that holds moons together and affects pressure. When ice melts into water, it takes up less space, which can change the pressure inside the moon. This article talks about how these changes might make water boil on small moons, which is important for understanding if life could exist there."
