  "title": "College Sports Changes: Players Can Move and Get Paid",
  "summary": "College sports are changing in big ways. Players can now move to different schools through a system called the transfer portal. This happens around New Year's Day, which is also when big football games are played. Also, players can get paid money for using their name, image, and likeness, which is called NIL. This means colleges can pay athletes, sometimes millions of dollars. Experts like Stewart Mandel talk about how this is like a Wild West because the rules are new and confusing. Coaches are frustrated because players might keep moving schools. The article helps us understand what this means for college sports and athletes.",
