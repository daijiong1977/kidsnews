  "title": "Using AI to Improve Your Diet and Meal Planning",
  "summary": "This article explores how artificial intelligence, specifically ChatGPT, can assist in maintaining a healthy diet through effective meal planning. It explains that meal planning is often challenging due to lack of time or ideas, but AI can generate customized meal plans based on user inputs like budget, dietary preferences, and available ingredients. For instance, users can request high-fiber dinners or high-protein vegetarian meals, and ChatGPT provides recipes with nutritional details. The author tested this by asking for specific meal criteria and found the suggestions practical, such as lentil curry and stir-fried vegetables. Additionally, AI helps reduce food waste by suggesting recipes for leftover ingredients, like using ricotta in pasta dishes. It also supports batch cooking by outlining schedules and storage tips for meals that last the week. Overall, the article highlights how ChatGPT acts as an accessible tool to simplify nutrition tracking and meal preparation, making healthy eating more achievable without professional help.",
