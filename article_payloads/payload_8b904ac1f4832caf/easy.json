  "title": "How AI Helps You Eat Healthy Foods",
  "summary": "This article talks about how a smart computer program called ChatGPT can help you eat healthier. It can plan your meals so you don't get stuck eating cereal for dinner. For example, you can ask it for quick dinner ideas that are cheap and healthy, like lentil curry or stir-fried vegetables. It can also use the food you already have in your fridge to suggest recipes, which helps reduce waste. If you're tired, it can make a meal plan based on what's in your cupboard. Plus, it can help with nutrition by creating balanced meal plans that fit your calorie goals, such as high-protein vegetarian meals. This makes eating healthy easier and more fun, just like having a helper in the kitchen.",
