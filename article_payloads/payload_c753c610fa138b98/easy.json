    "The Pogues are a music band from London that started in 1982. They play a mix of punk rock and Irish folk music, which means fast, energetic songs with traditional sounds. Andrew Ranken was one of the first members and helped create their unique style. Bands often have drummers to keep the beat, and Ranken was important for making their music fun and lively. When someone in a band dies, it can be sad for fans and the other members, who might share memories to honor them."
