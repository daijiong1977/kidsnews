  "summary": "The Reading and Leeds Festival 2026 will be headlined by British stars Charli XCX, Dave, and Raye, along with Irish rockers Fontaines DC, electronic duo Chase & Status, and singer Florence + The Machine. Organizers highlight that this marks the first time in 25 years that all headliners are exclusively from Britain and Ireland, emphasizing a focus on local talent. The festival, scheduled for August 27-30, will feature additional performances by artists like Kasabian, Kneecap, Skepta, and international acts such as Sombr and Role Model. A notable change includes a Thursday headline slot at Leeds with Kasabian. Tickets go on general sale on Thursday, with presales already available.
