  "title": "Scientists Find New Rule for Tiny Engines",
  "summary": "Scientists at the University of Stuttgart discovered that an old rule about how engines work does not apply to very tiny engines at the atomic scale. This rule, called the Carnot principle, was made 200 years ago for big engines like steam turbines. The scientists found that when particles are linked together in tiny systems, quantum effects allow these small engines to be more efficient than larger ones. This means they can convert heat into movement better than expected. Their work, published in Science Advances, could help create super-small and energy-efficient quantum motors in the future, which might be used in medical nanobots or other tiny machines.",

    "Thermodynamics is the study of heat and energy. Engines, like those in cars, use heat to create movement. The Carnot principle is an old rule from 200 years ago that says how efficient these engines can be, but it was made for big engines. Scientists are now studying tiny systems at the atomic scale, where quantum effects—special behaviors in very small things—can change how engines work. This discovery might lead to new, super-small engines for future technology."
