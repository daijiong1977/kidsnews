  "title": "Challenging Thermodynamics: Quantum Effects Boost Efficiency in Atomic-Scale Engines",
  "summary": "Physicists at the University of Stuttgart have challenged the 200-year-old Carnot principle, a foundational law of thermodynamics, by demonstrating it does not fully apply at the atomic scale for correlated systems. Their research, published in Science Advances, shows that when particles are strongly linked through quantum correlations, tiny heat engines can exceed the traditional efficiency limit. The Carnot principle, established by Sadi Carnot for large-scale systems like steam turbines, sets a maximum efficiency based on temperature differences. However, the Stuttgart team derived generalized thermodynamic laws incorporating quantum correlations, revealing that atomic-scale thermal machines can convert not only heat but also these correlations into work, leading to higher efficiency. This breakthrough could accelerate the development of quantum motors—extremely small and energy-efficient engines—with potential applications in medical nanobots and nanoscale manipulation. The work highlights how reexamining basic physics can open new technological horizons, emphasizing the role of quantum effects in enhancing performance at microscopic dimensions.",

    "Thermodynamics is a branch of physics dealing with heat, energy, and work. The Carnot principle, part of the second law of thermodynamics, was formulated in the 19th century by Sadi Carnot to define the maximum efficiency of heat engines like steam turbines, based on temperature differences. In recent years, advances in quantum mechanics have enabled the study of microscopic systems, where quantum effects—such as correlations between particles—alter traditional physical laws. This research builds on that, exploring how these effects can enhance efficiency in atomic-scale engines, potentially leading to innovations in nanotechnology and energy conversion."
