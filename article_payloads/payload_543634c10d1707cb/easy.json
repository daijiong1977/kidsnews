  "title": "A Baby Born from a Donated Womb",
  "summary": "A baby boy named Hugo was born in the UK using a womb from a donor who had passed away. His mom, Grace Bell, was born without a womb due to a condition called MRKH syndrome, which affects some women. She couldn't have a baby on her own, so doctors transplanted a womb from a kind donor. After surgery and IVF treatment, Hugo was born healthy. Grace is very thankful to the donor's family for their gift. This is the first time this has happened in the UK, and it gives hope to other women who can't carry a baby.",
