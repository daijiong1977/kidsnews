  "title": "UK's First Baby Born via Deceased Donor Womb Transplant",
  "summary": "In a groundbreaking medical achievement, a baby boy named Hugo has become the first child in the UK to be born using a womb transplanted from a deceased donor. His mother, Grace Bell, who is in her 30s and was born without a viable womb due to MRKH syndrome—a condition affecting about 1 in 5,000 women in the UK—underwent a 10-hour transplant surgery at The Churchill Hospital in Oxford in June 2024. After receiving IVF treatment and embryo transfer at The Lister Fertility Clinic in London, Hugo was born healthy at Queen Charlotte's and Chelsea Hospital in December 2025. Grace and her partner Steve Powell expressed deep gratitude to the donor's family for their selfless gift, which enabled her to carry and give birth to her own child. This milestone offers hope to many women with similar reproductive challenges, highlighting advances in transplant medicine and fertility treatments.",
