  "title": "A Statue Gets Sprayed with Paint in London",
  "summary": "In London, a statue of Winston Churchill, a famous leader from long ago, was sprayed with red paint and words. The police arrested a 38-year-old man because they think he did it. The words on the statue said things like 'Stop the Genocide' and 'Free Palestine.' This happened in Parliament Square, a place with many statues. The statue has been cleaned up and blocked off so people can't touch it. This is not the first time this statue has been painted on; it happened before during protests. The police and city leaders are upset about the damage. The statue was made in 1973 and is very tall.",
