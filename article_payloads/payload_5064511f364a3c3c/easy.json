  "title": "Did Thomas Edison Make a Super-Thin Material by Accident?",
  "summary": "Scientists at Rice University tried an old experiment by Thomas Edison, who invented the light bulb long ago. They wanted to see if he accidentally made a special material called graphene while working on his bulbs. Graphene is very thin and strong, made of carbon atoms, and is used in things like batteries and touchscreens. Edison used bamboo to make the filament, the part that glows in a light bulb, and heated it very hot. The scientists copied his experiment with similar bulbs and found that the filament turned shiny and silver. Using modern tools, they saw it had become graphene in some parts. This doesn't prove Edison made it, but it shows that old experiments can hide surprises. The scientists think other old inventions might have made cool materials too, and we can learn by looking back with new tools.",

    "Thomas Edison was an inventor who lived long ago and made the first practical light bulb. He tried different materials to make the filament, the part that lights up, and found bamboo worked best. Graphene is a modern material discovered in 2004 that is very thin and strong, used in electronics. Scientists today use tools like microscopes to see tiny things that people in Edison's time couldn't see. This article shows how looking back at old inventions with new tools can help us discover cool things."
