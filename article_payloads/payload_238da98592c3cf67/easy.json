  "title": "Pope Visits a Beautiful Mosque",
  "summary": "Pope Leo XIV visited the Blue Mosque in Istanbul, Turkey. He took off his shoes and walked around inside, looking at the pretty tiles and writing on the walls. An imam, who is a Muslim leader, showed him around. The pope did not pray there, even though he was invited to. Instead, he stayed quiet and thought deeply to show respect for the Muslim people and their faith. This visit was meant to help Christians from different groups, like the Orthodox Church, become more united. The pope was following what other popes have done before to be friendly with Muslims. It's important because it shows that people from different religions can be kind and respectful to each other.",
