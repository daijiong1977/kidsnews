  "title": "Doctor Strike Hurts Patients",
  "summary": "The health secretary, Wes Streeing, says that a five-day strike by doctors is causing problems for patients. He is worried that people might get hurt because they cannot see a doctor when they need help. This strike means doctors are not working, so hospitals might have fewer staff to care for sick people. It is important for everyone to stay safe and healthy. The government and doctors are talking to try to solve this issue. Patients and families should follow advice from health officials during this time.",

When they go on strike, it can be hard for patients to get the care they need. The health secretary is a leader who makes sure hospitals and health care work well. In this case, he is concerned that the strike could cause harm, so everyone is talking to find a solution."
