Best known for pastel suits in Duran Duran's Rio video, he collaborated with David Bowie, designing the jacket for As The World Falls Down, and worked with Roxy Music and Queen Camilla. Born in Keighley, he studied at the Royal College of Art and began his career designing menswear, including buttoned trousers for Mick Jagger's 1969 tour. In 1979, he founded his label, staging shows with models like Jerry Hall. His ability to blend menswear and womenswear with technical proficiency earned him recognition as a 'true original' from the British Fashion Council.
