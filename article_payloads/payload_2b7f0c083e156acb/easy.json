  "title": "Police Decide No Charges for Band's Chants at Music Festival",
  "summary": "Police in Avon and Somerset looked into chants made by the band Bob Vylan at the Glastonbury music festival. The chants included words like 'death to the IDF,' which is the Israel Defense Forces. After checking all the evidence, the police said no one will be charged because it does not meet the rules for a crime. Some people, like the Israeli embassy and Jewish charities, are unhappy with this decision. They think it sends a bad message. Bob Vylan is a punk-rap duo from London, and after the festival, they were dropped from other events and had visa problems. The police talked to a man and about 200 people as part of their investigation to see if anyone was hurt by the chants.",
