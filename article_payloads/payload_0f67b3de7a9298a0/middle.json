  "title": "Radiohead's Return: A Hit-Packed London Concert",
  "summary": "Radiohead delivered a captivating performance at London's O2 Arena, marking their first UK gig in 99 months and a decade since their last new music release. The band, led by Thom Yorke, showcased songs spanning their entire career, from early hits like The Bends to recent works such as A Moon Shaped Pool. Despite some minor timing and tuning issues, possibly due to rustiness from the long hiatus, the concert was largely spell-binding. Highlights included energetic tracks like 2+2=5, which resonated with current political themes, and experimental pieces that featured extended musical sections. The rhythm section, enhanced by session musician Chris Vatalaro, stood out with danceable grooves in songs like National Anthem and Idioteque. While the audience struggled to clap along to complex rhythms in 15 Step, they showed unified appreciation through head-bobbing. Crowd-pleasers like Lucky and No Surprises provided emotional depth, making the event a triumphant return for the band and a memorable experience for fans who had eagerly anticipated it.",
