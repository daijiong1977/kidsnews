  "title": "Stan Wawrinka's Resilient Victory at the Australian Open at Age 40",
  "summary": "Stan Wawrinka, a 40-year-old Swiss tennis player, demonstrated resilience by winning his first-round match at the Australian Open against Laslo Djere in four sets, despite losing the first set. This victory marks his first win at a Grand Slam since Wimbledon in 2024 and his first at the Australian Open in five years, highlighting a comeback in his career. Wawrinka, who debuted at the Australian Open 20 years ago and won the title in 2014 by defeating Rafael Nadal, is now on a farewell tour as he plans to retire at the end of the 2026 season. In the match, which lasted three hours and 20 minutes, he fought back from a break down in the fourth set to secure the win. The article also notes that other veterans, like 37-year-old Marin Cilic, advanced to the second round, emphasizing a trend of older players performing well. Wawrinka admitted he is 'not young any more' but stated that his passion for tennis remains intact, and he is not in Melbourne just to say goodbye but to compete seriously. At 40 years and 296 days, he is the second oldest player to win a men's singles match at Melbourne Park, showcasing his enduring skill and determination in the sport.",
