  "title": "Scientists Find a Hidden Weak Spot in Alzheimer's Disease",
  "summary": "Scientists at Aarhus University have found a hidden weak spot that might cause Alzheimer's disease. They discovered a problem with tiny particles called exosomes in brain cells. Exosomes help cells talk to each other and keep the brain healthy. In some people with a gene mutation, cells make fewer and weaker exosomes. This makes it harder for the brain to stay healthy and can lead to Alzheimer's. The researchers hope this discovery will help create new treatments to fix the exosomes and protect the brain from this disease.",

    "Alzheimer's is a disease that makes it hard for people to remember things and think clearly. It often affects older adults. Scientists study the brain to find out what causes it. Genes are like instructions in our bodies that can change, and sometimes these changes lead to diseases. Exosomes are very small parts of cells that help them send messages to each other. When exosomes don't work right, it can cause problems in the brain. This research helps us understand how to keep brains healthy and might lead to new medicines."
