  "title": "Reevaluating Exercise Therapy in Osteoarthritis Management",
  "summary": "An umbrella systematic review and pooled analysis in RMD Open critically assesses the efficacy of exercise therapy for osteoarthritis, revealing predominantly inconclusive evidence with negligible or short-lived effects on pain and function. This research challenges the entrenched paradigm of exercise as a first-line intervention for this degenerative joint disease, prompting a reconsideration of clinical guidelines and research priorities. The analysis encompassed 5 systematic reviews and 28 randomized clinical trials, totaling data from 12,991 participants with knee, hip, hand, or ankle osteoarthritis. Findings indicated small, transient reductions in knee osteoarthritis pain compared to placebo or no treatment, underpinned by very low certainty of evidence. For hip osteoarthritis, moderate-certainty evidence suggested negligible improvement, while hand osteoarthritis demonstrated minor effects. Exercise exhibited comparable outcomes to alternatives such as patient education, manual therapy, pharmacological interventions, injections, and arthroscopy, albeit with variable evidence certainty. In specific long-term trials, exercise was inferior to surgical interventions like osteotomy or joint replacement. Methodological limitations include selective review inclusion, lack of direct head-to-head comparisons, heterogeneity in participant symptom severity, and concomitant treatments. The authors advocate for a paradigm shift, emphasizing that the marginal benefits of exercise warrant a critical reassessment of its role in osteoarthritis management, potentially redirecting focus toward more effective therapeutic strategies.",

    "Osteoarthritis, a leading cause of disability globally, involves progressive joint degeneration mediated by inflammatory and mechanical factors, with management strategies emphasizing symptom control rather than cure. Exercise therapy has been cornerstone in non-pharmacological management, endorsed by guidelines for its potential to enhance joint function and quality of life. However, emerging critiques highlight inconsistencies in trial outcomes and methodological flaws. This article's rigorous synthesis of high-level evidence provides a nuanced critique, suggesting that exercise's benefits may be overstated. Understanding this analysis requires familiarity with evidence-based medicine principles, including systematic review methodologies, certainty grading (e.g., GRADE framework), and clinical trial design. The findings have significant implications for healthcare policy, patient education, and resource allocation, urging a critical appraisal of conventional wisdom in rheumatology and rehabilitation sciences."

    "Main Points: Exercise therapy yields minimal, short-term relief for osteoarthritis, with evidence largely inconclusive; it challenges exercise as first-line treatment. Purpose: To critically evaluate exercise efficacy and prompt a paradigm shift in clinical guidelines by aggregating high-level evidence. Evidence Evaluation: Based on umbrella systematic review and pooled analysis with low to moderate certainty, limited by heterogeneity and lack of direct comparisons. Author Credibility: Published in a peer-reviewed open-access journal, indicating rigorous academic standards and expertise in musculoskeletal research. Methodology: Comprehensive database search up to November 2025, inclusion of systematic reviews and randomized trials, with statistical pooling to assess effects across joint types and comparators. Critical Assessment: Strengths include large sample size and rigorous synthesis; limitations involve potential selection bias and variability in adjunct treatments, suggesting cautious interpretation and need for further high-quality trials."
