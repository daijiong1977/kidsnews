  "title": "Roman Soldiers and Tiny Germs at Hadrian's Wall",
  "summary": "Long ago, Roman soldiers lived at a place called Hadrian's Wall in Britain. They had to deal with tiny bugs called parasites that made them sick. Scientists found old dirt from drains where the soldiers went to the bathroom. In that dirt, they saw eggs from worms like roundworms and whipworms. They also found a tiny germ called Giardia. These parasites spread because things were not very clean. They could get into food, water, or hands that touched poop. The soldiers probably felt bad with stomach aches and diarrhea often. Even though the Romans had toilets and drains, they still got sick because doctors back then did not know how to cure these bugs. This study helps us learn about life for soldiers long ago.",

    "Long ago, the Roman Empire was a big group of places ruled by Rome. Soldiers were people who protected the empire and lived in forts. Hadrian's Wall was built in Britain to keep out other groups. Life was hard for soldiers because they did not have modern things like clean water or good medicine. Parasites are small creatures that can live inside humans and animals, often making them sick. Scientists study old things like dirt and bones to learn about history and how people lived in the past."
