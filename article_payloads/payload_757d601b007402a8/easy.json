  "title": "Cooling Computers with Noise",
  "summary": "Quantum computers are special machines that need to be very cold to work, but cooling them can create noise that messes up their information. Scientists in Sweden made a new tiny refrigerator that uses this noise to help cool the computers instead of fighting it. This device controls heat and energy flow very precisely, which could help build bigger and better quantum computers in the future. Quantum computers might change many things like medicine and communication, but they are hard to make because they are so sensitive. This new idea turns a problem into a solution by using noise to keep things cold.",

    "Quantum computers are advanced machines that use the rules of quantum physics to solve problems faster than regular computers. They need to be kept extremely cold, close to absolute zero, to work because heat can destroy the delicate information they store. Cooling systems often create noise, which is a challenge. Scientists are finding new ways to manage this, like using noise to help with cooling, which could lead to better technology for things like discovering new medicines or keeping communications secure."
