  "title": "Greenland's Big Worry: A Faraway Leader Wants Their Island",
  "summary": "Greenland is a big, icy island near the Arctic Ocean with only 57,000 people living there. Most are Inuit, who are the original people. They have their own government but are part of Denmark. Now, the U.S. president, Donald Trump, says he wants Greenland for America's safety. This makes Greenlanders scared and upset. They like their quiet life and don't want the U.S. to take over. Many also want to be independent from Denmark someday. People in Greenland, like a pensioner and a pottery-maker, say they are tired of Trump and just want to be left alone. They worry about their future because big countries are arguing over their home.",

    "Greenland is a semi-autonomous territory of Denmark, meaning it has its own government but is still connected to Denmark. It's located in the Arctic region and is known for its ice and snow. The Inuit people have lived there for thousands of years. Recently, geopolitical tensions have arisen because the U.S. president, Donald Trump, has expressed interest in acquiring Greenland for strategic reasons, which worries the local population who value their peace and independence."
