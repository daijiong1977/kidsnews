  "title": "Ancient People in Southern Africa Lived Alone for a Long Time",
  "summary": "Scientists found that a group of people in southern Africa lived by themselves for thousands of years until about 1,000 years ago. Modern humans started in Africa, but it's hard to know what happened inside Africa long ago because old DNA doesn't survive well in hot places. A new study looked at old bones from southern Africa and got DNA from them. The DNA shows these people were very different from other groups in Africa and didn't mix with others until recently. They were not a small group; they had many people. This helps us learn more about human history and how groups moved and changed over time.",
