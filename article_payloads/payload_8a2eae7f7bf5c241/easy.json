  "title": "Who Feels Lonely the Most?",
  "summary": "This article talks about loneliness, which is when people feel sad and alone. It says that many people think older adults are the loneliest, but new studies show that young adults, like those in their 20s, might feel lonely the most. For example, Adam Becket, a 26-year-old man, moved to a new city and found it hard to make friends, feeling left out during Halloween. Research from the Office for National Statistics in Britain found that 33% of young people aged 16 to 29 often feel lonely, which is higher than older groups. The World Health Organization also says young adults and teenagers report high loneliness. Experts think this happens because young adults often move away from home, live with strangers, work from home, and use social media instead of meeting friends in person. They say we need to stop thinking young adulthood is always happy and fun, as it can be a tough time. The article suggests that loneliness is a big problem for young people today.",

    "Loneliness is a feeling that many people experience, especially when they are alone or don't have close friends. It can happen to anyone, but this article focuses on young adults. Young adults are people who are just starting their adult lives, often in their late teens or 20s. They might move to new places for school or work, which can make it hard to meet new people. Sometimes, they use phones and computers to talk to friends instead of seeing them in person, which might not help them feel less lonely. Understanding loneliness is important because it can affect how happy and healthy people are. This article uses stories and numbers to show that loneliness is a big issue for young people today, and experts are trying to find ways to help."
