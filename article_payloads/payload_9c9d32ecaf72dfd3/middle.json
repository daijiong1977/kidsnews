  "title": "Challenging Einstein's Light Speed Rule with Cosmic Observations",
  "summary": "Scientists are investigating whether the speed of light, a constant in Einstein's special relativity, might vary under extreme conditions. The principle of Lorentz invariance, which states that physical laws are identical for all observers, originated from the 1887 Michelson-Morley experiment and underpins modern physics, including quantum theory. However, the incompatibility between quantum theory and general relativity—Einstein's theory of gravity—motivates tests for potential Lorentz invariance violations. A research team led by Mercè Guerrero and Anna Campoy-Ordaz examined very-high-energy gamma rays from astrophysical sources to detect tiny speed differences based on photon energy. By analyzing existing data with a new statistical method, they aimed to find evidence of such violations within the Standard Model Extension framework. The study confirmed no violations, upholding Einstein's predictions, but significantly improved experimental limits by an order of magnitude, refining the search for new physics beyond current theories.",

    "The Michelson-Morley experiment in 1887 demonstrated that the speed of light is constant, leading to Einstein's special relativity and the principle of Lorentz invariance. This principle is fundamental in physics, especially in quantum theory and the Standard Model. However, Einstein's general relativity, which describes gravity, conflicts with quantum theory, prompting scientists to explore potential Lorentz invariance violations as clues to quantum gravity. Researchers test these ideas using high-energy cosmic observations, aiming to unify physics and discover new laws beyond current understanding."
