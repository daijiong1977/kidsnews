  "title": "Testing Light Speed with Space Rays",
  "summary": "Scientists are checking if light always travels at the same speed, as Albert Einstein said. Long ago, an experiment by Michelson and Morley showed light speed is constant, which helped Einstein create his theory of special relativity. This idea is called Lorentz invariance and is important in physics. But some scientists wonder if it might change in extreme situations, like when combining quantum theory and gravity. A team led by Mercè Guerrero and Anna Campoy-Ordaz looked at high-energy gamma rays from space to see if light speed varies with energy. They used data from distant stars to measure tiny delays. Their study found no change, supporting Einstein's rule, but they made the test much better, helping narrow down where new science might be found.",

    "In 1887, Michelson and Morley did an experiment that showed light always travels at the same speed, no matter the direction. This helped Albert Einstein develop his theory of special relativity, which says the laws of physics are the same for everyone. Scientists now use this idea, called Lorentz invariance, in many areas like quantum theory. But they are curious if it might break in extreme cases, so they test it with high-energy light from space to learn more about the universe."
