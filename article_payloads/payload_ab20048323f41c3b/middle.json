  "title": "Harry Styles' Comeback with Aperture and Global Tour Plans",
  "summary": "After nearly four years without new music, Harry Styles has released his single Aperture, marking the start of his fourth album, Kiss All The Time. Disco, Occasionally. During his break, he remained active by running marathons in cities like Berlin and Tokyo and attending live concerts, which he says influenced his creative process. In an interview with the BBC, Styles emphasized his desire to avoid isolation and engage with the human experience, contrasting his early touring days spent in hotel rooms. He announced the Together, Together tour for 2026, featuring 50 shows across seven global cities, including six at London's Wembley Stadium and 30 at New York's Madison Square Garden, with stops in Amsterdam, São Paulo, Mexico City, Melbourne, and Sydney. Special guests will support him, such as Shania Twain in London, whom he admired as a child, and artists like Jamie XX, Jorja Smith, and Robyn in other locations. Styles credits his time as an audience member at events like LCD Soundsystem concerts for inspiring his new music, highlighting how this perspective enriched his artistic development.",
