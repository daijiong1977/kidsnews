  "title": "Tech Companies Working Very Long Hours",
  "summary": "This article talks about some tech companies where people work very long hours, like 70 hours a week. One company called Rilla in New York has a website that shows happy workers but warns about long work times. They call this 996 culture, which means working from 9am to 9pm, six days a week. The boss, Will Gao, says employees are like athletes who love their work and don't mind the hours. This is happening because companies want to use artificial intelligence (AI) fast to make money and beat others. It started in China ten years ago with companies like Alibaba. Working so much can be hard, but some people enjoy it for big goals.",
