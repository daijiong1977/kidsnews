  "title": "Small Music Places Are Having Money Trouble",
  "summary": "Small music venues in the UK are important because they help new singers and bands like Ed Sheeran start their careers. But more than half of these places did not make any money last year. Some famous venues closed, and many people lost their jobs. The good news is that more people went to see shows at these small places, and the number of venues closing slowed down. Owners say it is hard to make money because costs are high, like paying workers more. Even when venues say they made a profit, sometimes the owners did not pay themselves. People have less money to spend on tickets because of high prices for other things. These small venues are trying to stay open to keep music alive.",
