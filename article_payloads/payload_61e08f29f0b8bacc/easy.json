  "title": "Colorectal Cancer in Young People: How to Stay Safe",
  "summary": "Colorectal cancer is a disease that affects the colon or rectum, and it is becoming more common in young people, even those as young as 20. Experts are worried because more young adults are getting sick from this cancer. They think things like eating too much junk food, drinking alcohol, not exercising enough, and having an unhealthy gut might be linked to the increase. The gut has tiny organisms that help digest food, and if they are out of balance, it can cause problems. To lower the risk, young people can eat healthy foods like fruits and vegetables, avoid too much red meat and processed snacks, limit alcohol, exercise regularly, and not smoke. This helps keep the body strong and reduces the chance of getting cancer.",
