  "summary": "Paramount is set to buy Warner Bros, a famous movie studio, for about $111 billion. Netflix was also trying to buy it but decided not to because the price was too high. Warner Bros said Paramount's offer was better. This big sale could change how movies and TV shows are made and watched. Netflix said they were careful with their money and didn't want to pay more. The deal needs approval from government officials to make sure it's fair. If it happens, Paramount will own Warner Bros, including its movies and TV networks like CNN. This is a big story in Hollywood.",
