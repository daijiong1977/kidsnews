  "title": "Scientists See Brain Messages to Learn About Parkinson's",
  "summary": "Scientists at Johns Hopkins Medicine have found a new way to watch how brain cells talk to each other very quickly. They used a method called \"zap-and-freeze\" to look at living brain tissue from mice and humans. This helps them see tiny parts called synapses, where messages pass between cells. Most people with Parkinson's disease have a type that is not inherited, and problems at synapses might cause it. By understanding how healthy synapses work and where they go wrong, the scientists hope to find new treatments for Parkinson's. This research was published in a science journal and supported by the National Institutes of Health.",

    "Parkinson's disease is a condition that affects how people move, often causing shaking or stiffness. It happens when brain cells that control movement get damaged. Scientists study brain cells and their connections to find ways to help people with this disease. This article talks about a new tool to see how brain cells communicate, which could lead to better treatments."
