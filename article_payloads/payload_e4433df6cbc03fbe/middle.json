  "title": "Using Gravitational Waves to Detect Dark Matter Around Black Holes",
  "summary": "Researchers at the University of Amsterdam have developed a new method to detect dark matter by analyzing gravitational waves from black hole systems. Their study focuses on extreme mass-ratio inspirals (EMRIs), where a small black hole orbits a much larger one, emitting gravitational waves over long periods. By creating a fully relativistic model based on Einstein's theory of general relativity, they can more accurately predict how dark matter around black holes affects these waves. This model improves upon previous simplified approximations by including important physical effects. The research aims to identify dark matter 'spikes'—dense regions of dark matter that form near massive black holes—which would leave distinct signatures in gravitational wave signals. Future space missions like the European Space Agency's LISA, launching in 2035, are expected to observe these signals for months or years, providing detailed data. This work is a step toward mapping dark matter distribution and understanding its nature, as dark matter constitutes most of the universe's matter but remains invisible and poorly understood.",

    "Dark matter is a hypothetical form of matter that does not interact with light, making it invisible, but it exerts gravitational effects, accounting for about 85% of the total matter in the universe. Its composition and properties remain unknown, posing a major puzzle in astrophysics. Gravitational waves are disturbances in space-time caused by accelerating massive objects, such as merging black holes; they were first directly detected in 2015 by LIGO. Einstein's theory of general relativity predicts these waves and describes gravity as the curvature of space-time. Black holes are regions where gravity is so strong that nothing can escape, often found at galaxy centers. The LISA mission, set for launch in 2035, will use space-based detectors to observe low-frequency gravitational waves from sources like EMRIs, providing new insights into cosmic phenomena."
