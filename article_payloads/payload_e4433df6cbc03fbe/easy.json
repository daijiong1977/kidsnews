  "title": "Finding Hidden Dark Matter with Black Hole Waves",
  "summary": "Scientists have found a new way to learn about dark matter, which is a mysterious substance in space that we cannot see. They use gravitational waves, which are ripples in space caused by big objects like black holes moving. When a small black hole orbits a big black hole, it sends out these waves. By studying these waves carefully, scientists can detect dark matter around the black holes. This helps us understand more about the universe because dark matter makes up most of the stuff in space. The research was done by a team at the University of Amsterdam and uses ideas from Einstein's theory. Future space missions will help collect more data to test this method.",

    "Dark matter is a mysterious substance that makes up about 85% of all matter in the universe, but we cannot see it directly because it does not emit light. Scientists study it by observing its effects on things we can see, like stars and galaxies. Gravitational waves are ripples in space-time predicted by Albert Einstein and first detected in 2015; they come from massive objects like black holes colliding. Black holes are regions in space with such strong gravity that nothing, not even light, can escape. This research helps us understand the hidden parts of our universe better."
