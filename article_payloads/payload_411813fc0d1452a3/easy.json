  "title": "Big Winter Storm Leaves Many Without Power",
  "summary": "A huge winter storm hit many parts of the United States over the weekend. It brought lots of snow, sleet, and ice. At least 25 people died because of the cold weather and accidents like sledding. Millions of Americans are dealing with very cold temperatures for several days. In some states, many people lost electricity, and it might not come back for a while. More than 800,000 homes and businesses, mostly in the South, have no power. The storm caused problems with the power grid, and fixing it could take days. People from Tennessee to Texas to New Jersey are shoveling snow and trying to stay warm. The National Weather Service said 19 states got over a foot of snow. This storm is making life hard for many families.",

    "Winter storms are big weather events that happen in cold months. They can bring snow, ice, and strong winds. Sometimes, storms cause power outages, which means electricity stops working in homes and businesses. This can be dangerous because people need heat to stay warm. Hypothermia is a health problem when the body gets too cold, and it can be serious. The National Weather Service helps warn people about storms so they can prepare. In the United States, different states experience storms in different ways, and communities work together to clean up and stay safe."
