  "title": "Canada Says No to China Trade Deal as U.S. Warns About Tariffs",
  "summary": "Canada's leader, Mark Carney, said his country will not make a big free trade deal with China. This happened after U.S. President Donald Trump threatened to put high taxes on goods from Canada if they did a deal with China. Carney explained that Canada only made a small agreement with China to lower taxes on some products like electric cars, canola oil, and pork. This helps fix problems from past years. Trump posted on social media that China is taking over Canada and the deal is bad, but Carney said Canada follows rules with the U.S. and Mexico and won't make deals with nonmarket economies like China without telling them first. The agreement includes limits on how many Chinese electric cars can come into Canada and hopes for Chinese investment in Canada's car industry.",

    "This article talks about trade between countries. Trade is when countries buy and sell goods like cars or food. Sometimes, countries put tariffs, which are extra taxes, on goods from other countries to protect their own businesses. Canada, the U.S., and China are big countries that trade a lot. Leaders like Mark Carney and Donald Trump make decisions about these trades. Free trade deals are agreements to remove tariffs, but they can be complicated because countries want to help their own people and businesses. In this case, Canada is being careful not to upset the U.S. while trying to fix trade problems with China."
