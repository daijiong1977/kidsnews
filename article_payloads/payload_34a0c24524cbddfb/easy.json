  "title": "UK Tax Rules for Cryptocurrency Users",
  "summary": "In the UK, people who buy and sell cryptocurrency now have to share their account details with tax officials. This new rule started on January 1st. The tax body, called HMRC, wants to make sure everyone pays taxes on their crypto profits, like when they sell for more money than they bought. Cryptocurrency exchanges, which are like banks for crypto, must automatically give information about users to HMRC. This helps the government collect taxes that might have been missed before. Experts say many people haven't paid their crypto taxes, and these rules will make it harder to hide gains. HMRC hopes to get millions of pounds from this over the next few years. People who made money from crypto in the last year need to file a tax return by January 31st.",

    "Cryptocurrency is a type of digital money that people use online, like Bitcoin. In the UK, the government has a tax body called HMRC that collects money from people to pay for things like schools and hospitals. When people buy and sell cryptocurrency, they can make profits, and the government wants them to pay taxes on those profits. The new rules help HMRC get information from exchanges, which are websites where people trade crypto, so they can check if taxes are paid correctly. This is important because many people might not have paid their taxes before, and the government needs this money."
