  "title": "A New Building Material That Cleans the Air",
  "summary": "Scientists at Worcester Polytechnic Institute have made a new building material that helps clean the air by taking carbon dioxide out of it. This material, called enzymatic structural material (ESM), is strong and can be used to build things like walls and roofs. It is made using an enzyme that turns carbon dioxide into solid parts, and it forms quickly without needing a lot of energy. Unlike regular concrete, which makes a lot of pollution, ESM actually captures carbon, making it better for the environment. It can be recycled and fixed if it breaks, which means less waste. This material could help build houses and other structures in a way that is good for the planet.",

    "This article is about a new building material that helps fight climate change by removing carbon dioxide from the air. Carbon dioxide is a gas that comes from things like cars and factories and can make the Earth warmer. Building materials like concrete are used a lot but can harm the environment. Scientists are working on new ideas, like ESM, to build things in a cleaner way. Learning about this helps us understand how science can solve big problems and protect our planet for the future."
