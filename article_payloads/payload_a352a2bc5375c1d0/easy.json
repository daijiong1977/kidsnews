  "title": "Supreme Court Case About Presidential Power",
  "summary": "The Supreme Court is hearing a case about whether the president can fire people from independent government agencies. These agencies, like the Federal Trade Commission, are supposed to work without too much control from the president. A commissioner named Rebecca Slaughter was fired by President Trump, and she sued because she thinks commissioners can only be fired for bad reasons like not doing their job. The case could change how presidents have been limited for 90 years. Lawyers for Trump say agencies have too much power, but some justices worry this could upset the balance of government. The court will decide if the president has more power over these agencies.",

    "The Supreme Court is like the top judge in the U.S. that decides important legal questions. Independent agencies are parts of the government, such as the Federal Trade Commission, that make rules and enforce laws without the president telling them what to do all the time. This helps keep things fair and balanced. Presidents have not been able to easily fire people from these agencies for a long time to protect their independence. This case is about whether that should change, which could give the president more control."
