  "title": "Jupiter's Hidden Secrets in Its Clouds",
  "summary": "Jupiter is a giant planet with thick clouds that cover its surface, making it hard to see what's underneath. Scientists have used a new computer model to learn more about Jupiter without going there. They found that Jupiter has more oxygen than the sun, which helps us understand how planets form. Jupiter has big storms like the Great Red Spot, which is twice the size of Earth and has been around for hundreds of years. Spacecraft like Galileo and Juno help study Jupiter from space, but the clouds are so dense that it's tricky to explore inside. This research uses chemistry and movement of gases to solve mysteries about Jupiter's atmosphere.",
