  "title": "Big Cars in Cities: A Growing Problem",
  "summary": "Cars are getting bigger and heavier in the UK and Europe, and many people like them because they are seen as practical and safe. However, some cities like Paris and Cardiff are making rules to charge more for parking big cars because they cause more pollution and damage roads. Big cars can also be more dangerous in accidents. Some people, like a dad named Matt, need big cars for work and family, but cities want to protect the environment and make streets safer. This article talks about the debate between people who love big cars and cities trying to stop them from spreading too much.",

    "This article discusses how cars in Europe are growing in size, a trend called 'carspreading.' While many consumers prefer larger vehicles for their practicality and safety, cities like Paris and Cardiff are implementing higher parking fees for heavy cars to address environmental and safety concerns. The debate highlights the conflict between individual needs, such as families and businesses relying on big cars, and city efforts to reduce pollution and improve road safety. Understanding this helps kids learn about urban planning and environmental issues in simple terms."
