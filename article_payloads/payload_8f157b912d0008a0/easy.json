  "summary": "In 2025, Taylor Swift and KPop stars were the biggest music hits. Taylor Swift's album 'The Life of a Showgirl' sold the most copies worldwide. Rosé from Blackpink had the top song 'APT' with Bruno Mars, which got over two billion streams. This song has some Korean words and is the first non-English song to be number one globally. Another KPop group, Huntr/x, had the second biggest song 'Golden'. The IFPI, a music group, made these charts. Many songs in the top 10 were from earlier years, and no British artists were in the top 10. This shows how popular KPop and Taylor Swift are around the world.",
