  "title": "Kosovo's Prime Minister Wins Big in Early Election",
  "summary": "In Kosovo, a country in Europe, Prime Minister Albin Kurti's party won a big victory in an early election. The election happened on Sunday, and his party, called Vetevendosje, got almost half of all votes. This means he will likely stay as prime minister. The election was called early because his party could not form a government after another election in February, which caused a long delay. Kurti said they have a lot of work to do now. Supporters celebrated in the capital city, Pristina. Kosovo is a young country that became independent from Serbia in 2008 after a war. The country has not approved a budget for next year, which worries people about the economy. About 44% of voters turned out to vote.",

    "Kosovo is a small country in the Balkans region of Europe. It declared independence from Serbia in 2008 after a war in the late 1990s. Elections are held to choose leaders like the prime minister, who runs the government. Sometimes, if a party cannot form a government after an election, a new election is called early to try again. This article talks about an early election where Prime Minister Albin Kurti's party won by a large margin, meaning many people voted for them."
