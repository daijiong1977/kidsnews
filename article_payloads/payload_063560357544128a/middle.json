  "title": "Kosovo's Snap Election Results: Kurti's Party Secures Clear Victory",
  "summary": "Preliminary results from Kosovo's snap parliamentary election indicate that Prime Minister Albin Kurti's Vetevendosje party has won convincingly, securing nearly 50% of the votes. This outcome positions Kurti for another term, following an early election called due to a political deadlock after the February 9 election, where his party also won but failed to form a government. The opposition Democratic Party of Kosovo and Democratic League of Kosovo trailed significantly with 21% and 14% respectively. Kurti celebrated the victory as historic and emphasized the need to quickly form a new government and parliament. The election saw a turnout of around 44%, and it occurred amidst concerns over Kosovo's economy, as the country has not approved a budget for the upcoming year. Kosovo, which declared independence from Serbia in 2008 after a war, faces ongoing challenges, including the upcoming presidential election in March. Supporters gathered in Pristina to celebrate, highlighting the significance of this political shift.",
