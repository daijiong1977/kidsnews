  "title": "Pizza-Shaped Satellites: A New Space Adventure",
  "summary": "NASA and the Space Force are testing new flat, round satellites called DiskSats that look like big pizzas. These satellites were launched into space on a rocket from Virginia. They are made of lightweight materials and have solar panels to make power. DiskSats are designed to be better than older cube-shaped satellites called CubeSats because they are thinner and can carry more equipment. The mission is to see if DiskSats work well in space for future space trips. Scientists hope they will help with space exploration and communication.",

    "Space satellites are machines that orbit Earth and help with things like communication, weather tracking, and exploration. NASA is a government agency that sends rockets and satellites into space to learn more about our universe. The Space Force is a new part of the military that protects space activities. CubeSats are small, cube-shaped satellites that have been used for many years because they are cheap and easy to build. DiskSats are a new idea to make satellites flatter and more efficient for future space missions."
