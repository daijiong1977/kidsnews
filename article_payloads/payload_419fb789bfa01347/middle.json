  "title": "Breakthrough in Storing Solar Heat with DNA-Inspired Molecules",
  "summary": "Researchers have developed a fluid-based system that stores solar energy as heat for extended periods, potentially revolutionizing heating solutions. Heating accounts for nearly half of global energy demand, largely met by fossil fuels, contributing to environmental issues. Molecular solar thermal (MOST) energy storage aims to trap energy in chemical bonds for later release, but past attempts faced challenges like low energy density and degradation. A team from UC Santa Barbara and UCLA, led by chemist Han P. Nguyen, drew inspiration from DNA damage caused by UV light. They synthesized a derivative of 2-pyrimidone, similar to thymine in DNA, which changes into a Dewar isomer under sunlight, storing energy, and snaps back to release heat on demand. This system achieved an energy storage density of 1.65 MJ/kg, nearly double that of lithium-ion batteries and higher than previous MOST materials like norbornadiene. The breakthrough involves compounded strain from fused four-membered rings, creating a molecule eager to return to its relaxed state. While promising for reusable heating fuels, practical applications require overcoming issues like solvent use. This innovation could enable seasonal heat storage, using summer sunlight for winter warmth, advancing renewable energy efforts.",

    "Heating is a major global energy consumer, with two-thirds sourced from fossil fuels, driving climate change. Solar energy offers a clean alternative, but heat storage lags behind electricity storage in batteries. Molecular solar thermal (MOST) systems store energy in chemical bonds, releasing it as heat later. Past efforts struggled with low performance, but new research leverages DNA-inspired chemistry to create rechargeable fuels. Understanding concepts like energy density and molecular strain helps appreciate this breakthrough's potential to transform heating infrastructure and support sustainability goals."
