  "title": "A Special Liquid That Saves Sunlight for Later",
  "summary": "Scientists have created a new liquid that can store sunlight as heat and release it months later, like a reusable battery for warmth. This is important because heating uses a lot of energy, often from burning fossil fuels that harm the environment. The liquid is inspired by DNA, the material in our cells that can get damaged by too much sun. When sunlight hits the liquid, it changes shape and holds energy. Later, when you need heat, it snaps back to its original shape and releases warmth without being used up. This could help heat homes in winter using summer sunlight, making energy cleaner and cheaper. The scientists made it from a chemical similar to DNA parts, and it stores more energy than old methods, but it still needs work to be used everywhere.",

    "Heating is a big part of energy use worldwide, often from burning fossil fuels like oil and coal, which cause pollution. Solar energy from the sun is clean, but storing it as heat has been hard. Scientists are working on new materials, like this DNA-inspired liquid, to save solar heat for later use, similar to how batteries store electricity. This could help make heating more sustainable and reduce environmental harm."
