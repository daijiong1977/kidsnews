  "title": "Northern Lights Light Up UK Skies with Pretty Colors",
  "summary": "The Northern Lights, also called Aurora Borealis, made the sky in the UK look green and pink on Monday night. This happens when particles from the sun hit Earth's air and make colors. People in Scotland, Northern Ireland, Wales, and parts of England saw it and sent photos to the BBC. Sometimes, the Northern Lights can be seen in other places like Italy and France too. On Tuesday, it might not be as strong or visible in the south because of clouds, but some clear skies in Scotland and Northern Ireland could still show it. The sun is very active right now, which causes more of these lights. They are safe for us but can affect technology. To see them, find a clear sky and look north, or use a camera.",

    "The Northern Lights are a natural light show in the sky caused by the sun. When the sun is very active, it sends particles to Earth that mix with the air, creating beautiful colors like green and pink. This can be seen in places like the UK, especially when the sky is clear. It's a fun event to watch, and you can take photos to see the colors better."
