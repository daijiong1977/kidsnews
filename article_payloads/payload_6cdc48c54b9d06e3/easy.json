  "title": "Prince William's Trip to Saudi Arabia: A Royal Adventure",
  "summary": "Prince William is going on a trip to Saudi Arabia because the UK government asked him to. This is his first visit there, and it is a tricky situation because Saudi Arabia is different from other countries he has visited. He will talk about energy and young people during his trip. Saudi Arabia is changing a lot—it is still ruled by a king, but it is becoming more open. For example, it now has big events like comedy shows and sports games. Some people worry about human rights in Saudi Arabia, like how women and others are treated. Prince William will meet with the leader, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, and might discuss these tough topics. His job is to help with diplomacy, so he has to be careful and smart about what he says.",
