  "title": "A Researcher's Fight Against Online Hate",
  "summary": "Imran Ahmed is a researcher from Britain who works to stop online hate and false information. The U.S. government, led by former President Trump, accused him of trying to censor people's opinions and threatened to deport him. A judge has now stopped the government from detaining or sending him away. Ahmed leads a group called the Center for Countering Digital Hate. He says his work is important to protect people, especially children, from harmful content online. He explains that his group is a nonprofit and does not censor, unlike governments. This case shows a conflict between fighting hate and free speech.",
