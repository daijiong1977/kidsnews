  "title": "A Blood Test to Find Parkinson's Early",
  "summary": "Scientists in Sweden found a way to spot Parkinson's disease before people feel sick. Parkinson's is a brain illness that makes it hard to move, and it affects millions worldwide. The researchers discovered that early changes in the body leave signs in the blood for a short time. They used smart computer programs to see these signs, which are linked to how cells fix damage and handle stress. This means doctors could use a simple blood test to find the disease years before symptoms like shaking appear. The test might be ready in about five years, helping people get treatment sooner to protect their brains. This is important because there is no cure yet, and catching it early can make a big difference.",

    "Parkinson's disease is a condition that slowly damages the brain, making it hard for people to control their movements. It often starts with small changes that go unnoticed for years. Scientists have been looking for ways to detect it early because by the time symptoms like shaking appear, a lot of brain cells are already lost. This new research offers hope by using blood tests, which are easy and cheap, to catch the disease sooner and help patients live better lives."
