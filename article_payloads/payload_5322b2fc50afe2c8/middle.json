  "title": "Chris Rea, Creator of Driving Home for Christmas, Passes Away at 74",
  "summary": "Chris Rea, the British musician renowned for the festive hit Driving Home for Christmas, has died at the age of 74. He passed away in hospital on Monday following a brief illness, surrounded by his family, as confirmed by a spokesperson. His family expressed immense sadness in a statement. Rea, who had a blues-influenced style, achieved success with multiple hits such as Auberge, On the Beach, Fool (If You Think It's Over), Let's Dance, and Road to Hell. Driving Home for Christmas, released as a single in 1988 but written in 1978, depicts a traveler navigating heavy traffic to return home and has gained renewed popularity this year through its use in the M&S Food Christmas advertisement. In a 2020 social media post, Rea explained the song's inspiration: he was unemployed, had lost his manager, and was banned from driving, so his girlfriend Joan drove him home from London, sparking the idea. He humorously noted that the song funded a vacation in the Maldives. The track has been covered by artists like Engelbert Humperdinck and Stacey Solomon. Rea also collaborated with comedian Bob Mortimer, recording Let's Dance for Middlesbrough Football Club in 1997. Tributes, including from Middlesbrough FC, highlight his status as a local icon.",
