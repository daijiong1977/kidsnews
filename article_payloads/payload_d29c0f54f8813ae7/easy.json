  "title": "Student Loans: What's Fair?",
  "summary": "The government leader Rachel Reeves says the student loan system is fair. Student loans are money students borrow for school and pay back later. She wants to keep the salary level where graduates start paying back the same for three years. This means if you earn more than £29,385, you will pay back your loan. A money expert named Martin Lewis disagrees. He says this is not fair because it treats loans like a tax, and it hurts people when prices go up. He thinks the government should change this rule. The loans are for students in England and Wales who started school between 2012 and 2023. They pay 9% of what they earn above the salary level. This issue is about balancing money for the government and helping graduates.",
