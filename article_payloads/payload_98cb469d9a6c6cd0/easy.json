  "title": "Eurovision's Big Choice About Israel",
  "summary": "Eurovision is a big singing contest where countries compete with songs. This week, leaders are meeting to decide if Israel can keep playing. Some countries like Ireland and Spain say they will not join if Israel is there because they are upset about the war in Gaza. Others, like Germany, might leave if Israel is kicked out. Last year, protesters tried to stop Israel's singer on stage, but he still came in second place. People are also arguing about voting, saying Israel's government helped them get more votes unfairly. Eurovision is making new rules to stop governments from influencing votes, like letting people vote only 10 times instead of 20. The meeting will see if these rules are enough to keep everyone happy.",
