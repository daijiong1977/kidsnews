  "title": "Taiwan Worries About China Copying U.S. Actions",
  "summary": "Taiwan is worried because China recently changed its top army general to show loyalty to its leader, President Xi Jinping. This makes Taiwan nervous, especially on an island called Kinmen that is very close to China. People in Taiwan fear that the United States capturing a leader in Venezuela might encourage China to do something similar against Taiwan. Kinmen has old defenses from the Cold War to stop invasions. The article explains how close Kinmen is to China and why this matters for Taiwan's safety.",
