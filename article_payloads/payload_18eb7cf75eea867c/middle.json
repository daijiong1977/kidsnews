  "summary": "The Bafta Film Awards, a major event in the British film industry, featured numerous notable moments this year. A significant upset occurred when Robert Aramayo, a 33-year-old actor from Hull, won the leading actor award, defeating the frontrunner Timothée Chalamet. Chalamet's film, Marty Supreme, which had 11 nominations, failed to secure any awards, adding to the drama. The event also included a royal presence, with the Prince and Princess of Wales making their first public appearance since a family arrest. Prince William, as president of Bafta, delivered a speech and discussed films like the F1 movie, praising its music by Hans Zimmer, while noting he hadn't seen Sinners due to its dark themes. The awards showcased a mix of Hollywood stars, emotional moments, and unexpected outcomes, highlighting the competitive and celebratory nature of the film industry.",
