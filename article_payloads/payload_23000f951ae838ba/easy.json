  "title": "A Tribute for a Famous French Actress",
  "summary": "In France, a politician named Éric Ciotti wants the country to honor Brigitte Bardot, a famous actress who died at age 91. Bardot was a movie star in the 1950s and 1960s and became a symbol of French freedom. Ciotti started a petition that has over 23,000 signatures to ask for a national tribute, which is a special honor for people who have done great things for France. But some other politicians, like Olivier Faure, disagree because Bardot had some controversial views and was convicted for hate speech. Bardot also loved animals and worked to protect them after she stopped acting. The mayor of Nice plans to name a place after her. This debate shows how people remember her for both her movies and her personal life.",

    "Brigitte Bardot was a famous French actress who became a movie star in the 1950s. She is known for her roles in films like 'And God Created Woman.' After retiring from acting, she focused on animal welfare, which means she worked to help animals. In France, national tributes are special honors given to people who have done important things for the country, like helping with laws or culture. This article talks about a debate over whether Bardot should get such an honor because some people remember her for her movies and animal work, while others point out she said hurtful things that led to legal trouble."
