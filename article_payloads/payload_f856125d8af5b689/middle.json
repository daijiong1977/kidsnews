  "Article_Structure": [
    "This article reports on Ons Jabeur's pregnancy announcement, with main points including her personal milestone and planned break from tennis. The purpose is to share joyful news and discuss the intersection of athletics and family life, potentially inspiring others. Evidence evaluation shows the article relies on a credible source (BBC) but lacks detailed sources or data, making it more anecdotal. Author credibility is assumed through BBC's reputation, though specific expertise isn't stated. Methodology involves reporting based on public announcements, without original research, which is standard for news articles but limits in-depth analysis."
