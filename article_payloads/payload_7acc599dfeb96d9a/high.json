  "title": "Navigating Political Discourse in Family Settings During Thanksgiving",
  "summary": "The article delves into the complexities of interpersonal communication during Thanksgiving gatherings, where increased family interaction often exacerbates tensions, particularly around political topics. Drawing from a PBS News/NPR/Marist poll, it reveals that a substantial majority of Americans encounter difficulties in political dialogues, with 85% of Democrats perceiving Republicans as closed-minded and 82% of Republicans reciprocating this view towards Democrats. Through qualitative insights from poll respondents, the piece underscores a pervasive lack of civility in contemporary political discourse. Amna Nawaz, in collaboration with advice columnist R. Eric Thomas, provides expert commentary on effective communication strategies, such as active listening and empathy, to mitigate conflict. This analysis not only addresses immediate holiday challenges but also reflects broader societal issues of polarization, aiming to equip readers with skills to foster more nuanced and respectful conversations in diverse settings.",
