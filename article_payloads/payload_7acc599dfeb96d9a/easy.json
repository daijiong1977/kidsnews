  "title": "Talking Nicely at Thanksgiving",
  "summary": "During Thanksgiving, many families get together to share a meal and spend time with each other. But sometimes, when people talk about politics or other sensitive topics, it can lead to arguments and hurt feelings. A poll from PBS NewsHour, NPR, and Marist found that most Americans find it hard to discuss politics with those who have different views. For example, many Democrats think Republicans are closed-minded, and many Republicans feel the same about Democrats. The article gives tips from experts on how to have better conversations, like listening carefully and staying calm. It's important to be kind and respectful, even when you disagree, to make the holiday enjoyable for everyone.",
