  "title": "Engineering a Healthier Sugar Alternative: Tagatose Production Breakthrough",
  "summary": "Researchers at Tufts University have developed an innovative method to produce tagatose, a rare sugar that mimics the taste of table sugar while offering health advantages. Tagatose occurs naturally in small amounts in dairy products and fruits, but its scarcity makes extraction impractical. The team engineered Escherichia coli bacteria to act as biological factories, using glucose as a starting material. By incorporating enzymes from slime mold and other sources, the bacteria efficiently convert glucose into tagatose with yields up to 95%, a significant improvement over traditional methods that yield 40-77%. Tagatose provides 92% of sucrose's sweetness with 60% fewer calories and has FDA approval as safe. It minimally affects blood glucose and insulin levels, benefiting individuals with diabetes, and may inhibit cavity-causing bacteria, promoting oral health. This biosynthetic approach could revolutionize sweetener production by making tagatose more affordable and accessible for food applications.",

    "Sugar alternatives have been sought for over a century to address health concerns like obesity and diabetes. Tagatose is a naturally occurring sugar found in trace amounts in dairy and fruits, but it is rare and expensive to produce. Traditional methods involve using galactose, but researchers at Tufts University developed a more efficient biosynthetic approach. By genetically modifying E. coli bacteria with enzymes from slime mold, they enable high-yield conversion of glucose to tagatose. This breakthrough could make tagatose a viable commercial sweetener, offering benefits such as reduced calorie intake, lower impact on blood sugar, and improved oral health, aligning with global efforts to combat diet-related diseases."
