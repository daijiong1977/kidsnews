  "title": "A New Sweet Sugar That's Better for You",
  "summary": "Scientists have found a new sugar called tagatose that tastes like regular sugar but is healthier. It comes from milk and fruits, but there isn't much of it in nature. Researchers at Tufts University made a special way to produce more tagatose using tiny bacteria. These bacteria are changed to turn glucose, a common sugar, into tagatose. Tagatose is almost as sweet as table sugar but has fewer calories, so it might help people avoid weight gain and tooth decay. It is safe to eat and doesn't raise blood sugar much, which is good for people with diabetes. This new sugar could be used in foods to make them sweet without the bad effects of regular sugar.",

    "Sugar is a sweet substance we eat in foods, but too much can cause health issues like cavities and weight gain. Scientists have been trying to find healthier sweeteners. Tagatose is a rare sugar found in small amounts in milk and fruits. Researchers at Tufts University developed a new method using bacteria to produce more tagatose, making it easier to use in foods. This could help people enjoy sweetness without the bad effects of regular sugar."
