  "title": "Medicine Helps Fight Cancer",
  "summary": "A new study found that medicines called Wegovy and Ozempic can help people with colon cancer live longer. These drugs are used for diabetes and weight loss, but scientists discovered that patients taking them had much lower chances of dying from cancer. The researchers think the drugs work by reducing inflammation and helping the body's metabolism. Now, they want to do more tests to see if these drugs can really fight cancer. This is exciting because it could lead to new ways to treat cancer and save lives.",

    "Colon cancer is a disease that affects the large intestine and can be very serious. Medicines like Wegovy and Ozempic are often used to help people with diabetes or obesity by controlling blood sugar and reducing appetite. Scientists study these drugs to see if they can help with other health problems, like cancer. This research is important because finding new treatments can save lives and improve health for many people."
