  "summary": "A new study found that people who have a sleep problem called sleep apnea and do not treat it are more likely to get Parkinson's disease. Parkinson's is a sickness that affects the brain and makes it hard to move. The study looked at over 11 million veterans in the U.S. and showed that using a machine called CPAP to help with breathing during sleep can lower the risk. Sleep apnea happens when someone stops breathing many times while sleeping, which can hurt the brain over time. Doctors say it is important to treat sleep apnea to stay healthy and protect the brain. This research helps us understand how good sleep can keep our brains safe.",

    "Sleep apnea is a common sleep disorder where a person's breathing stops and starts repeatedly during the night. This can lead to poor sleep and low oxygen levels, which might harm the brain over time. Parkinson's disease is a condition that affects movement and gets worse slowly, often in older adults. CPAP machines are used to keep airways open during sleep, helping people breathe better. This study shows that treating sleep apnea could help prevent brain diseases like Parkinson's, emphasizing the importance of good sleep for overall health."
