  "summary": "Keith Lee was named Creator of the Year at the inaugural TikTok Awards in the US, a fan-voted ceremony hosted by La La Anthony at the Hollywood Palladium in Los Angeles. The event recognized content creators across fourteen categories, including Storyteller of the Year and Live Creator of the Year, with presenters like Paris Hilton and Jordan Chiles. Winners included Jeremiah Brown for Rising Star and Bretman Sacayanan for Video of the Year, while performances featured Ciara and Mr Fantasy. Coinciding with the awards, TikTok's Chinese owner ByteDance signed a deal to sell a majority of its US operations to investors like Oracle and Silver Lake, retaining a minority stake. This agreement, set to close on January 22, aims to address US national security concerns and ensure TikTok's continued operation for over 170 million American users. The ceremony streamed on TikTok and Tubi, blending entertainment with significant corporate developments.",
