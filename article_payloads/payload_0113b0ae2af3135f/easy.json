  "title": "Famous People in Secret Files",
  "summary": "The US government released some secret files about a man named Jeffrey Epstein. These files have pictures and videos of famous people like former President Bill Clinton and others. Being in the files does not mean these people did anything wrong. Many have said they did not know about Epstein's bad actions. The files show old photos of Clinton, and his spokesperson says they are from long ago and not important. The files also mention another famous person, but everyone should remember that just being named does not prove anything. The government was supposed to release all the files by a deadline, but some people are upset because not everything was shared and parts are hidden.",
