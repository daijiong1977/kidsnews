  "title": "US Reduces Taxes on Italian Pasta",
  "summary": "The United States was planning to add very high taxes on pasta from Italy, which could have made pasta much more expensive for American shoppers. These taxes are called tariffs, and they are paid by people who bring products from other countries. The US government thought Italian companies were selling pasta too cheaply, which might hurt American pasta makers. But now, the US has decided to lower these taxes a lot. Italy said this is good news and shows that Italian companies worked well with the US. One brand will have a very low tax, while others will have a bit higher. This change helps keep pasta prices from going up too much.",
