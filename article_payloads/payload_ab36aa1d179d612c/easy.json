  "title": "No Phones at School: A New Rule for Kids in England",
  "summary": "In England, the Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson has told all schools to make sure students do not use phones during the school day. This means no phones in class, at break times, or at lunch. Teachers are also advised not to use their phones in front of students. The government wants schools to follow this new rule to help kids focus on learning. Some people, like a head teachers' union, think using inspectors to check on this rule is not helpful. The government says this rule is clearer than before. This is part of a bigger plan to keep kids safe online, including possibly banning social media for children under 16.",

    "In England, schools have rules to help students learn better. Phones can be distracting because kids might play games or text instead of paying attention in class. The government makes guidelines for schools to follow, and inspectors check if schools are doing a good job. Recently, there has been talk about keeping children safe on the internet, which includes limiting phone use at school."
