  "title": "Critics Debate the New Wuthering Heights Film Adaptation",
  "summary": "Emerald Fennell's new film adaptation of Wuthering Heights, starring Jacob Elordi and Margot Robbie, has sparked divided opinions among critics ahead of its Valentine's weekend release. Based on Emily Brontë's classic gothic novel about the intense and destructive love between Cathy and Heathcliff, the movie updates the story with modern elements, including controversial BDSM-inspired scenes and a soundtrack by Charli XCX. Critics are split: some, like Peter Bradshaw of The Guardian, criticize it as emotionally hollow and overly stylized, giving it two stars and calling it a misfire. In contrast, Robbie Collin of The Telegraph awards it five stars, defending it as resplendently lurid and arguing that style can be substance when executed well. Other reviews, such as from The Sun and The Independent, highlight concerns about the film replacing literary depth with romance novel tropes and pantomime performances, while acknowledging its fierce and fun aspects. The film is marketed with quote marks to indicate Fennell's personal take, set in the late 18th and early 19th centuries, and has generated attention for its casting and provocative content.",
