  "title": "Babies Get Sick from Bad Milk Powder in the UK",
  "summary": "In the UK, 36 babies got sick after drinking contaminated baby formula. The formula was made by Nestle and Danone, and it had a toxin called cereulide in it. This toxin can make babies vomit and have diarrhea. The babies are all around one year old or younger, but none are very sick. The UK Health Security Agency is watching the situation and says not many children seem affected so far. Parents should stop using the recalled formula and switch to a different one. The toxin was found in an ingredient called arachidonic acid oil, which is added to help babies grow. The UK is not the only country with this problem.",

    "Baby formula is a special milk powder for babies who are not breastfed. Sometimes, food can get contaminated with harmful things called toxins, which can make people sick. In this case, a toxin called cereulide was found in some baby formula from big companies like Nestle and Danone. When babies drink this, they might vomit or have diarrhea. The UK Health Security Agency helps keep people safe by checking on these problems and telling parents what to do. Recalls happen when products are unsafe, so it's important to listen to warnings and switch to safe alternatives."
