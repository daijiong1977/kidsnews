  "title": "A New Kind of Baby Diabetes Found by Scientists",
  "summary": "Scientists have discovered a new type of diabetes that affects newborn babies. They used special tools like DNA sequencing and stem cells to find out what causes it. They found that a gene called TMEM167A is not working right in some babies, which makes their insulin-producing cells stop working. Insulin is important for controlling sugar in our bodies. This discovery helps doctors understand why some babies get diabetes and have other health problems like seizures. It might also help find better treatments for diabetes in the future. The research was done by scientists from different countries working together.",

    "Diabetes is a condition where the body cannot properly use sugar from food, which can make people feel sick. Insulin is a hormone that helps the body use sugar for energy. Genes are like instructions in our bodies that tell cells what to do. Scientists study genes to understand diseases. Stem cells are special because they can become many different types of cells, helping researchers learn how diseases work. This article talks about a rare type of diabetes in babies and how scientists found a gene that causes it, which might help improve health care for everyone."
