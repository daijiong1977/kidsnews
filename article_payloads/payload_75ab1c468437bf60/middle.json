  "title": "Unveiling Solar Storms: How Spacecraft Track the Sun's Most Active Regions",
  "summary": "The Sun rotates approximately every 28 days, limiting Earth-based observations to about two weeks per active region. To overcome this, the European Space Agency launched Solar Orbiter in 2020, which orbits the Sun every six months and provides views of the far side. Between April and July 2024, Solar Orbiter captured detailed data on NOAA 13664, an exceptionally active solar region that triggered the strongest geomagnetic storms since 2003, producing auroras visible as far south as Switzerland. An international research team led by scientists like Ioannis Kontogiannis and Louise Harra combined Solar Orbiter's far-side observations with continuous data from NASA's Solar Dynamics Observatory, which monitors the Sun from the Earth-Sun line. This integration enabled nearly uninterrupted tracking of NOAA 13664 for 94 days, marking the longest continuous image series for a single active region in solar physics. The study highlights how magnetic fields in these regions, formed by magnetized plasma rising from the Sun's interior, become unstable and release energy, driving solar storms. This research advances our understanding of solar activity and improves prediction models for space weather events that can impact Earth.",

    "Solar physics involves studying the Sun's behavior, including active regions where magnetic activity is high. These regions can lead to solar storms, which emit particles and radiation affecting space weather. Geomagnetic storms, caused by interactions between solar energy and Earth's magnetosphere, result in auroras and can disrupt satellites, power grids, and communications. Spacecraft like Solar Orbiter and NASA's Solar Dynamics Observatory are essential for monitoring the Sun, as they provide data from different perspectives, helping scientists predict and mitigate impacts of solar events. Understanding magnetic fields and plasma dynamics is key to advancing solar research and protecting technological infrastructure on Earth."
