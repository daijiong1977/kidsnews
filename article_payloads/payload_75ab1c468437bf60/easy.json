  "title": "Watching the Sun's Big Storm with Spacecraft",
  "summary": "The Sun spins slowly, so we can only see parts of it for two weeks at a time from Earth. A spacecraft called Solar Orbiter, launched by the European Space Agency in 2020, helps us see more. It orbits the Sun every six months and can look at areas we normally can't see, like the far side. In 2024, Solar Orbiter watched a very active solar region called NOAA 13664 for a long time. This region caused big geomagnetic storms on Earth, making beautiful auroras visible in places like Switzerland. Scientists combined data from Solar Orbiter and another spacecraft, NASA's Solar Dynamics Observatory, to study NOAA 13664 for 94 days without stopping. This is the longest continuous observation of a solar region ever, helping us learn how magnetic fields on the Sun create storms.",
