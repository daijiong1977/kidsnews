  "title": "NASA's Decision to Evacuate ISS Crew Due to Medical Emergency",
  "summary": "NASA has ordered a controlled medical evacuation from the International Space Station, bringing home four of the seven crew members after an unspecified medical incident involving one astronaut. The affected crew member, part of the Crew-11 mission launched in August, is reported as stable, but NASA is exercising caution by returning the entire Crew-11 team early. The astronauts, including Commander Zena Cardman and Pilot Mike Fincke, will undock in their SpaceX Crew Dragon spacecraft and splash down in the Pacific Ocean. NASA officials, such as Administrator Jared Isaacman and Chief Medical Officer Dr. JD Polk, emphasize that astronaut health is the highest priority, though details are withheld for privacy. The incident occurred independently of spacewalk preparations, and the crew responded promptly using their emergency training. The space station is equipped with medical gear, and NASA is coordinating the return schedule while maintaining transparency about safety protocols.",

    "The International Space Station is a collaborative orbital laboratory involving NASA, Roscosmos, and other agencies, hosting astronauts for scientific research. NASA's Crew-11 mission is part of commercial crew programs with SpaceX, using the Crew Dragon for transport. Medical emergencies in space pose unique challenges due to microgravity, limited resources, and isolation, requiring extensive training and equipment. NASA's protocols prioritize safety, with evacuation options like controlled returns to ensure timely medical care on Earth."
