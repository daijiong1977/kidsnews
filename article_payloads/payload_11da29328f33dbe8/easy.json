  "title": "Astronauts Come Home Early from Space Station for Health",
  "summary": "NASA has decided to bring four astronauts home early from the International Space Station because one of them had a medical problem. The astronaut is safe and stable, but NASA wants to be extra careful. The astronauts are part of Crew-11, which includes Commander Zena Cardman, Pilot Mike Fincke, and others from Japan and Russia. They will return to Earth in their SpaceX Crew Dragon spacecraft, landing in the Pacific Ocean. NASA is not sharing details about the medical issue to protect the astronaut's privacy. The crew is well-trained to help each other in emergencies, and the space station has medical equipment. This shows that astronaut health is NASA's top priority.",
