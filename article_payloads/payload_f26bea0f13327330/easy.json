  "title": "Leon Boss Sees Chance with Weight Loss Shots",
  "summary": "The boss of a fast-food chain called Leon thinks weight loss jabs are a good chance for his company. John Vincent says Leon serves food that is low in sugar and uses herbs and spices, which is what people taking these jabs want to eat. He believes helping people get enough protein and keep their muscles strong is important, just like counting calories. Leon might need to change portion sizes because the jabs make people eat less. The company is also facing problems like high taxes and costs, which make it hard to make money on the High Street. Leon is closing some stores and opening new ones in places like airports to try to do better.",

    "Weight loss jabs are medicines that help people lose weight by reducing their appetite. Fast-food chains like Leon sell quick meals, and they need to adapt to changes in what people want to eat. Taxes are fees businesses pay to the government, which can affect how much money they make. The High Street is a common place for shops, but it can be tough to run a business there due to high costs."
