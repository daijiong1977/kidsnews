  "title": "Who Decides Greenland's Future?",
  "summary": "Greenland is a big island that belongs to Denmark, but it has its own government. Recently, the US president said he wants Greenland for America's safety. Greenland's leader and Denmark's leader both said no, it's not for sale. The UK prime minister, Sir Keir Starmer, agrees with them. He told the BBC that only Greenland and Denmark should decide what happens to Greenland. He said Denmark is a friend and part of NATO, so it's important to respect their choice. The article also talks about other things, like the US taking action in Venezuela, but Sir Keir didn't give a clear answer on that. Overall, this story is about who gets to make decisions for Greenland.",

    "Greenland is a large island near the Arctic that is part of Denmark but has its own government. Denmark is a country in Europe and works with other countries in NATO for protection. Leaders like prime ministers make big decisions for their countries. Sometimes, other countries might want to take over land, but it's important to respect who owns it. This article talks about a disagreement over who should decide what happens to Greenland."
