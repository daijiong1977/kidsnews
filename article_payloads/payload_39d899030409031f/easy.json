  "title": "A News Anchor Asks for Her Mom Back",
  "summary": "Savannah Guthrie is a famous news anchor on TV. She and her family made a video to ask for their mom, Nancy Guthrie, to come home safely. Nancy went missing from her house in Tucson, Arizona, last weekend, and police think someone took her. The family says they will pay to get her back, but they did not say how much. Police are looking for clues and offering a reward of $50,000 for information. They found that a doorbell camera was removed and a pacemaker app was disconnected. The FBI is checking a possible ransom note sent to news stations. The family has made other videos too, hoping to talk to the kidnapper and see proof that Nancy is okay. They are very worried and want her back soon.",
