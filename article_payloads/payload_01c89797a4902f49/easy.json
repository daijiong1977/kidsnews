  "title": "Two Towns Find New Freedom After a Tough Past",
  "summary": "Colorado City and Hildale are two towns on the border of Arizona and Utah that used to be controlled by a religious group called the FLDS. This group had strict rules, like no sports or fun activities, and their leader, Warren Jeffs, was sent to jail for hurting children. After courts took control away from the group, the towns changed quickly. Now, people can play soccer, go to bars, and enjoy life more freely. Some former members remember good times growing up there, but things got bad when Jeffs was in charge. He broke up families and made kids leave school. The towns were founded long ago by people who wanted to practice polygamy, which means having more than one wife. Today, after years of change, the towns are free from court supervision and people are happy with their new lives.",

    "Colorado City and Hildale are small towns in the United States, located on the border between Arizona and Utah. They were founded by a religious group that believed in polygamy, which is not common in most places. For many years, the group had a lot of control over people's lives, with strict rules about what they could do. The leader, Warren Jeffs, made bad decisions that hurt families and children. After he went to jail, courts stepped in to help the towns become more normal, allowing activities like sports and social events. This story shows how communities can change for the better when people work together to overcome tough times."
