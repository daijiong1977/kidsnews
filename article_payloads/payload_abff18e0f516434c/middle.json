  "summary": "This news wrap covers multiple international stories from a recent day. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy reported a productive discussion with U.S. negotiators, including special envoy Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner, regarding a draft peace plan to end the ongoing war with Russia. The proposal involves potential troop withdrawals and establishing a demilitarized zone in eastern Ukraine, though its acceptance depends on Russian agreement and a Ukrainian referendum. In a separate event, Pope Leo, during his first Christmas Day sermon as pontiff, condemned the treatment of Palestinians in Gaza and urged an end to global conflicts, emphasizing dialogue and offering blessings for peace. Additionally, a Powerball player in Arkansas won a massive $1.8 billion jackpot, adding a festive highlight.
