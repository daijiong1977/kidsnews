  "title": "Asia's Trade Troubles After Court Ruling",
  "summary": "A big court in the United States said that many of the tariffs, which are taxes on goods from other countries, announced by President Trump in 2025 are not allowed. This means the U.S. will stop collecting some of these taxes, but Trump plans to put new global taxes of 15% on goods coming into the U.S. This news affects countries in Asia like India, Indonesia, and China, who had been making trade deals with the U.S. and investing money there. While the new tax rate might help some Asian countries that had higher taxes before, there is still a lot of uncertainty. Experts say that even if countries try to negotiate, the U.S. government still wants higher tariffs. Smaller Asian countries are worried about upsetting Trump because their success depends on their relationship with him. Governments in Asia are now checking what this means for them, and China is assessing the ruling as it prepares to host Trump for a meeting. The U.S. trade representative says this won't affect talks with China, which are about making sure China buys American products like farm goods and airplanes.",

    "Trade is when countries buy and sell goods from each other. Tariffs are taxes that make goods from other countries more expensive. Sometimes, countries argue about tariffs, which can lead to trade wars where everyone loses. Courts can decide if tariffs are fair or not. In this article, a U.S. court said some tariffs by President Trump are illegal, causing changes that affect Asian countries who trade with the U.S. This shows how decisions in one country can impact many others around the world."
