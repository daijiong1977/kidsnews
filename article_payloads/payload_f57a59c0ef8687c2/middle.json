  "title": "Zverev Advances to Australian Open Semi-Finals with Dominant Serve",
  "summary": "In the Australian Open quarter-finals, German third seed Alexander Zverev defeated American youngster Learner Tien in a four-set match, crediting his serve as the decisive factor. Zverev, a three-time Grand Slam finalist, showcased a serving masterclass with 24 aces and only one double fault, winning 76% of his first-serve points and saving all three break points. Tien, aged 20 and ranked 29th, aimed to become the youngest semi-finalist in Melbourne in 34 years but was outplayed by Zverev's powerful serves. Zverev praised Tien's baseline play as 'unbelievable' but acknowledged that without his aces, he likely would not have won. Additionally, Zverev highlighted his recovery from a severe ankle injury sustained in 2022, noting that this tournament marks his first pain-free play in 12 months, boosting his confidence and performance. The victory on Rod Laver Arena secures Zverev's 10th Grand Slam semi-final appearance, emphasizing the role of serve in modern tennis and the importance of physical health in athletic success.",
