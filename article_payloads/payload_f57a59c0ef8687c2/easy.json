  "title": "Tennis Player Wins Big Match with Great Serves",
  "summary": "Alexander Zverev is a tennis player from Germany. He played a match against Learner Tien, a younger player from the United States, in the Australian Open tournament. Zverev won the match because his serves were very strong. He hit many aces, which are serves that the other player cannot hit back. Zverev said that Tien played well from the baseline, but his own serves helped him win. Zverev is happy because he is playing without pain for the first time in a year after an injury. The match was on Rod Laver Arena in Melbourne, Australia. Zverev is now in the semi-finals, which means he is one step closer to winning the tournament.",
