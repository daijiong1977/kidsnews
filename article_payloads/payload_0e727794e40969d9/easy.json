  "title": "How Small Groups Built Easter Island Statues",
  "summary": "Easter Island is famous for its giant statues called moai, built about 800 years ago from volcanic rock at a place called Rano Raraku. Archaeologists made a 3D model of the quarry using drones and photos to learn how the statues were made. They found that small family groups, not one big boss, carved the moai. The statues were moved by 'walking' them with ropes, needing only 18 to 50 people. The model shows different carving styles, meaning each group had its own way of working. This helps us understand how people long ago worked together to create amazing things.",

    "Easter Island is a remote island in the Pacific Ocean, known for its mysterious giant stone statues called moai. People built them around 800 years ago, but how they did it has been a puzzle. Archaeologists use tools like drones and computers to study old sites without damaging them. This article shows how new technology helps us learn about ancient cultures and their teamwork."
