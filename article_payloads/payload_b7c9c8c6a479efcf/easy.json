  "title": "Why Methane Gas Increased After 2020",
  "summary": "After 2020, methane gas in the air went up very fast. Methane is a gas that can make the Earth warmer. Scientists found two main reasons for this. First, there were fewer chemicals in the air that break down methane. These chemicals are called hydroxyl radicals. Second, the weather got wetter in many tropical areas because of a climate pattern called La Niña. This wet weather made more flooded lands, like wetlands, rivers, and lakes, where tiny microbes produce methane. Also, farmed areas like rice fields added more methane. The methane level rose by 55 parts per billion from 2019 to 2023, reaching a record high. The biggest jump was in 2021. Scientists say that as the planet gets warmer and wetter, methane from these natural and farmed places will keep increasing, making climate change worse. They warn that plans to reduce methane need to think about these climate-driven sources too.",

    "Methane is a greenhouse gas that comes from natural sources like wetlands and from human activities like farming. It is important because it contributes to climate change by trapping heat in the atmosphere. Scientists study methane levels to understand how our planet is changing and to find ways to reduce its impact."
