  "title": "ATP Implements Heat Safety Measures for Tennis Players",
  "summary": "The ATP has announced a new extreme heat rule set to take effect in the 2026 season, aimed at enhancing player safety during men's professional tennis matches. This rule permits players to request a 10-minute cooling break in best-of-three sets singles matches when the Wet Bulb Globe Temperature (WBGT) reaches 30.1°C or higher. The WBGT is a comprehensive metric that assesses heat stress by considering temperature, humidity, wind speed, sun angle, and cloud cover. If the WBGT exceeds 32.2°C, play will be suspended entirely. During breaks, players can hydrate, change clothing, shower, and receive coaching under medical supervision. This initiative responds to recent incidents, such as at the Shanghai Masters where Holger Rune needed medical treatment and questioned officials about player safety. The ATP stated the policy strengthens protections in extreme conditions, aligning with the WTA's long-standing heat rule introduced in 1992. Players like Novak Djokovic and Emma Raducanu have highlighted brutal heat conditions at tournaments, underscoring the need for such measures to safeguard health and improve conditions for all involved.",

    "Professional tennis is often played in outdoor settings where weather conditions, particularly extreme heat, can significantly impact player performance and health. In recent years, tournaments like the Shanghai Masters and Wuhan Open have faced criticism for sweltering conditions, leading to incidents where players experienced heat-related illnesses. The ATP's new rule builds on the WTA's established protocol, using the WBGT to scientifically assess heat stress. This approach reflects a growing awareness of athlete welfare in sports, with players advocating for better protections. Understanding these developments requires knowledge of how sports organizations implement safety measures and the role of environmental factors in athletic competitions."

    "The article outlines the ATP's new extreme heat rule, highlighting its main points: implementation in 2026, use of WBGT for thresholds, and player benefits like cooling breaks. Its purpose is to address health risks from heat exposure, as seen in recent tournaments. Evidence includes player testimonials and ATP statements, though it relies on official sources without independent verification. Author credibility is assumed from BBC reporting, but specific expertise isn't detailed. Methodology involves reporting on ATP announcements and event descriptions, providing a clear but limited view of heat management in tennis."
