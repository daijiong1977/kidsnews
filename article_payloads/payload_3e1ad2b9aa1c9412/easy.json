  "title": "New Rules for Playing Tennis in Hot Weather",
  "summary": "Tennis players sometimes have to play in very hot weather, which can make them feel sick. The ATP, which is the group that runs men's tennis, has made a new rule to help players stay safe. Starting in 2026, if it gets too hot during a match, players can take a 10-minute break to cool down. They can drink water, change clothes, or take a shower. This rule uses something called WBGT to measure how hot it feels outside. If the WBGT is over 30.1 degrees Celsius, players can ask for a break. If it goes over 32.2 degrees, the match will stop. This is important because players like Holger Rune have gotten sick from the heat. The rule is like one that women's tennis has had for over 30 years. It helps keep everyone healthy and safe while playing tennis.",

    "Tennis is a sport played outdoors, and sometimes the weather gets very hot. When it's too hot, players can feel dizzy or sick, which is dangerous. Groups like the ATP make rules to protect players. In the past, some players have needed medical help because of the heat. The new rule helps by giving players breaks to cool down, similar to what women's tennis has done for many years. This makes tennis safer and more fun for everyone involved."
