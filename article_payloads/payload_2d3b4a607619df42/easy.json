  "title": "Hidden Carvers of Easter Island's Giant Statues",
  "summary": "Scientists have discovered that the big stone statues on Easter Island, called moai, were made by many different groups of people, not just one big team. Using new 3D scanning technology, they took over 11,000 photos of a quarry where the statues were carved and made a detailed 3D model. This model showed 30 separate areas where people worked, each with their own way of carving. The statues were moved along different paths, suggesting that families or small communities worked independently. This challenges the idea that building such huge statues needed a single boss or strict rules. Instead, it shows that sharing cultural knowledge helped create similar-looking statues. The study helps us understand how ancient people organized themselves and can guide future research on other archaeological sites.",

    "Easter Island, also called Rapa Nui, is a remote island in the Pacific Ocean known for its hundreds of giant stone statues called moai. These statues were carved by Polynesian settlers starting around the 13th century. People have long wondered how such large statues were made and moved without modern tools. Archaeologists study artifacts and sites to learn about past human life. This article uses new technology to explore how different groups worked together or separately to create these famous monuments."
