  "summary": "In Northern Ireland, a new plan called the Marine Protected Area (MPA) strategy is being made to help protect birds and sea animals. A charity called the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds says this plan must lead to real action, not just words. MPAs are special places in the ocean where nature is kept safe. The plan aims to protect areas like Strangford Lough better in five years. There are already 48 MPAs, but they need to be managed well with rules that are followed. Recently, many seabirds have been found dead on beaches from Spain to Scotland, which is very sad. The charity says we need to make these birds stronger to handle problems like climate change. The plan will run until 2030 to save habitats and species. Officials must check what is hurting the birds and take steps to help them recover. The most important thing now is to take action to make sure the protected areas work properly.",

A charity that cares for birds is saying that a new plan for these areas must lead to real changes, not just be a paper plan. Recently, many seabirds have died, which shows how important it is to help them. The plan aims to make sure these protected areas have rules that are followed and monitored so that birds and sea creatures can thrive. It's part of a bigger effort to fight climate change and protect nature for the future."
