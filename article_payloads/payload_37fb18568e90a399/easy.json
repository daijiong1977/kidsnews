  "title": "Wales Plans to Clean Up Dirty Water",
  "summary": "The Welsh government has announced big plans to fix water pollution in Wales. They want to make rivers cleaner and improve the water system. This includes creating a new regulator to oversee water companies, upgrading old pipes and sewers, and setting limits on spreading sewage sludge on land. The changes will take many years to put in place and need new laws and money. Environmental groups like Afonydd Cymru support the plans but want action quickly. The government says this is a 'once-in-a-generation' chance to reset how water is managed. These reforms aim to address public concerns about water quality and aging infrastructure. The new regulator will help plan long-term investments to ensure cleaner water for everyone in Wales.",
