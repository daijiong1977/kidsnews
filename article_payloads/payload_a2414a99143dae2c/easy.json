  "title": "MI5 Asked to Help in Spy Case Investigation",
  "summary": "MI5, a secret service in the UK, is being investigated for giving false information to courts. This happened in a case about a spy called Agent X, who was a neo-Nazi and hurt his girlfriend. The prime minister ordered the investigation after the BBC found out MI5 lied. A regulator named Sir Brian Leveson is checking how MI5 made these false claims. He sent a letter to the prime minister and others, asking all MI5 staff to share any information they have. The investigation team has talked to 36 people, including MI5 workers and BBC staff. They are looking for more clues and expect to finish the report by March. This is important because telling the truth in court helps keep people safe and fair.",

    "MI5 is like a secret police in the UK that works to stop bad things from happening, such as spying or attacks. Courts are where people go when there is a problem, and judges listen to facts to decide what is right or wrong. In this story, MI5 told lies in court, which is very serious because it can hurt people and make justice unfair. The investigation is like a big search to find out why this happened and make sure it doesn't happen again. It involves talking to many people to get the full story."
