  "title": "A Photographer's Story About Belonging",
  "summary": "Tailyr Irvine is a photographer from the Flathead Reservation in Montana. She takes pictures of Native American communities to show their everyday lives and strength, not just traditional clothes or sad stories. She wants people to see that Native Americans are just like everyone else. Her project is about a rule called blood quantum, which is a fraction that tells how much Native someone is. This rule can affect who Native Americans marry and have families with. Tailyr believes photography can connect people and show we are all similar. She was inspired by photos from 9/11 and now tells stories from her home to help others understand.",

    "Tailyr Irvine is a Native American photographer who grew up on the Flathead Reservation in Montana. She uses her camera to tell stories about her community, focusing on their strength and everyday life instead of stereotypes. Her project looks at blood quantum, a system that uses fractions to define Native identity, which can impact personal choices like marriage. She was inspired by powerful photos from 9/11 and wants to use photography to help people feel connected and understand each other better."
