  "title": "Exploring Identity and Belonging Through Photography",
  "summary": "Tailyr Irvine is a photojournalist from the Flathead Reservation in Montana, dedicated to capturing nuanced portrayals of Native American life. Her work challenges stereotypes by focusing on the strength and resilience of Native communities, rather than limiting images to regalia or vulnerability. Inspired by impactful photos from 9/11, she pursued photography to tell stories from her home that resonate broadly, emphasizing photography's power to foster connections and highlight shared humanity. Her recent project, 'Reservation Mathematics: Navigating Love in Native America,' investigates the U.S. government-imposed blood quantum system, which assigns fractions to Natives at birth to measure ancestry. This system influences intimate decisions like marriage and family planning, as tribes often require specific blood quantum levels for membership. Tailyr aims to document Natives as ordinary people, showcasing their diverse experiences and critiquing how external definitions shape identity and belonging in Native America.",
