    "Black Friday originated in the US as a post-Thanksgiving sales event and has expanded globally, featuring deep discounts on various products.

  "Article_Structure": [
    "This article's main points focus on promoting a 50% discount for Apple TV during Black Friday, highlighting cost savings, content library, and device compatibility. Its purpose is to inform and persuade readers to subscribe, leveraging the author's experience with the service. Evidence includes specific pricing and show examples, but relies heavily on promotional language without independent verification. The author, likely a TechRadar staffer, has credibility in tech journalism but may have bias due to affiliate incentives. Methodology involves summarizing the deal details and personal recommendations, lacking rigorous research or data analysis."
