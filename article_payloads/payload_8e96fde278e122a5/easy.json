  "title": "How Drinking Before Birth Affects Baby Monkeys' Brains",
  "summary": "Scientists studied baby monkeys before they were born to see how alcohol and stress affect their brains when they grow up. They gave some pregnant monkeys alcohol, some had stress, and some had both. When the baby monkeys became adults, the scientists looked at their brains and how they drank alcohol. They found that monkeys whose moms drank alcohol before birth had changes in their brains and drank alcohol faster. The brain changes could even predict how much they would drink later. This helps us understand why some people might have trouble with drinking as adults if their moms drank during pregnancy. The study shows it's important for pregnant moms to avoid alcohol to keep babies healthy.",

    "This study helps us learn about how things that happen before birth can affect health later. Scientists use monkeys because they are similar to humans. By studying them, we can understand why some people might have problems with drinking alcohol when they grow up. It teaches us that taking care during pregnancy is very important for a baby's future."
