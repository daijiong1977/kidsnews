  "title": "Nerves Can Heal at Any Age After a Back Injury",
  "summary": "Scientists studied how people recover after a spinal cord injury, which happens when the nerves in the back are damaged. They found that age does not stop nerves from healing. Older people and younger people both regained strength and feeling in their arms and legs similarly. However, older adults had more trouble with daily activities like walking, bathing, and eating on their own. The study followed over 2,000 patients for one year in Europe. This research helps doctors understand that age is not a barrier to nerve recovery, but older people might need extra help with everyday tasks. It could lead to better treatments for everyone with spinal cord injuries.",

    "A spinal cord injury is when the nerves in your back get hurt, which can make it hard to move or feel things. People of all ages can get these injuries from accidents or falls. Recovery means trying to get better by regaining strength and doing daily tasks. Scientists study this to help patients heal and live independently. This article talks about a big study that looked at how age affects recovery, showing that nerves heal similarly for everyone, but older people might need more support with everyday activities."
