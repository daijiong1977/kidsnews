  "summary": "Plants breathe through tiny holes on their leaves called stomata. These holes let in carbon dioxide for making food and let out water vapor. Scientists have made a new tool called Stomata In-Sight to watch this happen in real time. It helps them see how stomata open and close while measuring gases. This is important because plants need water to grow, and understanding stomata can help create crops that use less water, especially in dry areas. The tool uses special microscopes and chambers to control light and humidity, giving a live view of plant responses. This breakthrough could lead to smarter plants that survive better with less water.",

    "Plants are living things that need air and water to grow. They have small openings on their leaves called stomata that act like mouths. These stomata help plants breathe by taking in carbon dioxide for photosynthesis and letting out water vapor. Scientists study stomata to understand how plants use water, which is important for growing food in dry places. The new Stomata In-Sight tool lets scientists watch this process live, helping them learn how to make crops that need less water to survive."
