  "title": "US Wants to Get Greenland, Maybe with the Military",
  "summary": "The US government, led by President Donald Trump, is talking about getting Greenland, which is part of Denmark. They say it's important for safety. The White House mentioned they might use the military to do this. Denmark and Greenland don't want this and say Greenland belongs to its people. Other European countries like the UK and France support Denmark. They all agree that only Denmark and Greenland can decide about Greenland. The US also talked about buying Greenland instead of using force. This is causing a big argument between the US and its friends in NATO, a group of countries that help each other in war. Everyone is worried about keeping peace in the Arctic, a cold area near the North Pole.",

    "Greenland is a large island in the Arctic Ocean, and it's part of Denmark but has its own government. The US is a big country that sometimes wants to control places for safety. NATO is a group of countries like the US, UK, and France that work together to keep peace. When countries argue about land, it can lead to problems, so it's important to talk and respect each other's decisions."
