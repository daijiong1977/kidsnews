  "title": "Emma Raducanu Feels Safer After Scary Stalking",
  "summary": "Emma Raducanu is a famous tennis player from Britain who won a big tournament called the US Open in 2021. Earlier this year, a man followed her to tennis events and made her feel scared and upset. The police helped by giving him a restraining order to keep him away. Emma says she is now feeling better and not hiding anymore, but sometimes she gets creeped out when she sees photos of herself that she didn't know were taken. She is training hard and spending time at home with her family to feel safe and happy. Emma is brave and wants to focus on playing tennis again.",
