  "title": "Emma Raducanu's Psychological Recovery from Stalking: A Case Study in Celebrity Vulnerability",
  "summary": "This article examines Emma Raducanu's confrontation with stalking incidents, particularly focusing on an event in February where a man exhibiting fixated behavior followed her to successive tournaments in Dubai. Raducanu, the 2021 US Open champion, describes the distress and fear she experienced, leading to increased security measures and legal interventions such as a restraining order. She articulates a nuanced recovery, stating she has 'got over' the incident but remains unsettled by unauthorized photographs, highlighting ongoing privacy concerns. The piece contextualizes this within broader issues of celebrity vulnerability, referencing a prior 2022 stalking case where a man walked 23 miles to her home. Raducanu's current efforts to rebuild her confidence include training in Barcelona and commuting from her family home in Bromley, underscoring her pursuit of normalcy and safety. The analysis delves into the psychological impacts on athletes, the efficacy of security protocols, and the societal implications of fame-induced risks.",
