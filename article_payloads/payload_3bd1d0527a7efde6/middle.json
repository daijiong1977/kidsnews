  "title": "Celebrity Collaboration in Taylor Swift's Opalite Music Video",
  "summary": "Taylor Swift's latest music video for Opalite features a star-studded cast including Graham Norton and Lewis Capaldi, blending humor and surreal elements in a 1980s setting. The video, directed by Swift herself, stars Irish actor Domhnall Gleeson as a lonely man who uses a magic potion on his cactus to summon Swift into his life. Lewis Capaldi portrays a photographer captivated by the couple, while Graham Norton plays a salesman offering to reverse the spell. The casting was inspired by an episode of Norton's BBC chat show from October, where Gleeson joked about wanting to be in a Swift video. Swift recalled this moment on Instagram, explaining how she quickly wrote a script and invited all guests from that show, including Norton, to participate. The video premiered on Friday and includes actors like Cillian Murphy, Greta Lee, and Jodie Turner-Smith. It serves as the second single from Swift's album The Life Of A Showgirl, which was the UK's top-selling record last year, highlighting Swift's creative process and ability to turn casual conversations into artistic projects.",
