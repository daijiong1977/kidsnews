  "title": "Taylor Swift's Fun New Video with Graham Norton",
  "summary": "Taylor Swift made a new music video for her song Opalite, and it has some famous people in it! Graham Norton, who is a funny TV host, and Lewis Capaldi, a singer, both star in the video. The video is set in the 1980s and is very silly. It shows an actor named Domhnall Gleeson who uses a magic potion on his cactus to bring Taylor Swift into his life. Graham Norton plays a salesman who says he can undo the magic. The idea for the video came from a joke on Graham Norton's TV show last year, where Domhnall said he wanted to be in a Taylor Swift video. Taylor Swift thought it was a great idea and wrote a script for everyone from that show to be in the video. The video premiered on Friday, and it's part of Taylor's big album called The Life Of A Showgirl.",
