  "title": "Kansas County Pays for Police Raid on Newspaper",
  "summary": "In Kansas, Marion County has agreed to pay $3 million and say sorry for a police raid on a newspaper in 2023. This means the county admits it was wrong to send police to search the newspaper's office. At the same time, other news includes the Justice Department looking into safety at UC Berkeley after protests led to arrests, and a judge in Utah changing the voting map to help Democrats win more votes. These events show how the government and police must follow rules to protect people's rights, like the freedom of the press.",
