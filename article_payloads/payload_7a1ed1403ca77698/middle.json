  "title": "Conflict Over Ben & Jerry's Independence Leads to Chair's Removal",
  "summary": "Anuradha Mittal, who served as chair of Ben & Jerry's independent board for seven years, has accused Magnum, the company that now owns the brand, of threatening to launch a public smear campaign against her. According to Mittal, Magnum executives threatened to publish defamatory statements if she did not resign from her position. This accusation stems from an ongoing dispute regarding the independence of Ben & Jerry's board and its ability to pursue social missions without interference. Magnum responded by stating that Mittal no longer met the criteria to serve on the board, following an external investigation, and implemented new governance rules, including a nine-year term limit for board members. Additionally, two other board members are required to leave. The conflict has historical roots, as Ben & Jerry's was sold to Unilever in 2000 with provisions for an independent board, but tensions persisted over social issues like the brand's stance on Israeli-occupied territories. Recently, Unilever spun off its ice cream unit to form Magnum, which inherited these disputes. Mittal claims that for years, the board resisted efforts to muzzle its advocacy for human rights and peace, leading to the current stand-off and her removal.",

    "Ben & Jerry's is an activist ice cream company founded in Vermont, known for its social justice initiatives and playful branding. In 2000, it was acquired by Unilever, a multinational consumer goods company, under an agreement that allowed Ben & Jerry's to maintain an independent board to oversee its social mission. This arrangement often led to conflicts, particularly over issues like the brand's stance on geopolitical matters, such as its 2021 decision to stop sales in Israeli-occupied territories. Recently, Unilever restructured its business, spinning off its ice cream division to create Magnum Ice Cream Company, which now owns Ben & Jerry's. This change has intensified existing tensions, as Magnum seeks to impose stricter governance, while the board fights to preserve its autonomy and advocacy roles. The situation highlights broader debates about corporate ownership, ethical business practices, and the balance between profit and social responsibility."
