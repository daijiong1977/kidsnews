  "title": "Ice Cream Boss Says Company Tried to Hurt Her",
  "summary": "Anuradha Mittal was the chair of Ben & Jerry's, a famous ice cream company. She says that Magnum, the company that owns Ben & Jerry's, threatened to say bad things about her if she did not leave her job. This happened because there was a big fight about how independent Ben & Jerry's board should be. The board wants to keep making decisions about social issues, like helping people and peace. Magnum said Mittal did not meet the rules to stay on the board anymore and made new rules, like limiting how long people can serve. Other board members also had to leave. Mittal talked to the BBC about this problem, saying she has been trying to protect Ben & Jerry's mission for years.",

    "Ben & Jerry's is an ice cream company known for fun flavors and wanting to help society. It was bought by Unilever in 2000 but kept some freedom to make social decisions. Recently, Unilever spun off its ice cream part to create Magnum, which now owns Ben & Jerry's. There has been tension because the board at Ben & Jerry's wants to stay independent and focus on issues like human rights, but the owner wants more control. This led to Mittal being removed as chair after a dispute."
