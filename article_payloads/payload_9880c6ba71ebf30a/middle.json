  "title": "Ellie Goldstein: Breaking Barriers on Strictly Come Dancing",
  "summary": "Ellie Goldstein, a 24-year-old woman with Down's syndrome, has achieved remarkable success by dancing on BBC's Strictly Come Dancing with her partner Vito. Her journey began with a childhood dream, supported by her mother Yvonne, who defied early predictions that Ellie would never walk or talk. Ellie manifested her goal by consistently believing she would make it to Strictly, and her determination paid off when she received the life-changing call. Prior to this, she built a career as a model, featuring in Vogue, Gucci, and Adidas campaigns, and ventured into acting with a role in the BBC series Malory Towers, earning an Emmy nomination. Ellie's story is not just about personal achievement; it highlights societal progress. Yvonne recalls being advised to leave Ellie at the hospital after birth, reflecting outdated attitudes toward disabilities. Through Ellie's accomplishments, she aims to shift perceptions and demonstrate that individuals with learning disabilities can excel in diverse fields. Her ongoing participation in Strictly, dancing weekly, serves as an inspiration and a catalyst for changing how people view disability, emphasizing resilience and the power of positive thinking.",
