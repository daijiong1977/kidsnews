  "title": "Race Cars Disqualified in Las Vegas",
  "summary": "In a big car race in Las Vegas, two drivers named Lando Norris and Oscar Piastri were disqualified because their cars broke a rule. The rule is about a part called the skid block, which was too thin. Norris finished second and Piastri was fourth, but now they get no points. Norris is still leading in the championship and can win the title in the next race in Qatar if he scores more points than his rivals. This is disappointing for them, but they are focusing on the next race. The skid block helps keep the car at the right height for safety and fairness. Other drivers moved up in position because of the disqualification.",

    "Formula 1 is a popular car racing sport where drivers compete in races around the world. Each race gives points to the top finishers, and the driver with the most points at the end wins the championship. Rules are strict to keep the competition fair, and if a car doesn't meet the rules, drivers can be disqualified, meaning they lose their points. The skid block is an important part that ensures cars are safe and not too low to the ground, which could make them unfair."
