  "title": "Technical Rule Breach Leads to F1 Disqualifications",
  "summary": "Lando Norris and Oscar Piastri of McLaren were disqualified from the Las Vegas Grand Prix due to a technical infringement involving their cars' skid blocks, which were found to be below the minimum allowed depth after the race. Norris had finished second, and Piastri fourth, but the disqualification cost them valuable points in the drivers' championship. Norris now leads Max Verstappen and Piastri by 24 points heading into the penultimate race in Qatar, a sprint event where he can secure the title by earning just two more points than both rivals. The skid block is a regulatory component designed to prevent cars from running too low, which can enhance performance but is restricted for safety and fairness. This incident echoes a similar disqualification of Lewis Hamilton earlier in the season, highlighting the strict enforcement of F1 rules. Norris expressed frustration but emphasized shifting focus to Qatar for a strong performance.",
