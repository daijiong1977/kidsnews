  "title": "Big Movie Stars Miss Out on Bafta Awards List",
  "summary": "Some famous movie stars like George Clooney, Dwayne Johnson, and Julia Roberts did not make the longlist for the Bafta Film Awards this year. The Baftas are important because they often show who might win at the Oscars, which are big awards too. The longlists have been released, and a movie called One Battle After Another has the most mentions. The final nominations will be announced soon. These stars are still nominated for Golden Globes, another award show. In the past, many actors who won Baftas also won Oscars, so missing the Bafta list might mean they have less chance at the Oscars. Other actors like Adam Sandler made the longlist, and a movie called KPop Demon Hunters cannot be in the Baftas because it was on Netflix first.",
