  "title": "Big Winter Storm Causes Travel Trouble",
  "summary": "A huge winter storm is making travel very hard for people trying to get home for Thanksgiving. Snow and cold weather are causing many flight delays and dangerous roads. In some places, there is over a foot of snow, and highways are slippery. Most people are driving for the holiday, so there are big traffic jams. The government says this is one of the busiest travel weeks in years. It's important to be safe and check for updates if you are traveling. This storm is affecting many states in the central and eastern parts of the country.",
