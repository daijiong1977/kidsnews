  "title": "Winter Storm Disrupts Holiday Travel Plans",
  "summary": "A severe winter storm is significantly disrupting holiday travel across the central and eastern United States, just before Thanksgiving. Temperatures have plummeted to 20 degrees below normal, leading to extensive flight delays and hazardous road conditions. In the Upper Midwest, blizzards have deposited over 18 inches of snow, creating slick highways and stranding vehicles. AAA reports that approximately 90% of Thanksgiving travelers are driving, exacerbating traffic congestion, with some journeys extended by hours. Additionally, air travel is strained, with the FAA anticipating the busiest week in 15 years and FlightAware noting nearly 4,000 delayed flights. The combination of extreme weather and high travel volume highlights the challenges faced by millions, emphasizing the need for caution and preparedness during this peak season.",
