  "summary": "Rage bait is a new word that means online content made to make people angry on purpose. Oxford University Press, which makes dictionaries, chose it as the word of the year for 2025. This word describes tricks used on social media to get more likes, shares, and comments by making users feel mad. It beat other words like aura farming and biohack. Rage bait is like clickbait, which tries to get clicks, but it focuses on making people cross. Experts say it shows how the internet is changing to play with our feelings. Last year's word was brain rot, which talked about how scrolling too much can make your mind tired. This helps us understand how online content can affect us.",
