  "title": "Understanding Rage Bait: Oxford's 2025 Word of the Year",
  "summary": "Rage bait has been selected as the Oxford word of the year for 2025, highlighting a significant trend in online behavior. Defined by Oxford University Press as content deliberately crafted to provoke anger or outrage, rage bait represents a shift in digital engagement tactics. According to the article, usage of this term has tripled in the past year, indicating its growing relevance. It surpassed other shortlisted words like aura farming and biohack in a public vote, reflecting societal concerns about online manipulation. The concept is akin to clickbait but specifically targets emotional responses to boost traffic on social media platforms. Experts, such as Casper Grathwohl, president of Oxford Languages, note that this marks a progression from curiosity-driven clicks to emotion-driven interactions, underscoring the impact of technology on human behavior. The article connects this to last year's word, brain rot, which addressed the mental fatigue from excessive scrolling, suggesting an ongoing dialogue about digital culture's effects. This analysis helps middle school students grasp how online content can influence emotions and the importance of critical thinking when navigating social media.",
