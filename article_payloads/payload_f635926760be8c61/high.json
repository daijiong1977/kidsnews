  "title": "Rage Bait: An Analysis of Oxford's 2025 Word of the Year and Its Implications for Digital Culture",
  "summary": "Oxford University Press has designated rage bait as the word of the year for 2025, a decision that underscores evolving dynamics in online communication and engagement. According to the article, rage bait refers to digital content strategically crafted to elicit anger or outrage, with its usage surging threefold in the past year, indicating its pervasive influence in social media ecosystems. This term surpassed contenders like aura farming and biohack through a public vote, reflecting societal recognition of manipulative online practices. The analysis draws parallels to clickbait but emphasizes rage bait's specific focus on emotional provocation to drive traffic and interaction. Casper Grathwohl, president of Oxford Languages, contextualizes this trend as a shift from curiosity-based engagement to emotion-driven manipulation, highlighting broader conversations about humanity in a tech-centric world. The article connects this to prior years, such as 2024's brain rot, which addressed cognitive depletion from digital consumption, suggesting a continuum in examining digital culture's psychological impacts. For high school students, this exploration offers insights into media psychology, ethical considerations in content creation, and the importance of digital literacy in navigating an increasingly emotive online landscape.",
