  "title": "Two TV Shows Crash Together in a Big Episode",
  "summary": "Two popular TV shows, Coronation Street and Emmerdale, are having a special episode where they come together for the first time. This episode is called Corriedale and will air on Monday. The boss of the shows, Iain MacLeod, thought it would be fun to mix the characters from both shows. He got the idea from his own long drives between Manchester and Leeds, where bad weather and accidents often happen. In the episode, characters from both shows meet on a dark road at night and have a big crash. The actors had to film at night for three weeks and enjoyed spending time together. This is a one-time event to make fans excited and bring new viewers to the shows.",
