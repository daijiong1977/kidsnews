  "title": "Five People Denied US Visas for Campaigning Against Online Hate",
  "summary": "Five people, including two from the UK, were denied visas to enter the United States. The US government said they were trying to force American social media companies to remove content they don't like. The people work for groups that fight online hate and false information. European leaders, like the French president, criticized this decision, calling it intimidation. The US argued it was protecting free speech from foreign pressure. This story shows a disagreement about how to handle harmful content online between different countries.",

    "This story is about how countries sometimes disagree on how to handle problems on the internet, like hate speech or false information. In the United States, there is a strong belief in free speech, which means people can say almost anything without government interference. In Europe, some groups and laws try to make social media companies remove harmful content to protect people. When the US denied visas to campaigners from Europe, it sparked a debate about whether foreign groups should influence American companies. This shows the challenges of global cooperation on internet issues."
