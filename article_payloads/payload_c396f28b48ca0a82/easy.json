  "title": "A Whistleblower Speaks Up About Data Problems at Social Security",
  "summary": "A man named Chuck Borges, who used to work at the Social Security Administration, said that some people from Elon Musk's DOGE team did things they shouldn't have with private information. The Social Security Administration is a government agency that helps older people and others with money. The DOGE team members looked at and shared sensitive data, like Social Security numbers, without permission. This could put people's personal details at risk. Chuck Borges told his bosses about this problem, but he lost his job and felt treated unfairly. Now, the government has said that some of what he said is true. This story shows why it's important to protect private information and for people to speak up when they see something wrong.",
