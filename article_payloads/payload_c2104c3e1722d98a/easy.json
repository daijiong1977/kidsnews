  "title": "Bacteria That Eat Cancer Tumors",
  "summary": "Scientists are making a new way to fight cancer using tiny living things called bacteria. They change the bacteria so it can eat cancer tumors from the inside. The bacteria like places with no air, and the middle of tumors has no air, so it's a good home for them. The bacteria grow and eat the tumor, helping to get rid of it. But there is a problem: when the bacteria reach parts of the tumor with a little air, they die before finishing the job. To fix this, scientists add a special gene to help the bacteria survive longer. They also use a smart system called quorum sensing to control when this gene turns on, so the bacteria only get stronger when needed. This research is done by scientists at a university working with other experts to make a safe treatment.",

    "Cancer is a disease where bad cells grow too much and form lumps called tumors. Bacteria are tiny living things that can be found everywhere, like in soil or our bodies. Scientists study how to use bacteria to help people by changing their genes, which are like instructions inside them. This research is important because it might lead to new treatments that are safer and work better for fighting cancer."
