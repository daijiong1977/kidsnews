  "title": "Gold and Silver Prices Go Up and Down",
  "summary": "Gold and silver had a big year in 2025 with their prices going up and down like a rollercoaster. Gold reached a record high of over $4,500 an ounce before dropping a bit, and silver hit a high of over $80 an ounce. Experts say this happened because people expect interest rates to be cut in 2026, central banks bought more gold, and investors wanted safe assets due to worries about the economy and world tensions. However, some experts warn that after such big gains, prices might fall in 2026 as investors could sell to get cash. They think gold and silver might still go up but more slowly. This shows how precious metals can change based on what people think and do.",

    "Gold and silver are precious metals that people have valued for thousands of years. They are used in jewelry, coins, and as investments. When people are worried about the economy or world events, they often buy gold and silver because they think these metals will keep their value better than other things. Prices can go up and down based on how much people want to buy or sell them, and factors like interest rates set by banks can influence this. In 2025, many investors and central banks bought a lot of gold and silver, making prices rise to record highs, but experts warn this might not last forever."
