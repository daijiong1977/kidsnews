  "title": "Police Say Sorry to Lord Speaker for Mistake",
  "summary": "The police in London, called the Metropolitan Police, made a mistake and said sorry to the Lord Speaker, Lord Forsyth. They wrongly thought he told them something about Lord Mandelson, who is a former ambassador. Lord Mandelson was arrested because someone said he might leave the country, but his lawyers say this is not true. The police also said sorry to Sir Lindsay Hoyle, who is the Speaker of the House of Commons, because they accidentally said he gave them information. Sir Lindsay said he did share information with the police because he thought it was his duty. The police are investigating Lord Mandelson for possibly sharing secret government information with a bad person. Lord Mandelson says he did nothing wrong and wants to prove it. He was taken to a police station and then let go while they look into it more.",
