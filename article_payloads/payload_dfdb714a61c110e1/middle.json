  "title": "Met Police Apologizes to Lord Speaker Over Misidentified Tip-off",
  "summary": "The Metropolitan Police issued apologies to both the Lord Speaker, Lord Forsyth, and the Commons Speaker, Sir Lindsay Hoyle, after incorrectly identifying Lord Forsyth as the source of information leading to Lord Mandelson's arrest. Lord Mandelson, a former ambassador to the US, was arrested at his London home based on a suggestion he might flee the country, which his lawyers called 'baseless.' Sir Lindsay Hoyle admitted he provided information to police in good faith, believing it his duty, after hearing details during a visit to the British Virgin Islands. The police apologized for inadvertently revealing Sir Lindsay as the source. Meanwhile, the Met is investigating allegations that Lord Mandelson, while serving as a minister, passed market-sensitive government information to Jeffrey Epstein, a convicted sex offender. Lord Mandelson denies any criminal activity or financial motivation and intends to cooperate with police to clear his name. He was interviewed at Wandsworth police station and released on bail pending further investigation.",

    "In the UK political system, the House of Lords and House of Commons are key legislative bodies. The Metropolitan Police handle major investigations in London. Jeffrey Epstein was a financier convicted of sex offenses, whose connections have led to various probes. Market-sensitive information refers to data that can influence stock prices or economic decisions, and its misuse is a serious matter. Bail allows individuals to remain free while investigations continue, ensuring legal processes are followed without unnecessary detention."
