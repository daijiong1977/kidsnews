  "title": "Putintseva Overcomes Crowd Hostility with Mental Focus at Australian Open",
  "summary": "At the Australian Open in Melbourne, tennis player Yulia Putintseva faced a challenging third-round match against Turkish qualifier Zeynep Sonmez. The crowd was overwhelmingly supportive of Sonmez, who aimed to become the first Turkish woman to reach the fourth round of a Grand Slam in singles. This created a hostile environment for Putintseva, with fans booing her and screaming during critical points, such as between her serves. To cope, Putintseva abandoned her usual method of listening to Taylor Swift and instead mentally repeated a song about rabbits from an old Russian movie, which helped her block out distractions. She won the match in three sets: 6-3, 6-7 (3-7), 6-3. After her victory, Putintseva responded to the jeers by cupping her ear, blowing kisses, and dancing provocatively off the court. She criticized the crowd's behavior as disrespectful, noting instances like loud yelling and coughing during key shots. Despite the adversity, Putintseva maintained her composure, reaching the Australian Open fourth round for the first time and highlighting the importance of mental toughness in sports.",
