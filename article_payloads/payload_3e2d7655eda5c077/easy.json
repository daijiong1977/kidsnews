  "title": "Tennis Player Uses Rabbit Song to Win Match",
  "summary": "Yulia Putintseva is a tennis player who played a big match at the Australian Open in Melbourne. The crowd was cheering loudly for her opponent, Zeynep Sonmez, and booing Putintseva. This made it hard for Putintseva to focus. To stay calm, she sang a song about rabbits in her head from an old Russian movie instead of listening to the noise. She won the match by playing three sets. After winning, she danced and blew kisses to the crowd to respond to the boos. Putintseva said some people in the crowd were disrespectful by yelling during her serves. She was happy she stayed calm and did not get angry. This was her first time reaching the fourth round at the Australian Open.",
