  "title": "Ancient Skulls in China Tell a New Story",
  "summary": "Scientists found two old skulls in China that are about 1.77 million years old. They belong to a group called Homo erectus, which is an early human ancestor. This makes them the oldest human fossils found in East Asia. The skulls were discovered in Yunxian, near a river. Before, some people thought these skulls might be related to another group called Denisovans, but the new age shows they are too old for that. This discovery helps us learn how quickly early humans spread from Africa to Asia. It also connects to even older stone tools found in China, showing that humans might have traveled faster than we thought.",

    "This article is about ancient human fossils found in China. Scientists study old bones and tools to learn about early humans like Homo erectus, who lived millions of years ago. They use methods like measuring isotopes to figure out how old things are. This helps us understand human history and how people moved around the world long ago."
