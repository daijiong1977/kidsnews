  "title": "A Giant Dinosaur with a Big Blade on Its Head Found in the Sahara",
  "summary": "Scientists found a new dinosaur called Spinosaurus mirabilis in the Sahara Desert in Niger. A team led by Professor Paul Sereno discovered fossils, including a huge, curved crest on its head that looked like a blade. This crest was made of keratin, like our fingernails, and was probably colorful for showing off. The dinosaur had special teeth that locked together to catch slippery fish, making it a good hunter. Unlike some ideas that spinosaurids lived in the ocean, this dinosaur was found far from the sea, in a forested area with rivers, so it might have waded in shallow water like a heron. The discovery started from an old note about a tooth and involved a long adventure in the desert with help from a local guide. This find helps us learn more about how these dinosaurs lived and evolved.",

    "Dinosaurs are ancient animals that lived millions of years ago. Spinosaurids are a group of dinosaurs known for eating fish and having sail-like structures on their backs. Fossils are preserved remains or traces of these creatures, found in rocks. The Sahara is the world's largest hot desert, located in Africa. Paleontologists are scientists who study fossils to learn about prehistoric life. This discovery helps us understand how dinosaurs adapted to different environments and what they looked like."
