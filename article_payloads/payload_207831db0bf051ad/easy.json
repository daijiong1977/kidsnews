  "title": "A Top Leader in Ukraine Steps Down Over a Problem",
  "summary": "In Ukraine, a very important leader named Andriy Yermak, who was the chief of staff for President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, has resigned because of a corruption scandal. Corruption means when people in power do dishonest things for their own benefit. This is a big deal because Yermak was the second most powerful person in the country, helping the president make decisions. It happened while Ukraine is talking with the Trump administration about ending the war with Russia. The war has been going on for a long time, and Ukraine is under special rules called martial law, which gives the president more power. This resignation shows that even during a war, leaders must be honest and fair. It's important for the country's future and its fight against corruption.",
