  "title": "A Mysterious Planet Near Earth",
  "summary": "Scientists are studying a planet called TRAPPIST-1e that is about the same size as Earth. It orbits a star named TRAPPIST-1, which is smaller and cooler than our sun. This planet is in a special area called the \"Goldilocks zone,\" where it might be just right for liquid water if it has an atmosphere. Water is important because it could mean life might exist there. Astronomers used a big telescope called the James Webb Space Telescope to look at this planet. They saw hints of a gas called methane, but they are not sure if it comes from the planet or the star. More studies are needed to find out if TRAPPIST-1e has an atmosphere and if it could support life. This planet is part of a system with seven planets, all close together, and it is about 39 light-years away from Earth.",
