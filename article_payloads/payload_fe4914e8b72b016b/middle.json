  "title": "The Hidden Role of Calcifying Plankton in Climate Models",
  "summary": "A recent review published in Science highlights that calcifying plankton, microscopic organisms such as coccolithophores, foraminifers, and pteropods, are inadequately represented in climate models used to forecast Earth's future. These plankton form calcium carbonate shells, playing a crucial role in the ocean carbon pump by capturing atmospheric carbon and transporting it to deeper ocean layers, thus regulating global temperatures. The study, led by researchers from ICTA-UAB in Spain, warns that omitting these organisms leads to incomplete predictions of ocean responses to climate change. It identifies key processes like shallow dissolution, where calcium carbonate dissolves in upper ocean waters due to biological activities, which is often missing from models like CMIP6. Additionally, different plankton groups face varied climate threats: coccolithophores are vulnerable to ocean acidification, while foraminifers and pteropods risk oxygen depletion and warming. The authors urge for enhanced measurements of calcium carbonate production and dissolution to refine models, arguing this will improve understanding of carbon storage, sediment records, and ecosystem impacts, ultimately offering sharper climate predictions for societal planning.",

    "Calcifying plankton are essential components of marine ecosystems, influencing global carbon cycles and climate regulation. Climate models, such as those in CMIP6, are critical for predicting future environmental changes but often simplify biological processes. The ocean carbon pump is a natural mechanism that sequesters carbon, mitigating climate change. Understanding shallow dissolution and species-specific vulnerabilities, like ocean acidification impacts on coccolithophores, is vital for accurate modeling. This context helps middle school students grasp the interdisciplinary nature of climate science, linking biology, chemistry, and computer modeling to address real-world issues like global warming and ocean health."
