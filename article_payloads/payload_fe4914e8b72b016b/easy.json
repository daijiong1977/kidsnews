  "title": "Tiny Ocean Creatures Help Our Planet",
  "summary": "Scientists have found that tiny ocean creatures called calcifying plankton are very important for Earth's climate. These plankton are so small you can't see them, but they help control the temperature by taking carbon from the air and moving it into the ocean. They make hard shells from a material called calcium carbonate. When they die, their shells sink and carry carbon deep into the ocean, which helps keep our planet cool. This process is called the ocean carbon pump. However, many climate models used to predict future climate do not include these plankton fully. This means scientists might not understand how the ocean will change with climate change. The study was done by a team from Spain and published in a science journal. They say we need to study these plankton better to improve climate predictions and protect our planet.",

    "Calcifying plankton are microscopic organisms in the ocean that play a big role in Earth's climate. They absorb carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, which helps reduce global warming. Climate models are tools scientists use to forecast how the climate might change in the future, but if they don't account for these tiny creatures, predictions could be inaccurate. Understanding this helps us see why protecting ocean life is important for our planet's health."
