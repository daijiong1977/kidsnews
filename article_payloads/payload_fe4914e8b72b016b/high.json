  "title": "Integrating Calcifying Plankton into Climate Models: Addressing Critical Omissions in Ocean Carbon Dynamics",
  "summary": "A comprehensive review in Science reveals significant omissions in climate models regarding calcifying plankton—coccolithophores, foraminifers, and pteropods—which are pivotal in regulating Earth's climate through the ocean carbon pump. These microorganisms synthesize calcium carbonate shells, facilitating carbon sequestration from the atmosphere to deep ocean strata, thereby modulating global temperature regimes. The study, conducted by an international team from ICTA-UAB, critiques prevailing Earth System Models (e.g., CMIP6) for neglecting key biogeochemical processes such as shallow dissolution, wherein calcium carbonate dissolves in the upper ocean due to biological mechanisms like predation and microbial respiration, altering ocean chemistry and carbon fluxes. Furthermore, it delineates species-specific climatic vulnerabilities: coccolithophores are highly susceptible to ocean acidification owing to inadequate cellular pH regulation, whereas foraminifers and pteropods confront threats from deoxygenation and thermal stress. The authors advocate for urgent empirical research to quantify calcium carbonate production, dissolution rates, and export efficiencies, asserting that such data integration will refine model predictions of ocean-atmosphere interactions, long-term carbon storage, and paleoclimate interpretations from sediment archives. This enhancement is crucial for developing robust climate projections and informing adaptive strategies for ecosystems and human societies amid escalating environmental change.",

    "Calcifying plankton are integral to marine biogeochemical cycles, with their calcium carbonate production influencing global carbon budgets and climate feedback loops. Climate models, particularly Earth System Models like CMIP6, are foundational for IPCC assessments but often parameterize biological processes simplistically, leading to uncertainties in projections. The ocean carbon pump is a critical sink for anthropogenic CO2, with processes like shallow dissolution modulating its efficiency. Understanding species-specific responses, such as coccolithophores' sensitivity to acidification, requires interdisciplinary research merging oceanography, biology, and computational science. This background equips high school students with knowledge on the complexities of climate modeling, the importance of empirical data, and the implications for policy and conservation in the context of global environmental challenges."
