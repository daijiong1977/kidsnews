  "title": "Hospitals Phase Out Desflurane to Combat Climate Change",
  "summary": "Desflurane, a common anesthetic used in surgeries worldwide, is being phased out by hospitals due to its significant environmental impact as a climate super pollutant. The European Union has recently prohibited its use in most cases, and many U.S. hospitals, led by institutions like Yale New Haven Health System, have eliminated it. Desflurane is over 7,000 times more potent than carbon dioxide in warming the planet over 20 years, contributing to greenhouse gas emissions equivalent to 1.6 million cars annually. Health care accounts for 8.5% of U.S. emissions, with anesthesia gases making up about 5% of hospital pollution. Doctors such as Jodi Sherman advocate for the switch, noting that alternatives like sevoflurane are less harmful and cheaper, saving millions of dollars. Other major providers, including Kaiser Permanente and US Anesthesia Partners, have followed, reducing emissions by up to 90%. This movement highlights how medical professionals are taking leadership in sustainability, using low-flow anesthesia techniques to minimize gas waste and demonstrating that small changes in health care can have a substantial effect on reducing global warming.",

    "Desflurane is an inhaled anesthetic introduced decades ago for use in surgical procedures due to its rapid onset and recovery times. However, research has revealed its extreme global warming potential, making it a target for reduction in health care sustainability efforts. Climate change is driven by greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide and methane, with desflurane contributing a small but significant portion from medical sources. The health care sector is a major emitter, and initiatives to curb emissions include switching to less potent anesthetics and adopting efficient practices. This shift aligns with broader environmental goals, as hospitals aim to reduce their carbon footprint while maintaining patient care standards. Understanding these changes helps middle school students grasp how industries can adapt to address global challenges like climate change."
