  "title": "Hospitals Stop Using a Gas That Hurts the Planet",
  "summary": "Hospitals around the world are stopping the use of a gas called desflurane, which is used to help patients sleep during surgery. This gas is very bad for the environment because it warms the planet much more than carbon dioxide. In Europe, it is now mostly banned, and many hospitals in the United States have also stopped using it. Doctors like Jodi Sherman at Yale University say it is an easy way to help the Earth. When hospitals use other gases instead, they can save money and reduce pollution. For example, Yale saved over a million dollars each year by switching. Other hospitals are doing the same thing, and this small change can make a big difference in fighting climate change.",

    "Desflurane is a type of anesthesia gas that doctors use during operations to make sure patients do not feel pain. It has been popular because it works quickly, but scientists found it is very harmful to the climate. Climate change is when the Earth gets warmer because of gases like carbon dioxide and desflurane in the air. Hospitals are big places that use a lot of energy and gases, so they can help reduce pollution by making smart choices. By switching to safer gases, hospitals protect the planet and save money, showing that everyone can help in small ways."
