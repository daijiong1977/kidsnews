  "title": "Hidden Shapes That Bend Electrons Like Gravity",
  "summary": "Scientists have found a hidden shape inside special materials that changes how tiny particles called electrons move. This shape is like a curve or bend, similar to how gravity makes light curve in space. The discovery was made by researchers from universities in Geneva and Italy. They studied a material made of two parts, strontium titanate and lanthanum aluminate, where electrons behave in weird ways. By using strong magnets, they saw how the electrons' paths were twisted by this hidden shape. This finding helps us understand materials better and could lead to faster electronics and new technologies in the future. It shows that many materials might have this hidden shape, not just a few.",

    "This article is about a scientific discovery in quantum materials, which are special substances that behave in strange ways at very small scales. Scientists have been studying how electrons, the tiny particles that make electricity work, move through these materials. They found a hidden geometric shape inside the materials that bends the electrons' paths, similar to how gravity bends light in space. This was observed using strong magnets on materials like strontium titanate and lanthanum aluminate. Understanding this could lead to improvements in technology, such as faster electronics and better energy use."
