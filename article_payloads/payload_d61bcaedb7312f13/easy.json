  "summary": "This article talks about how some people lose their interest in having sex as they get older. It tells the story of Alan, who used to be a dancer but later felt sad and didn't want to have sex anymore. He tried a treatment called testosterone replacement therapy, which is a hormone that can help the body. After the treatment, Alan felt happier and more interested in sex again. The article also mentions Rachel, who found the hormone helpful for her energy and mood. Many people in the UK are getting this treatment more often now. At the same time, studies show that people are having sex less frequently than before. The article asks if the hormone really helps or if it's just a big talk to make money. It's about a debate on whether this treatment works for everyone.",
