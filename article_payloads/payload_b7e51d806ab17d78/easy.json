  "title": "How Animals Live Longer When They Have Fewer Babies",
  "summary": "Animals like elephants and mice live very different lengths of time. Elephants can live up to 80 years but have only a few babies, while mice live just a few years but can have many babies. Scientists studied this and found a rule: when animals use less energy to have babies, they can live longer. They looked at 117 mammal species in zoos and found that animals who don't have babies, because of things like medicine or surgery, live about 10% longer on average. This happens because having babies takes a lot of energy from the body. For example, female baboons given medicine to stop babies lived 29% longer, and male baboons who had surgery lived 19% longer. Both males and females live longer, but for different reasons. Males live longer if they don't have certain hormones, and females live longer if they avoid the hard work of pregnancy and nursing. This helps explain why some animals age slower.",

    "Animals age at different rates, with some like elephants living many years and others like mice living only a few. This is because energy is limited, and animals must choose between using it to have babies or to keep their bodies healthy. Scientists studied mammals in zoos to see how not having babies affects lifespan. They found that reducing reproduction helps animals live longer by saving energy. This rule applies to many animals, including humans, and helps us understand aging better."
