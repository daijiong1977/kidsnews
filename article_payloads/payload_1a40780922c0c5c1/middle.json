  "title": "Francesca Jones Achieves Career Milestone with Victory Over Top-20 Opponent",
  "summary": "British tennis player Francesca Jones secured the most significant win of her career by defeating American world number 15 Emma Navarro in Auckland. Ranked 72nd, Jones had never faced an opponent inside the top 20 before, but she demonstrated her skill and mental toughness in a three-set match, winning 7-5, 2-6, 6-4. After taking an early break in the deciding set, the 25-year-old maintained composure to serve out the victory. Jones attributed her success to having the right attitude and acknowledged the challenges of preparing for the season. This performance highlights her potential to build on a successful 2025 season, during which she cracked the world's top 100. Jones has persevered despite Ectrodactyly Ectodermal Dysplasia (EEC), a rare genetic condition affecting her limbs, which led doctors to advise against a professional tennis career. Last year, she contemplated retirement but instead enjoyed her best season, making this win a testament to her resilience and determination in the sport.",
