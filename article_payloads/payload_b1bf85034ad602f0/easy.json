  "title": "Sarah Ferguson's Book is Not for Sale Anymore",
  "summary": "Sarah Ferguson, who used to be a duchess, wrote a new children's book. But the company called Nielsen said the book has been taken away from stores and is not for sale now. This book was already late in coming out before this happened. It is a story for kids, but people cannot buy it anymore. This is surprising because many were waiting to read it. The book's removal might be because of some problems, but we do not know exactly why. It is important to know that authors sometimes have to change their plans. This news helps us learn about how books are sold and what can go wrong.",
