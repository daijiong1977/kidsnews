  "title": "Celebrating 100 Years of Winnie-the-Pooh in Ashdown Forest",
  "summary": "Winnie-the-Pooh marks its 100th anniversary since first appearing in a 1925 newspaper story by AA Milne. The character, based on Milne's son Christopher Robin and his toy bear, quickly gained global fame through books like 'Winnie-the-Pooh' (1926) and 'The House at Pooh Corner' (1928), set in the fictional 100 Aker Wood, inspired by the real Ashdown Forest in East Sussex. This forest, part of the High Weald Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty, remains a tourist attraction due to Pooh's legacy, with landmarks like Pooh Sticks Bridge—a replica replacing the original sold at auction—and Pooh Corner, a gift shop and tea room. The area benefits economically, with £450,000 in public funds allocated for anniversary events. Disney's acquisition of rights in 1961 expanded Pooh's reach, making it a cultural icon. Local business owner Neil Reed notes international visitors travel to Hartfield to connect with the stories, highlighting Pooh's enduring appeal and community impact.",
