  "title": "Francesca Jones Tries Hard at Tennis Match",
  "summary": "Francesca Jones is a tennis player from Britain who played in a big tournament called the Australian Open. She got hurt during her match and had to stop playing, which made her very sad and she cried on the court. Francesca has a special condition where she has fewer fingers and toes than most people, but she still plays tennis with a different way of holding her racket. She said she will pick herself up and keep trying, even though it was tough. This was her first time in the main part of this tournament, and she wanted to win a match there for the first time. Other players like Medvedev and Swiatek also played in the tournament.",
