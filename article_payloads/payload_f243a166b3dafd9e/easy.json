  "title": "President Trump's Tariffs and the Supreme Court",
  "summary": "President Donald Trump used tariffs, which are taxes on goods from other countries, to change how the world trades. He wanted to make other countries pay more to sell things in America. But the Supreme Court, the highest court in the U.S., said he could not use emergency powers for some of these tariffs. This means some tariffs are now lower, but not all of them. Tariffs can make things more expensive, but importers have found ways to avoid high costs. The president might try other ways to keep tariffs high. This affects trade with countries like China and Europe.",
