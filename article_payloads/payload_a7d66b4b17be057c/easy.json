  "title": "A YouTuber's Scary Story: Hacked and Hurt for Making Videos",
  "summary": "Ghanem al-Masarir is a YouTuber who made funny videos criticizing the Saudi Arabian royal family from his home in London. He became very popular with millions of views, but some people did not like his videos. One day, his phones started acting strange—they were slow and the batteries died quickly. He also noticed that strangers who seemed to support Saudi Arabia were following him around London, harassing and filming him. He worried his phone was being used to spy on him, and experts later confirmed it was hacked with a tool called Pegasus. This allowed someone to see his location, turn on his camera and microphone, and steal his data. In 2018, after clicking on links in text messages, he was beaten up by two men in London who shouted at him for talking about the Saudi royal family. A court in London recently ruled that Saudi Arabia was responsible for the hacking and attack, and ordered them to pay al-Masarir over £3 million in compensation. This story shows how speaking out online can lead to serious trouble, even in a safe place like London.",
