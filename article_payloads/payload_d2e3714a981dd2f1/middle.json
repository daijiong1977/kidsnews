  "title": "Cosmetic Doctor Apologizes for Critiquing Troye Sivan's Appearance on Social Media",
  "summary": "Dr. Zayn Khalid Majeed, a cosmetic doctor based in London, posted a TikTok video analyzing pop star Troye Sivan's appearance, highlighting what he called 'problem areas' like shadows and volume loss in the face. He used the term 'twink death' to describe changes in Sivan's look, referring to a youthful aesthetic common in gay culture, and suggested cosmetic procedures such as skin boosters and dermal fillers. The video sparked backlash from fans and social media users who criticized it as unsolicited advice, leading Sivan to respond on Substack. He explained how the video triggered long-held insecurities and pushed him toward considering surgery, emphasizing his lifelong struggles with body image. Majeed, who has over 250,000 followers, deleted the video and apologized directly to Sivan, expressing regret for causing distress. He stated his intention to create more positive content moving forward. Sivan accepted the apology, updating his blog to say there were no hard feelings. This incident raises questions about the ethics of public commentary on appearance and its impact on mental health, particularly for public figures.",
