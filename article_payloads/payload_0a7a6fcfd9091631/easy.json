  "title": "BBC Faces Challenges to Stay Important",
  "summary": "A group of politicians in the UK, called MPs, have said that the BBC is having a hard time staying important for everyone. They worry that the BBC is not connecting well with young people and others who feel left out. The BBC makes money from a TV licence fee that people pay to watch TV, but many are not paying it, which means the BBC is losing over £1.1 billion. This money loss could make it harder for the BBC to make good shows and news for everyone. The MPs think the BBC needs to change to attract more young viewers who prefer other media like streaming services. In response, the BBC agrees that the licence fee system needs to be fixed, but they want to make sure the BBC can still be a public broadcaster for all. It's important for the BBC to listen to all audiences to stay trusted and relevant in the future.",

    "The BBC is a public broadcaster in the UK funded by a TV licence fee that households pay if they watch live TV. Recently, many people, especially young ones, are not paying this fee or using the BBC as much because they prefer other media like Netflix or YouTube. This has led to financial problems and concerns that the BBC might not be able to serve all audiences equally. MPs are politicians who have studied this issue and are advising the BBC to improve."
