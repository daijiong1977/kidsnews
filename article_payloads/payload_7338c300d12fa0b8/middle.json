  "title": "Enduring Love from TV's Blind Date: A 34-Year Marriage",
  "summary": "Sue and Alex Tatham's story began when Sue's friends secretly submitted her to Blind Date, a pioneering TV dating show, while Alex applied during work hours. They became the first couple from the show to marry, with their wedding broadcast to 17 million viewers in 1990, and have now been married for 34 years. Initially, neither sought love; Sue was curious about the emerging reality TV scene, and Alex compared it to modern hits like Love Island. The article traces Blind Date's origins to a 1985 pilot hosted by Cilla Black, inspired by 'The Dating Game' from America, where contestants chose dates from hidden suitors. It dominated Saturday-night TV, drawing millions, and has influenced subsequent shows such as Love is Blind and First Dates. Now, Blind Date is being revived on Disney+ for contemporary audiences, raising questions about the success of blind dates. The piece highlights the auditions, including quirky questions, and delays in their appearances, underscoring the show's impact on their lives and popular culture.",
