    "Blind Date was a popular TV show that started in 1985. It was one of the first reality TV shows where one person chose a date from three others they couldn't see. This idea came from America and became a big hit, with many people watching it on Saturday nights. Sue and Alex were part of this show and got married, showing that sometimes unexpected meetings can lead to long-lasting love. The show is important because it helped start many other dating shows we see today, and it's coming back to entertain new viewers."
