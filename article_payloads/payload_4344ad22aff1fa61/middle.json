  "title": "Revealing the Hidden Costs: Ocean Impact on Climate Economics",
  "summary": "A groundbreaking study from the University of California, San Diego's Scripps Institution of Oceanography reveals that the social cost of carbon, a key economic measure of climate damage, is nearly double previous estimates when ocean impacts are included. Published in 2026, the research calculates that global coral loss, fisheries disruption, and coastal infrastructure destruction cost nearly $2 trillion annually, raising the cost per ton of carbon dioxide from $51 to $97.20. This marks the first time ocean damages have been integrated into such assessments, highlighting a multi-trillion-dollar blind spot in climate finance. The study involved interdisciplinary collaboration among fisheries experts, coral reef researchers, biologists, and climate economists, who analyzed sectors like corals, mangroves, fisheries, and seaports. It emphasizes that island economies and low-income countries face disproportionate health and financial risks due to their reliance on seafood and ocean resources. Researchers argue that including ocean data in economic models can drive investment in adaptation, such as coral reef restoration, and address inequities where polluting nations avoid the worst consequences. The findings challenge existing policy frameworks and aim to influence international decision-making by quantifying non-use values, like cultural loss from ecosystem degradation.",

    "Climate change economics involves tools like the social cost of carbon, which helps policymakers put a price on the damages from greenhouse gas emissions. Historically, this has focused on land-based impacts, but oceans cover 70% of Earth and provide critical services like food and coastal protection. The blue economy includes industries like fishing and tourism, yet it has been overlooked in financial calculations. This article discusses a 2026 study that integrates ocean damages, revealing higher costs and highlighting global inequities. Understanding these concepts requires knowledge of interdisciplinary research, economic valuation methods, and the political challenges of climate policy, such as debates over which damages to count and how to value future harms."

  "Article_Structure": [
    "The article's main points center on a study showing that including ocean damages nearly doubles the social cost of carbon to $97.20 per ton, with annual costs reaching $2 trillion from sectors like corals and fisheries. Its purpose is to reveal a blind spot in climate finance and advocate for policy changes that address ocean impacts and global inequities. Evidence evaluation is strong, based on interdisciplinary research from Scripps Institution, but may face political contention as noted by experts. Author credibility is high, with lead researchers from reputable institutions, though potential biases toward environmental advocacy exist. Methodology involves assessing four key sectors and incorporating non-use values, using economic models to project damages, but it relies on predictions that could be uncertain."
