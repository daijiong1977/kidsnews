  "title": "The Ocean's Big Price Tag in Climate Change",
  "summary": "Scientists have found that climate change costs much more than we thought because we forgot to include the ocean. The ocean covers most of Earth and is hurt by things like coral loss and fish problems, which add nearly $2 trillion each year to the damage bill. A study from the University of California, San Diego says that when we count ocean harm, the cost of carbon pollution almost doubles from $51 to $97 per ton. This means countries need to think about the ocean when making decisions about climate. The study shows that island nations and poor countries suffer more because they rely on the ocean for food and money. Researchers hope this new information will help protect the ocean and invest in fixing coral reefs and mangroves.",

    "Climate change is when Earth's weather gets warmer and more extreme because of pollution from cars, factories, and other sources. The ocean is a huge part of our planet, home to fish, coral, and other sea life. Scientists study how pollution hurts the ocean, like by making water too warm for coral or too acidic for fish. This article talks about a new study that adds up the money lost from ocean damage, showing it's a big part of climate change costs that people used to ignore."
