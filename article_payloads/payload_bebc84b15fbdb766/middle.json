  "title": "Jesy Nelson Advocates for Social Media Ban to Safeguard Youth Mental Health",
  "summary": "Jesy Nelson, a former member of the pop group Little Mix, has experienced severe online trolling since her rise to fame on The X Factor in 2011, which she credits as a major factor in her mental health struggles. In her new documentary, Life After Little Mix, she discusses her journey into motherhood and reveals her support for banning social media platforms for individuals under 16 in the UK. Nelson argues that such a measure could protect young people from cyberbullying and allow them to enjoy childhood without digital pressures. She acknowledges the social challenges, such as potential exclusion if children lack access, but emphasizes the importance of safety. The documentary also covers her personal experiences, including her twins' medical conditions—Twin-to-Twin Transfusion Syndrome and Spinal Muscular Atrophy—highlighting her desire to document memories for her daughters. Nelson's advocacy aligns with a recent government consultation on youth well-being, reflecting broader societal concerns about social media's impact on mental health.",

    "Jesy Nelson gained fame as a member of Little Mix after appearing on The X Factor in 2011, but she has publicly discussed the negative impact of online harassment on her mental health.

The UK government is considering policies to address this, including potential age restrictions.

This context helps understand why she supports a ban on social media for under-16s, blending personal experience with broader societal debates."
