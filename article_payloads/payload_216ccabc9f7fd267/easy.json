  "title": "Minister Explains Change in Job Protection Rules",
  "summary": "The education secretary, Bridget Phillipson, has explained why the government changed its plan about unfair dismissal. Originally, they wanted workers to have protection from being unfairly fired from their first day on the job. But now, they will give this protection after six months instead of two years. This change is called a U-turn. Business groups liked the new plan because they were worried that day-one rights would make it hard to hire people. Some politicians in the Labour Party are unhappy because they promised day-one protection in their election plan. The minister says this is a practical move to get other worker benefits, like sick pay, approved faster. It helps avoid delays in Parliament and brings unions and businesses together.",

    "In the UK, workers have rights to protect them from being fired unfairly. Currently, after working for two years, they can claim unfair dismissal if their employer does not have a good reason. The government wanted to change this to give protection from the first day, but after talks with businesses and unions, they decided to make it six months instead. This helps balance worker protection with business needs."
