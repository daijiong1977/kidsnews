  "title": "Big Storm in the Southeast and Warmer Weather in the Northeast",
  "summary": "A big storm hit the Southeast over the weekend, bringing strong winds and tornado warnings to states like Mississippi, Louisiana, Georgia, and Florida. In Louisiana, the wind was so strong it flipped a horse trailer and a Mardi Gras float, broke power poles, and damaged buildings. Luckily, no one was seriously hurt. The storm caused power outages, with thousands of people losing electricity in Florida, Mississippi, and Louisiana. At the same time, the Northeast, which had been very cold for weeks, started to get warmer. Boston, for example, had been much colder than usual but is now expecting temperatures to rise closer to normal. On the West Coast, California is getting ready for another big storm with heavy rain, wind, and snow in the mountains, which could cause flooding and mudslides in some areas.",
