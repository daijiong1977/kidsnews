  "title": "Severe Weather Impacts Southeast and Northeast Thaw, with West Coast Storm Looming",
  "summary": "A weekend storm system swept across the Southeast, triggering tornado warnings in Mississippi and Louisiana before moving into Georgia and Florida. In Louisiana, near Lake Charles, high winds from a thunderstorm overturned a horse trailer and a Mardi Gras float, damaged an airport jet bridge, and tore a metal awning from a house into power lines, as documented by National Weather Service surveys. Power poles were snapped in towns like Jena and Donaldsonville, but no deaths or serious injuries were reported. The storm caused power outages, with over 12,000 customers without electricity in northern Florida, 7,000 in Mississippi, and 6,000 in Louisiana, though these were less severe than earlier ice storms. Meanwhile, the Northeast began to thaw after weeks of unusually cold weather; Boston, which had been nearly 7 degrees below average, is forecast to warm into the high 30s and low 40s, closer to seasonal norms. On the West Coast, California braced for a powerful winter storm expected to bring drenching thunderstorms, damaging winds, and heavy snow in the Sierra Nevada, with up to seven feet of snow possible. Meteorologists urged precautions, and in Los Angeles, evacuation warnings were issued for neighborhoods at risk of mud and debris flows from last year's wildfires. The article highlights regional weather contrasts and preparedness efforts.",
