  "title": "Supreme Court Limits Presidential Power in Tariff Decision",
  "summary": "In a significant ruling, the U.S. Supreme Court struck down most of President Trump's global tariffs by a 6-3 vote, dealing a major blow to his economic agenda. The court determined that President Trump lacked the authority under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act of 1977 to impose such broad tariffs. This law allows the president to take action during economic emergencies, but the court found that the tariffs did not meet the legal criteria. President Trump responded with strong criticism, labeling the justices who opposed him as unpatriotic and disloyal to the Constitution. He announced plans to circumvent the ruling by imposing a global 10% tariff under a different legal framework, highlighting ongoing tensions between the executive and judicial branches. This case underscores the checks and balances in the U.S. government, where the Supreme Court can limit presidential actions to ensure they align with statutory authority. The decision has implications for trade policy and presidential power, reflecting broader debates about executive overreach and legal interpretation.",

    "The U.S. Supreme Court plays a key role in interpreting laws and checking presidential actions. The International Emergency Economic Powers Act of 1977 was enacted to provide the president with tools during economic crises, but its use has been contested in courts. President Trump's tariff policies aimed to protect American industries and address trade imbalances, part of his 'America First' agenda. This ruling highlights ongoing legal battles over the scope of executive power, with implications for future presidents and trade relations. Understanding these dynamics helps explain how U.S. governance balances authority with legal constraints."
