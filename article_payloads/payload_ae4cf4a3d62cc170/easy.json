  "title": "The Supreme Court Says No to President Trump's Tariffs",
  "summary": "The Supreme Court, which is the highest court in the United States, made a big decision about tariffs. Tariffs are taxes on goods from other countries. President Trump wanted to put tariffs on many goods from around the world to help American businesses. But the Supreme Court said he did not have the power to do this under a law from 1977. The court voted 6-3, which means six judges said no and three said yes. This was a setback for President Trump's plans. He was upset and called the judges names, saying they were not loyal to the country. He said he would try to put a 10% tariff on all goods using a different law. This story shows how the Supreme Court can check the president's actions to make sure they follow the rules.",

    "The Supreme Court is part of the U.S. government and helps decide if laws are fair. Tariffs are used to make foreign goods more expensive so people buy American products instead. President Trump was trying to use his power as president to put tariffs on goods from many countries, but the Supreme Court said he needed to follow specific rules. This shows how different parts of the government work together to make decisions."
