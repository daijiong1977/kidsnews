  "title": "BP Divests Majority Stake in Castrol to Refocus on Core Business",
  "summary": "BP has agreed to sell a 65% stake in its Castrol motor oil division to Stonepeak, a US investment firm, for $6 billion, valuing Castrol at $10.1 billion. BP will retain a 35% stake in Castrol, which it acquired in 2000. The cash proceeds will be used to reduce debt and allow BP to concentrate on its core crude oil and gas operations. This sale is a key step in BP's broader strategy to divest $20 billion in assets, announced in February, with the company now over halfway to that target. BP is shifting its strategy away from green energy investments due to pressure from investors who were dissatisfied with its financial performance compared to rivals like Shell and Equinor. The deal follows recent leadership changes, including the appointment of Meg O'Neill as BP's first female CEO, set to take over in 2026. Interim CEO Carol Howle described the sale as beneficial for stakeholders, emphasizing reduced complexity and a focus on integrated businesses. This move is part of a series of asset sales, including offloading US wind energy and Dutch mobility units, as BP aims to streamline its operations and strengthen its balance sheet.",

    "BP is a global energy company headquartered in London, with a history dating back to the early 20th century. Castrol, acquired by BP in 2000, is a leading brand in lubricants for automotive and industrial use. In recent years, BP has faced challenges from fluctuating oil prices and investor demands for higher returns, leading to a strategic pivot. The company announced a plan to sell $20 billion in assets to reduce debt and refocus on its core oil and gas business, moving away from earlier commitments to green energy. This reflects broader trends in the energy sector, where firms like Shell and Equinor are also scaling back renewable investments. Leadership changes, including the appointment of Meg O'Neill as CEO, signal BP's ongoing transformation. Understanding these dynamics helps explain why the Castrol sale is a significant milestone in BP's corporate restructuring."
