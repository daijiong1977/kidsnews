  "title": "BP Sells Part of Castrol for $6 Billion",
  "summary": "BP, a big oil company, sold a 65% stake in Castrol, its motor oil division, for $6 billion to Stonepeak, an investment firm from the US. Castrol makes lubricants for cars and other vehicles. BP will keep 35% of Castrol. The money from the sale will help BP pay off debts and focus on its main oil and gas business. BP is selling many assets to reach a $20 billion goal, and this deal helps them get halfway there. They are also changing their strategy to invest more in oil and gas instead of green energy. This sale happened after BP announced its first female CEO, Meg O'Neill, who will start in 2026. The deal is part of BP's plan to simplify its business and improve its finances.",
