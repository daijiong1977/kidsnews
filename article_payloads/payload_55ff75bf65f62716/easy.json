  "title": "What Mormons Think About a TV Show",
  "summary": "This article talks about a TV show called The Secret Lives of Mormon Wives. It is a reality show that follows women in Utah who are part of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, also called Mormons. The show has themes like infidelity and divorce, which are not usually linked to Christianity. It is very popular on streaming services like Hulu and Disney+. The BBC asked Mormons in the UK what they think about the show. Some Mormons, like Ben and Olivia, watch and enjoy it. Ben says Mormons are normal people, and while bad things can happen, they try to avoid them. He feels the show does not embarrass them. The article also explains that Mormons believe in the Book of Mormon and send missionaries around the world. In the UK, there are about 185,000 Mormons, and they have a big temple in Preston.",
