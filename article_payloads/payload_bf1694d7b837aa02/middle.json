  "title": "Late Diagnosis of Spinal Muscular Atrophy in Newborns",
  "summary": "This article discusses the issue of delayed diagnosis for babies with Spinal Muscular Atrophy (SMA), a rare and progressive muscle-wasting disease that can be fatal if untreated. Parents report that their children, such as Dani-Rae Brown and Lucian Neale, were diagnosed months after symptoms appeared, leading to severe disabilities like wheelchair dependence. Dani-Rae's father highlights that she showed symptoms at five months but was not diagnosed until twelve months, blaming the NHS for the delay. Currently, the NHS only screens newborns for SMA if they have a sibling with the condition, as part of a blood spot test for nine rare diseases. SMA UK, a charity, advocates for universal newborn screening to enable early treatment, which could prevent muscle deterioration and allow normal development. The Welsh government states it follows UK National Screening Committee advice, which does not recommend routine SMA screening, but is open to future recommendations. The article emphasizes the personal impact on families and calls for policy changes to improve early detection.",

    "Spinal Muscular Atrophy (SMA) is a genetic disorder caused by a lack of survival motor neuron protein, leading to progressive muscle weakness and often death in infancy if untreated. It is rare, affecting about 1 in 10,000 births. In the UK, healthcare is provided by the NHS, which includes newborn screening programs. Currently, SMA is not part of routine screening, unlike conditions like cystic fibrosis, due to recommendations from the UK National Screening Committee. Early intervention with treatments like gene therapy can significantly improve outcomes, making timely diagnosis critical. This article highlights the gap between medical advancements and screening policies, urging for updates to prevent disabilities."

  "Article_Structure": [
    "This article analyzes the delayed diagnosis of Spinal Muscular Atrophy (SMA) in newborns. Main Points include personal stories from parents about late diagnoses leading to severe disabilities, and advocacy by SMA UK for universal screening. Purpose is to raise awareness and push for policy changes to enable early treatment. Evidence Evaluation shows reliance on anecdotal accounts from parents and statements from officials, which are credible but lack statistical data. Author Credibility is implied through BBC News reporting, known for factual journalism, though specific author expertise is not stated. Methodology involves interviewing affected families and referencing official responses, providing a balanced view but limited to UK context."
