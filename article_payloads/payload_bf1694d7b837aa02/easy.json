  "title": "Babies with a Rare Disease Get Late Help",
  "summary": "This article talks about babies born with a rare disease called Spinal Muscular Atrophy (SMA). SMA makes muscles weak and can be very serious. Parents say their babies were diagnosed too late, after they showed symptoms like not moving their legs. For example, Dani-Rae Brown was diagnosed at 12 months old, but she had symptoms at 5 months. Now, she uses a wheelchair and cannot move much. The NHS does not test all newborns for SMA, only if a sibling has it. A charity wants the NHS to test all babies so they can get treatment early. Early treatment might help babies walk and play like other kids. The Welsh government says they follow advice and will think about adding SMA to tests.",

    "Spinal Muscular Atrophy (SMA) is a rare disease that affects babies and makes their muscles weak over time. It can be very serious if not treated early. In the UK, the NHS helps people with health problems, but they do not test all babies for SMA. Parents are worried because late diagnosis means babies might not get help in time to prevent problems like not being able to walk. This article shares stories from parents to show why early testing is important."
