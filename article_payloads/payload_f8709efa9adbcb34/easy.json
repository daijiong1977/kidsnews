  "title": "Kemi Badenoch Wants to Use People's Anger Against the Other Party",
  "summary": "Kemi Badenoch is a leader in the Conservative Party in the UK. She says many people are angry about how the country is being run. She wants to use this anger to help her party win against the Labour Party, which is in charge now. She thinks the Conservatives are the only ones who can make hard choices to fix problems. She also criticizes another party called Reform UK for wanting too much control over businesses. Badenoch believes that after seeing Labour in power for 18 months, people understand what they are doing, so it is easier for the Conservatives to oppose them. She says her party has learned from losing an election in 2024 and is now ready to be brave and competent.",
