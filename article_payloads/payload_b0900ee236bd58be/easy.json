  "title": "Judge Helps Senator in Trouble",
  "summary": "A judge stopped the Pentagon from punishing Senator Mark Kelly. Senator Kelly is from Arizona and was in a video that told soldiers to say no to bad orders. The Pentagon wanted to lower his pay and rank because of this. The judge said this was wrong and protected Kelly's rights. Kelly is happy and said he will keep standing up to the government. The Pentagon plans to appeal, which means they will ask another court to change the decision. This happened after a grand jury, a group that looks at cases, did not charge Kelly and others for the video. In other news, Democrats are upset about the El Paso airport closing, and farmers in India are on strike against a trade deal with the U.S.",

    "This story is about how the U.S. government works. Senators like Mark Kelly help make laws, and the Pentagon is part of the military. Sometimes, people disagree about what is right, and judges step in to decide. In this case, the judge protected Kelly's rights when the Pentagon wanted to punish him for speaking out in a video. This shows that in America, people can stand up for their beliefs, even if it causes arguments. Other news includes problems with airport coordination and protests in other countries, which are common in global events."
