  "title": "Bet365 CEO's Pay Soars to £280 Million Amid Profit Drop",
  "summary": "Denise Coates, the founder and CEO of Bet365, received a pay package of at least £280 million in 2025, a significant increase from £158 million the previous year. This makes her one of Britain's highest-paid executives. Her earnings included a £104 million salary and a share of £354 million in dividends, as she is the majority shareholder. Over the past decade, she has earned over £2 billion from the company. However, Bet365's pre-tax profit fell to £349 million from £627 million, even though revenue rose by 9% to £4 billion. Campaign groups like the High Pay Centre criticize her pay as excessive, arguing that it comes from an industry linked to harm. Bet365, started in a portable building in Stoke-on-Trent, is now a major global online gambling firm and the largest private employer in the city. Coates, one of Britain's richest women, is also a big taxpayer, with her salary contributing tens of millions in taxes.",

    "Denise Coates is the founder and CEO of Bet365, a leading online gambling company based in Stoke-on-Trent, UK. She started the business over 20 years ago from a small portable building, leveraging her background as an accountant and her family's bookmaking business. Bet365 has grown into a global firm offering sports betting, poker, casino games, and bingo, employing many people in Stoke-on-Trent. The company's revenue has increased, but profits have fluctuated, leading to debates about executive pay. Campaign groups argue that high pay in the gambling industry is problematic due to potential social harms, while supporters highlight job creation and tax contributions. Coates is among Britain's richest women and top taxpayers, reflecting the complex dynamics of wealth and responsibility in business."
