  "title": "Tracey Emin's Artwork: A Bed That Tells a Story",
  "summary": "Tracey Emin is a famous artist who made a special artwork called My Bed in 1998. It showed her messy bedroom with things like dirty sheets, empty bottles, and cigarettes. People were surprised because it looked very real and personal. The artwork was nominated for a big prize called the Turner Prize and sold for over £2.5 million. Now, Tracey says if she made My Bed today, it would be tidy, clean, and boring, with nice sheets and her cats nearby. She explains that the messy bed was from a sad time in her life, but it helped her feel better. The artwork is now on display at a museum in London, and it makes people think about what art can be.",
