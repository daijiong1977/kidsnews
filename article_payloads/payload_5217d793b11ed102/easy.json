  "title": "A Space Mystery: Why Uranus Had So Much Energy When Voyager 2 Visited",
  "summary": "A long time ago, in 1986, a spacecraft called Voyager 2 flew past the planet Uranus. Scientists were surprised because it found a lot of high-energy radiation around Uranus, more than they expected. For almost 40 years, they didn't know why. Now, new research from the Southwest Research Institute might have an answer. They think that space weather, like solar wind events from the Sun, was happening at Uranus during the flyby. This space weather could have made the radiation belts supercharged with extra energy. The scientists compared data from Voyager 2 with what we know about Earth's space weather. This helps explain the mystery, but there are still more secrets about Uranus to discover, and scientists want to send another mission to learn more.",

    "Uranus is the seventh planet from the Sun and is made mostly of ice and gas. It has rings and moons, and it spins on its side. Spacecraft like Voyager 2 help us learn about planets by taking pictures and measurements. Space weather includes things like solar flares and solar wind, which can affect planets by creating auroras or changing radiation levels. Scientists study space to understand how our solar system works and to keep astronauts safe."
