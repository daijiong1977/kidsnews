  "title": "The Life and Controversies of Scott Adams, Dilbert Creator",
  "summary": "Scott Adams, the American cartoonist behind the Dilbert comic strip, died at 68 from prostate cancer that had spread to his bones. His ex-wife Shelly Miles announced his passing during a live stream of his podcast, Real Coffee with Scott Adams. Dilbert, launched in 1989, satirized office culture through the character of a frustrated engineer and reached over 2,000 newspapers in 65 countries, expanding into books, an animated series, and a video game. However, in 2023, major publications like the Washington Post cancelled the strip after Adams made racist remarks, calling black Americans a 'hate group' and advising white people to avoid them, based on a poll. He defended his comments as hyperbole and disavowed racism, but the controversy damaged his reputation. Former President Donald Trump praised Adams on Truth Social, highlighting their friendship. Adams also authored self-help books and was a trained hypnotist. In a posthumous message, he expressed gratitude for his life and urged others to 'pay it forward' by being useful. His cancer diagnosis was revealed in May 2025, and by January, he acknowledged recovery was unlikely.",

His career spanned decades, but it was marred by controversy in 2023 when he made statements perceived as racist against black Americans, leading to the cancellation of his strip by several newspapers. Adams argued he was exaggerating to highlight issues, but the incident sparked debate about free speech and racism. Beyond cartoons, he ventured into self-help literature and hypnosis, aiming to inspire personal growth. His death from cancer highlights the challenges of health battles, and his legacy is mixed, blending creative success with public scrutiny."
