  "title": "Hybrid-Phase Metasurface for Independent Achromatic Control of Dual-Spin States",
  "summary": "In a pioneering study published in PhotoniX, researchers from Nanjing University have developed a hybrid-phase cooperative dispersion-engineering metasurface that achieves independent achromatic control for two distinct spin states, addressing critical limitations in broadband optical technologies. Dispersion-induced chromatic aberrations pose significant challenges for full-color imaging and multi-spectral sensing, as they compromise phase and group delay accuracy. Conventional metasurfaces, while effective for light manipulation, often restrict achromatic performance to a single spin channel or enforce shared dispersion between spins, hindering fully independent control. The novel approach integrates Aharonov-Anandan (AA) and Pancharatnam-Berry (PB) geometric phases within a single-layer design: the AA phase facilitates spin unlocking by creating asymmetric current distributions in meta-atoms, thereby separating right- and left-handed circularly polarized (RCP and LCP) waves, while the PB phase extends the phase range to 2π without altering group delay. Through meticulous tuning of meta-atom resonant strengths, frequency adjustments, and local structural rotations, the team independently optimized phase and group delay for each spin, minimizing inter-channel crosstalk. Experimental validation across the 8-12 GHz microwave and 0.8-1.2 THz terahertz regimes demonstrated spin-unlocked achromatic beam deflectors and metalenses that maintain high performance over broad bandwidths. This framework not only advances dual-spin meta-optics but also offers a scalable methodology for dispersion engineering across the electromagnetic spectrum, with potential extensions into visible light for applications in polarization-multiplexed imaging and integrated photonics, supported by inverse-design optimization techniques.",

    "Advanced optical technologies, such as full-color imaging and multi-spectral sensing, require precise control of light across broad bandwidths, but dispersion effects often lead to chromatic aberrations that degrade performance. Metasurfaces, engineered with subwavelength meta-atoms, offer a promising platform for light manipulation, yet achieving independent achromatic control for dual spin states has been a persistent hurdle due to intertwined phase and group delay properties. This research builds on geometric phase concepts, including Aharonov-Anandan and Pancharatnam-Berry phases, to develop a hybrid-phase framework that decouples spin channels. By integrating experimental validation across microwave and terahertz frequencies, the study provides a foundational approach for dispersion engineering, with implications for extending into visible light applications and leveraging computational optimization for real-world deployment in integrated photonics and imaging systems."
