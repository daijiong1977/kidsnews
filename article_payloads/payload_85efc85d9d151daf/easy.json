  "title": "A Cool New Surface That Controls Light in Two Ways",
  "summary": "Scientists have made a special flat surface that can control light in two different ways at the same time. Light can spin in two directions, like a top spinning left or right. Usually, when light of different colors passes through materials, it gets mixed up, causing problems like blurry images. This new surface, called a metasurface, is made of tiny structures that are smaller than a grain of sand. It uses two special tricks: one trick helps separate the light spins, and the other trick helps control the light's path without mixing them up. This allows the surface to steer or focus light for both spins independently, which is useful for making better cameras and sensors. The scientists tested it with microwaves and terahertz waves, showing it works in different parts of the light spectrum. This invention could lead to smaller and smarter optical devices in the future.",

    "Light is all around us and helps us see things. Sometimes, when light passes through lenses or materials, different colors can get mixed up, making images look blurry. Scientists are always trying to find new ways to control light better, like in cameras or glasses. This article talks about a new invention that uses tiny structures on a flat surface to handle light in two different spinning directions without mixing them up, which could make optical devices work better and be smaller."
