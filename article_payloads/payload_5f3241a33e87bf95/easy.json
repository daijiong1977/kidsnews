    "Police are supposed to help people when they report crimes. Sometimes, they use community resolutions to solve problems without going to court. In this story, a teenager named Theo told the police he was attacked at school, but the police gave him a community resolution instead of helping him. This made Theo confused and scared. An investigation later found that the police made a mistake and apologized. This shows that police need to be careful and clear when talking to young people to avoid misunderstandings."
