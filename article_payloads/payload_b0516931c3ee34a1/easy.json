  "title": "UK Prices Go Up a Little After Five Months",
  "summary": "In the UK, prices for things people buy went up a bit in December after going down for five months. This is called inflation, and it rose to 3.4%. The main reasons were higher prices for tobacco and airplane tickets during Christmas. Experts say this is not a big worry because these are one-time things that won't keep happening. The Bank of England, which controls interest rates, will meet soon to decide what to do. They might lower borrowing costs slowly this year to help people. The government is trying to cut living costs by freezing rail fares and prescription charges. Some people blame the government for the price rise, but others think it's just temporary. Overall, this small increase is expected to be short-lived.",

    "Inflation is a measure of how much prices for everyday items like food, clothes, and travel increase over time. In the UK, the government tracks this to understand the economy. When inflation rises, it means things cost more, which can make it harder for families to afford what they need. The Bank of England tries to control inflation by adjusting interest rates, which affect how much it costs to borrow money for things like homes or cars. Sometimes, temporary events like holidays can cause short-term price spikes, but experts watch to see if these changes last."
