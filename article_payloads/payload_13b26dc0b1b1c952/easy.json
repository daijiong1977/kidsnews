  "title": "SpaceX Tests a Big Rocket Booster for a New Starship Flight",
  "summary": "SpaceX has finished testing a big rocket booster called Super Heavy V3. This booster will help launch the next Starship flight. The test was done in Texas over four days. Workers put very cold liquid nitrogen into the booster to check if it is strong and ready. This is important because the last booster broke during a test. The new booster passed the test and will get 33 engines and three grid fins added. Grid fins help control the rocket when it comes back to Earth. After more tests, SpaceX plans to launch the Starship V3 before March ends. This rocket could one day go to the Moon and Mars. NASA is watching because they want to use Starship for Moon missions.",

    "SpaceX is a company that builds rockets and spaceships. They are testing a new booster for their Starship rocket, which is designed to carry people and cargo to space. Testing helps make sure rockets are safe and strong before launch. NASA works with SpaceX to plan trips to the Moon. Rockets have boosters that push them up and parts like grid fins to help them land back on Earth."
