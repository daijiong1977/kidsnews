  "summary": "This article is about people who hunt for wild mushrooms in Pennsylvania and nearby areas. Researchers studied what kinds of mushrooms they find and why they collect them. They found 160 different types! People pick mushrooms to eat, make medicine, create art like photos and dyes, and learn about science. The most popular mushrooms are morels, chicken of the woods, and chanterelles. Many foragers share their finds with friends and family, and they use the internet, family, and books to learn. The study helps us understand how people enjoy nature and use mushrooms in many ways.",

    "Mushrooms are fungi that grow in forests and fields. People have been picking wild mushrooms for a long time to eat, make medicine, or create art. In this study, researchers in Pennsylvania asked over 800 mushroom hunters about what they do. They found that foragers collect many types of mushrooms and share them with others. This helps us learn how people connect with nature and use natural resources safely."
