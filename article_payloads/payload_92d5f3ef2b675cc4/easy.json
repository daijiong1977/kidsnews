  "title": "How Weight Loss Medicines Help Families Spend Less on Food",
  "summary": "A new study shows that medicines like Ozempic and Wegovy, which help people lose weight by making them less hungry, are also helping families in America spend less money on food. Researchers from Cornell University looked at what thousands of households buy and found that after starting these medicines, people spend less on groceries and eating out. For example, grocery spending went down by about 5% in six months, and spending at fast-food places dropped by 8%. The biggest cuts were on snacks like chips and cookies. This happens because the medicines reduce cravings for unhealthy foods. The study used real shopping data to see these changes, making it more reliable. If more people use these medicines, it could change how food companies and restaurants sell their products.",
