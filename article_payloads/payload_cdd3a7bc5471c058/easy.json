  "title": "David Walliams Dropped from Book Festival",
  "summary": "David Walliams is a famous author who writes books for kids. He was supposed to go to a book festival next year, but he has been dropped from it. This happened because some people said he acted inappropriately towards young women. The festival is run by Waterstones, a big book store. Walliams says he did not do anything wrong and is getting legal help. Other authors like Cressida Cowell and Liz Pichon will still go to the festival. Walliams has sold many books, like Gangsta Granny, and some have been made into TV shows. His publisher, HarperCollins, also stopped working with him recently. The festival will happen in three places: Dundee, Lincoln, and Taunton.",
