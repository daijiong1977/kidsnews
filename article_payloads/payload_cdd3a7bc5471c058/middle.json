  "title": "David Walliams Removed from Children's Book Festival Amid Allegations",
  "summary": "David Walliams, a prominent British author and comedian known for his children's books, has been removed from the Waterstones Children's Book Festival scheduled for next year. This decision follows allegations of inappropriate behaviour towards young women, which Walliams strongly denies. His publisher, HarperCollins, recently severed ties with him, adding to the controversy. The festival, organized by the Waterstones book chain, will take place in three locations: Dundee, Lincoln, and Taunton. Walliams has been taken off the speakers list, with other authors like Cressida Cowell and Liz Pichon still set to appear. Walliams is a highly successful author, having sold over 60 million books worldwide, with titles such as Gangsta Granny and The Boy in the Dress adapted into TV films. He is seeking legal advice to contest the allegations, claiming he was not informed or given a chance to respond. The BBC has stated it has no future projects with him, though his scheduled TV appearance on Boxing Day remains unchanged. This situation highlights issues of accountability and reputation in the publishing industry.",
