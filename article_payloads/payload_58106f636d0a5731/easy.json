  "title": "A School in a Tough Town",
  "summary": "In a small town by the sea, a school has problems because nearby houses smell bad, so kids can't play outside. The town used to have many jobs in mines, but after the mines closed, things got hard. People lost work, and many moved away. Now, some families are poor, and the town feels forgotten. Recently, people voted for a new political group called Reform UK, hoping for change. The school tries to help children by giving them special jobs, like helping in the library, but they have to apply and might not get picked. This teaches them skills for the future. The town has empty houses and landlords who don't live there, making it tough for everyone. People wish for better times and feel left behind by promises from leaders.",

    "This story is about a coastal town in England that has faced many challenges. Long ago, it was busy with mining jobs, but when the mines closed, jobs disappeared, and life became difficult. Many people left, and those who stayed often struggle with poverty. The town has empty houses and problems with landlords who don't care. Schools work hard to help children learn skills for the future, even when things are tough. Recently, people voted for a new political group, hoping it will make things better, but change is slow. This shows how some communities feel forgotten by leaders and are trying to find new ways to improve their lives."
