  "title": "President Trump's Plan for Greenland",
  "summary": "President Donald Trump has said he has a plan for a future deal about Greenland, which is a big island that belongs to Denmark. He announced this after talking with NATO leaders in Switzerland. Denmark and Greenland say they will not give up control of Greenland. They want to talk about other things like safety and money, but not about who owns Greenland. Other countries like the UK hope everyone can talk together to protect Greenland's independence. This is a big story because it involves many countries and their rules.",

    "Greenland is the world's largest island and is part of Denmark, but it has its own government. The United States is a big country that sometimes wants to make deals with other places. Sovereignty means who gets to make decisions for a place. NATO is an organization where countries work together to keep peace. This story is about leaders talking and trying to agree on what to do with Greenland."
