  "title": "Trump's Framework for Greenland: Sovereignty and International Talks",
  "summary": "US President Donald Trump announced a framework for a future deal regarding Greenland, following discussions at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. This announcement came amid tensions, including threats of sanctions against allies opposing US plans. Trump stated the deal would benefit the US and NATO, but details remain unspecified. Denmark and Greenland have firmly rejected any negotiation over sovereignty, emphasizing that Greenland's control is non-negotiable. Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen expressed willingness to discuss political, security, and economic issues, but not sovereignty. NATO spokeswoman Allison Hart indicated negotiations aim to prevent Russian and Chinese influence in Greenland. However, Greenlandic lawmakers insist on inclusion in talks, asserting 'nothing about us without us.' The UK supports direct discussions to protect Greenland's sovereignty, highlighting international concerns over this territorial issue.",
