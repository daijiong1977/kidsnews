  "title": "White Rocks on Mars Show It Had Rain Long Ago",
  "summary": "Scientists found white rocks on Mars that tell us the planet might have had lots of rain millions of years ago. These rocks are called kaolinite clay, which on Earth forms when water washes away other minerals over a long time. NASA's Perseverance rover saw these rocks in Jezero crater, where there was once a big lake. The rocks are small and scattered, and they help us learn that Mars was once warmer and wetter, like some tropical places on Earth. This discovery helps scientists understand how Mars changed from a wet world to the dry, cold planet we see today.",

    "Mars is a planet in our solar system that is cold and dry now, but scientists think it might have had water long ago. Rovers like Perseverance are sent to explore Mars and collect rocks to learn about its history. Kaolinite is a type of clay that needs lots of water to form, so finding it on Mars suggests there was once rain or lakes there. This helps us imagine what Mars was like billions of years ago and how planets can change over time."
