  "title": "Mars' White Rocks Reveal Clues to Ancient Rainfall and Climate Change",
  "summary": "Recent research led by scientists at Purdue University, using data from NASA's Perseverance rover, has identified white kaolinite clay rocks on Mars, indicating that the planet may have experienced millions of years of rainfall in its past. These rocks, found scattered in Jezero crater—a site believed to have once contained a large lake—stand out against Mars' red surface and suggest humid, tropical-like conditions. Kaolinite forms on Earth through prolonged water exposure, requiring warm, wet climates with persistent rainfall over geological timescales. The study, published in Communications Earth & Environment, involved analyzing the rocks with instruments like SuperCam and Mastcam-Z, comparing them to Earth samples. While the exact origin of these rocks remains unclear, possibly washed in by a river or scattered by an impact, they provide critical evidence for Mars' transition from a wetter world to its current arid state. This discovery contributes to debates about Mars' ancient climate and highlights the importance of rover missions in uncovering planetary history.",

    "Mars, often called the Red Planet, has a thin atmosphere and is currently cold and dry, but evidence suggests it had liquid water billions of years ago. NASA's Perseverance rover, part of the Mars 2020 mission, landed in Jezero crater in 2021 to study rocks and search for signs of past habitability. Kaolinite is a clay mineral that on Earth forms in tropical regions with heavy rainfall, indicating wet conditions. Scientists use rovers equipped with cameras and spectrometers to analyze Martian geology, helping reconstruct the planet's climate history. This research ties into broader questions about planetary evolution and the potential for life beyond Earth."
