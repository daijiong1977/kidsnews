  "title": "Kids Feel Better When Schools Open After COVID",
  "summary": "A new study found that children felt happier and less worried when their schools reopened after the COVID-19 pandemic. The research looked at kids aged 5 to 18 in California and showed that after schools opened, fewer children were diagnosed with problems like anxiety, depression, and ADHD. Girls improved more than boys. The study suggests that going back to school helps kids by giving them friends to play with, a routine, and support from teachers. It also saved money on health care because fewer kids needed treatment. This information can help parents and leaders make better decisions to keep kids healthy during future emergencies.",

    "During the COVID-19 pandemic, many schools closed to keep people safe from the virus. Kids had to stay home and learn online, which made some feel lonely, worried, or sad because they missed their friends and teachers. This study looked at what happened when schools opened again, showing that being back in school helped kids feel better mentally and reduced health problems like anxiety and depression. It's important because it tells us that schools are not just for learning but also for supporting kids' emotions and well-being."
