    "BTS, formed in 2013, is a South Korean boy band under Big Hit Entertainment, known for addressing social issues through music. They gained global fame with hits like 'Dynamite' and 'Butter', breaking records in the music industry. Mandatory military service in South Korea requires men aged 18-28 to serve about 18-22 months, impacting K-pop careers. The band's hiatus allowed members to fulfill this duty while maintaining fan engagement through solo projects and online content. The K-pop industry relies heavily on fan culture and strategic marketing to sustain interest during breaks. Wembley Stadium is an iconic venue that symbolizes international success for artists. The Covid-19 pandemic disrupted live events worldwide, leading to increased demand for post-pandemic concerts. This context helps explain BTS's planned comeback and the heightened anticipation among fans."
