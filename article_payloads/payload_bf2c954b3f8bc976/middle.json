  "summary": "Nicki Minaj, a prominent rapper, made an unexpected appearance at the Turning Point USA AmericaFest convention in Arizona, a conservative gathering honoring the late activist Charlie Kirk. During an interview with Erika Kirk, Charlie Kirk's widow and new leader of the organization, Minaj expressed her newfound support for former President Donald Trump and Vice President JD Vance, whom she praised as role models for young men. This marked a shift from her past criticisms of Trump. Minaj also mocked California Governor Gavin Newsom using a derogatory nickname and emphasized the importance of speaking one's mind, stating she was tired of being pushed around. She argued that controversy arises because people are not using their minds sufficiently. Erika Kirk commended Minaj for her courage in facing backlash from the entertainment industry for her political stance. Minaj dismissed critics, saying they were too busy building and considered themselves the cool kids. The article highlights Minaj's background as a Trinidadian-born artist with hit songs and Grammy nominations, underscoring her influence in pop culture and her entry into political discourse.",
