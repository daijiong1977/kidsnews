  "title": "Why the UK Leader Is Quiet About a US Action",
  "summary": "The UK leader, Sir Keir Starmer, is not saying much about a recent event where the US took the Venezuelan president from his country. This is because Sir Keir wants to keep a good relationship with the US, especially since Donald Trump is back as president. He thinks that if he criticizes Trump publicly, it could cause fights and hurt the UK. For example, the UK got a deal with the US to save jobs at a car company, and Sir Keir believes being careful helps the UK. Some people in other parties are upset that he is not speaking out, but Sir Keir sticks to his plan to avoid problems.",
