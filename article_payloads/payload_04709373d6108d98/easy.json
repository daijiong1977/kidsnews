  "title": "A Street in Danger: Homes Might Be Torn Down Due to Flooding",
  "summary": "In a small town called Ynysybwl, there is a street named Clydach Terrace where people are very scared because it floods often. The water comes from a nearby stream called Nant Clydach. Big storms like Dennis and Bert have caused the street to go underwater, damaging many houses. The people living there, like Paige who works for the ambulance service, feel anxious and worried, especially when they have to leave their pets or children at home during flood warnings. The local council is thinking about buying 16 homes on this street to help the families move to safer places. They say this is because climate change is making floods happen more often. Building a big wall to stop the flooding is too expensive, so buying the homes might be the best solution. Some houses are not included because they are higher up and safer. This plan could give the residents a fresh start away from the danger of floods.",

    "Flooding happens when water from rain or rivers covers land, which can damage homes and make people feel unsafe. In some places, climate change is causing more floods because the weather is changing. Local councils sometimes help by moving families to safer areas if it's too hard to protect their homes. This article talks about one street where this might happen, showing how communities deal with natural dangers."
