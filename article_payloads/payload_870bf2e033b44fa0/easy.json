  "title": "A Fight Over a Famous Building's Name",
  "summary": "A lawmaker named Joyce Beatty is suing to stop a name change at a big arts center in Washington, D.C. The center was originally named after President John F. Kennedy, but recently, its board voted to add President Donald Trump's name to it, making it the Trump-Kennedy Center. Beatty says this change is against the law because only Congress can approve such a renaming. She tried to speak against it in a meeting but was muted. The White House defends the change, saying Trump helped the center by improving its money and building. Some people are upset, like a musician who canceled his yearly Christmas concert there because of the new name. The center has been a famous place since it was built to honor Kennedy.",

    "The John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts is a big building in Washington, D.C., where people go to see shows like music and plays. It was built to honor President Kennedy after he died. Congress made it a special place to remember him. Sometimes, groups like boards make decisions about such places, but laws can say who has the power to change things like names. This article is about a disagreement over who should decide the name of this important center."
