  "title": "Tottenham Fires Coach After Losing Games",
  "summary": "Tottenham Hotspur, a soccer team in London, has fired their coach Thomas Frank. He was in charge for eight months. The team lost a game to Newcastle at home, and they are not winning many matches this season. Tottenham is near the bottom of the league table, which is bad because they could get relegated. The team said they wanted to give Frank more time, but the poor results made them change their mind. Frank helped the team do well in European games, but in the Premier League, they struggled. Tottenham thanked Frank for his hard work and wished him good luck. Now, they need to find a new coach to help the team win more games.",
