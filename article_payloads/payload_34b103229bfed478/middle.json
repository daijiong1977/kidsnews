  "title": "Tottenham Dismisses Coach Amid Poor Season Performance",
  "summary": "Tottenham Hotspur has sacked head coach Thomas Frank after less than eight months in charge, following a 2-1 home defeat to Newcastle. The club is currently 16th in the Premier League, just five points above the relegation zone, after a dismal run of form that includes being winless in their last eight league games—their longest such streak since 2008. Over the past 17 matches, Tottenham has won only two, accumulating just 12 points. Despite initial intentions to support Frank for long-term development, recent results forced the club to make a change. Frank, who took over in June after Ange Postecoglou's dismissal and signed a contract until 2028, failed to significantly improve league performance, though he led the team to automatic qualification for the Champions League last 16 by finishing fourth in their group. However, domestic cup exits to Newcastle and Aston Villa added to the struggles. Tottenham acknowledged Frank's commitment and contribution, thanking him and wishing him future success, as they now seek a new coach to reverse their fortunes.",
