  "title": "EasyJet's Bag Fee Problem",
  "summary": "EasyJet, an airline, was told by the Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) to stop saying that carry-on bag fees start at £5.99. The ASA is a group that checks if ads are fair. They said this claim was misleading because EasyJet could not show that passengers could actually get a bag for that low price. EasyJet argued that £5.99 was the starting price on some routes, but the ASA did not agree. Now, EasyJet has changed its website to say that fees vary and customers will see the exact price when they book. This helps people know what they are paying for and avoid surprises.",
