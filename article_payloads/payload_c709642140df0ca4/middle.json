  "title": "Understanding Measles: Prevention and Symptoms for Families",
  "summary": "Measles, a highly contagious respiratory virus eliminated from the U.S. in 2000, is resurging, with over 2,000 cases reported in 2025 and hundreds already this year, primarily from outbreaks in South Carolina and other states. This poses a risk, especially for young children who are more vulnerable. The article serves as a guide for parents, explaining that measles causes a distinctive rash along with symptoms like cough, runny nose, fever, and red eyes, which typically appear one to two weeks after exposure. Doctors note that even mild cases are miserable and stress the importance of vaccination, which previously made infections rare. The virus spreads easily, and with some healthcare professionals encountering it for the first time, public awareness is crucial. Symptoms progress from initial flu-like signs to Koplik spots in the mouth and then a rash that starts on the face and spreads. In the context of rising cases, the article aims to inform families about prevention strategies and what to look for to protect their health.",
