  "title": "Keeping Kids Safe from Measles: A Simple Guide for Parents",
  "summary": "Measles is a sickness that was gone from the United States but is coming back. It can make kids very sick with a rash, cough, fever, and red eyes. Parents need to know how to protect their children because measles spreads easily. Doctors say it's not a mild illness and can be miserable even if kids don't go to the hospital. Symptoms start one to two weeks after someone gets exposed, beginning with common signs like a cough and runny nose, then a rash appears on the face and spreads. There are special spots in the mouth too. To prevent measles, vaccination is key, as it helped make measles rare before. With cases rising in states like South Carolina, Florida, and others, it's important for families to learn about this virus and take steps to stay healthy.",
