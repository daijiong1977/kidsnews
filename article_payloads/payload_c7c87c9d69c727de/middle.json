  "title": "Victory in Celebrity Race Across the World: Roman and Harleymoon's Journey",
  "summary": "Roman Kemp and his sister Harleymoon emerged as winners in the BBC's Celebrity Race Across the World series, completing a challenging 33-day, 5,900-kilometer journey through Central America. The race required teams to travel without phones or air travel, relying on a budget of £950 per person, equivalent to the cost of flying the route. In the final episode, they raced from Medellín to the Guajira Peninsula in Colombia, securing victory just two minutes ahead of Molly Rainford and Tyler West. Anita Rani and her father Bal finished six hours later, while Dylan Llewellyn and his mother Jackie withdrew earlier due to insufficient funds. The series, attracting around six million viewers, is the third celebrity edition of the show. Roman, a BBC One host, and Harleymoon, a country singer, described the final leg as highly adrenaline-filled and emotional. Other contestants included EastEnders actress Molly Rainford and radio host Tyler West, who met on Strictly Come Dancing. The race tested participants' resilience and resourcefulness across multiple countries, including Mexico, Guatemala, and Panama.",
