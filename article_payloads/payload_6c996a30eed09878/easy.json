  "title": "Japan's Leader Wins Big in Election",
  "summary": "In Japan, Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi and her party, the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), won a huge victory in a parliamentary election on Sunday. They got more than enough seats to have a supermajority, which means they can pass laws easily. Takaichi is the first female prime minister of Japan and is very popular. She wants to make Japan stronger and richer by improving the economy and military. Her party has been in power for a long time but had some problems recently, so she called this election early to get more support. With this win, she can work on her plans while dealing with tensions with China and building ties with the United States.",
