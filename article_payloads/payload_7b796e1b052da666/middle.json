  "title": "Reporting Under Pressure: A Journalist's Experience in Russia",
  "summary": "Steve Rosenberg, a BBC correspondent based in Moscow for over three decades, describes the increasing difficulties of journalism in Russia following the 2022 full-scale invasion of Ukraine. He reflects on his deep connection to Russian culture, having studied the language and music, but notes how the country he loved has changed dramatically. The invasion led to repressive laws that silence dissent and punish criticism, making accurate reporting a tightrope walk over a legal minefield. Rosenberg faces personal attacks from Russian TV hosts, like Vladimir Solovyov, who label him an enemy, highlighting the hostile environment for foreign journalists. The arrest of Wall Street Journal reporter Evan Gershkovich on espionage charges underscores the risks, showing that foreign passports offer little protection. This article explores the balance between honest journalism and survival in an authoritarian context, as Russia wages war in Ukraine and tightens control at home.",

    "This article discusses the challenges faced by foreign journalists in Russia, particularly after the 2022 invasion of Ukraine. Steve Rosenberg, a long-time BBC correspondent, shares his personal journey and the cultural ties he has with Russia. The invasion led to stricter laws that curb free speech, making it dangerous to report critically. Hostile rhetoric from media figures like Vladimir Solovyov adds to the pressure, while cases like Evan Gershkovich's arrest show the legal risks. Understanding this context helps explain the tightrope journalists must walk to report truthfully in an authoritarian environment."
