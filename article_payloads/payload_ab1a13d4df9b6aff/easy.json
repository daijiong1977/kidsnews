  "title": "How Eating Vitamin C Helps Your Skin",
  "summary": "Scientists found that eating more vitamin C can make your skin healthier. Vitamin C is a nutrient in foods like kiwifruit. When people eat vitamin C, it goes into their blood and then into their skin. This helps the skin make collagen, which makes skin thicker and stronger. It also helps the skin renew itself by growing new outer layers. The study was done with 24 adults in New Zealand and Germany. They ate two kiwifruits every day, and their skin got better. This shows that what you eat is important for skin health, not just creams you put on your skin. Vitamin C from food works better because skin absorbs it well from blood.",
