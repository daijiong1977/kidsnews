  "title": "Ants Choose More Friends Over Strong Armor",
  "summary": "This article is about ants and how they evolved to have many workers instead of strong armor. Scientists studied ants from all over the world using special 3D scans to see their exoskeletons, which is like their armor. They found that ants with big colonies, meaning lots of ants living together, have thinner armor. This is because if a colony has thousands of ants, losing a few to predators is not a big problem, so they don't need to spend energy making each ant super strong. Instead, they use that energy to make more ants. This trade-off helps ants survive and spread to new places faster. The research shows how teamwork in nature can lead to success by focusing on numbers over individual strength.",

    "Ants are insects that live in large groups called colonies, with different ants doing jobs like finding food or protecting the nest. They have a hard outer shell called an exoskeleton that acts like armor. Scientists study how ants evolve, or change over time, to understand why some have stronger armor and others have more ants in their colonies. This research helps us learn about teamwork in nature and how animals adapt to survive."
