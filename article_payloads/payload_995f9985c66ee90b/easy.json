  "title": "Tiny RNA Can Copy Itself",
  "summary": "Scientists have found a very small piece of RNA that can make copies of itself. RNA is like DNA and can carry information and help with chemical reactions. This discovery is important because it might explain how life started on Earth. Long ago, RNA molecules that could copy themselves could have been the first step to life. The new RNA is only 45 bases long, which is very short. It was found by testing many random RNA pieces in a lab. This tiny RNA can link small pieces together to build a copy. It works slowly but is a big discovery for understanding the origin of life.",

    "RNA is a molecule found in all living things. It is similar to DNA and helps cells make proteins and control activities. Scientists think that long ago, before there were cells, RNA might have been the first molecule to start life by copying itself. This new discovery of a very short RNA that can copy itself helps support this idea. It shows that even tiny molecules could have been important in the early Earth, leading to the development of life as we know it today."
