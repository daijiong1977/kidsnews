  "title": "Syphilis Started Long Ago: A 5,500-Year-Old Discovery",
  "summary": "Scientists found a very old fossil in Colombia that is 5,500 years old. This fossil has bacteria called Treponema pallidum, which causes diseases like syphilis. Syphilis is a sickness spread through sex. Before, people thought syphilis started in Europe in 1495 when a French king's army got sick in Naples, Italy. That event caused a big outbreak called the Great Pox, which spread across Europe and killed many people. Countries blamed each other for the disease, like calling it the French disease or Neapolitan disease. Some thought Columbus brought it from the Americas. But this new discovery shows syphilis is much older than we thought, going back thousands of years. It means syphilis did not have just one place of origin. The scientists found the bacteria in a hunter-gatherer man's bones without seeing any signs of sickness, which was lucky. This helps us understand that diseases can have long histories and change over time.",

    "Syphilis is a disease that spreads through sexual contact and can cause serious health problems. For a long time, people believed it started in Europe in the late 1400s during a war, leading to a pandemic that killed millions. Countries often blamed each other for diseases, like calling syphilis the French disease. New discoveries from old fossils show that syphilis is much older, dating back thousands of years, which changes our understanding of its history and origins."
