  "title": "A Smart Helper for Chemists",
  "summary": "Chemists have been trying for a long time to make a special chemical reaction work with common molecules called alkyl ketones. These molecules are found in many things, like medicines, but they are hard to change. A team of scientists from Hokkaido University created a smart helper called a catalyst that uses light to make this reaction happen. They used computers to find the best helper from many options. This new method helps chemists make new medicines and other important chemicals more easily. It's like finding a key to unlock a door that was stuck for years.",

    "Chemistry is the study of substances and how they change. Ketones are a type of molecule that chemists often work with to create new things like drugs. Radicals are very reactive parts that can help form new bonds. Catalysts are special helpers that make reactions happen without being used up. Scientists use computers to simulate experiments and save time. This article talks about a breakthrough where scientists solved a long-standing problem in chemistry."
