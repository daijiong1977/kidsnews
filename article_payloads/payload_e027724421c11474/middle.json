  "title": "Claire Foy's Parasite Infection and Health Changes",
  "summary": "Claire Foy, an award-winning actress best known for her role as Queen Elizabeth II in The Crown, revealed on a podcast that she suffered from parasites for at least five years. She believes she contracted the infection during a trip to Morocco, experiencing symptoms like unexplained weight loss. To address this, she avoided harsh antibiotics and instead took milder treatments, which included giving up caffeine. Additionally, Foy manages a separate autoimmune condition by eliminating gluten and sugar from her diet, except occasionally when dining out, to reduce inflammation. She humorously compared keeping this secret to being on a reality show. The NHS notes that worm infections, while potentially caught abroad or in the UK, are often not serious and treatable with medication, with symptoms including weight loss, rashes, or digestive issues. Foy's story highlights personal health management and raises awareness about parasitic infections.",
