  "title": "Claire Foy's Health Story",
  "summary": "Claire Foy is a famous actress who played Queen Elizabeth II in a TV show called The Crown. She recently shared that she had parasites in her body for five years. Parasites are tiny bugs that can live inside people and make them sick. She thinks she got them while visiting Morocco. Because of this, she lost weight and felt unwell. To get better, she stopped drinking caffeine and took some medicine. She also has an autoimmune condition, which means her body sometimes fights itself, so she avoids gluten and sugar to stay healthy. Doctors say worm infections like this are usually not serious and can be treated easily. Claire Foy is now doing well and continues to act in movies and shows.",

    "Claire Foy is a British actress known for playing Queen Elizabeth II in The Crown, a popular Netflix show. Parasites are small organisms that can live in humans and cause health problems like weight loss. An autoimmune condition is when the immune system attacks the body's own tissues. Gluten is found in foods like bread, and sugar is a common sweetener. Doctors often treat worm infections with medicine, and it's important to see a doctor if you have symptoms."
