    "Annie, derived from Harold Gray's comic strip, is a seminal musical that explores themes of hope and adversity through its orphan protagonist. Miss Hannigan, as the matron, represents institutional neglect and offers rich material for character analysis. La Voix, a drag artist from Buckinghamshire, emerged from RuPaul's Drag Race UK, a show that has amplified drag culture's visibility and discussed issues of gender and performance.

The UK touring model for musicals aims to democratize access to arts but involves complex logistics. This article, from BBC Entertainment, fits within entertainment journalism's role in shaping public discourse on arts careers, highlighting how performers navigate challenges and opportunities in a dynamic industry."
