  "title": "Farm Tax Changes: What's Happening?",
  "summary": "The government has decided not to make more changes to a tax plan for farms. This tax is called inheritance tax, which is money paid when someone passes on their farm to family. Originally, the government wanted to tax farms worth over £1 million at 20%, but after farmers protested, they changed it to only tax farms worth over £2.5 million. This means many farms won't have to pay this tax now. The environment secretary, Emma Reynolds, said the government listened to farmers who talked to them quietly, not those who made loud protests with tractors. Some groups, like the Country Land and Business Association, still don't like the tax and want to remove it completely. Other farmers are happy because the change helps their families keep their farms without paying extra money.",

    "Inheritance tax is a tax that people pay when they receive property or money from someone who has passed away. In the UK, the government sometimes changes tax rules to help different groups, like farmers. Farms are important for growing food and taking care of animals. When the government makes new tax plans, people often share their opinions through protests or meetings to try to change the rules."
