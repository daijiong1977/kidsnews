  "title": "Design Breakthrough Enhances Solid-State Battery Performance",
  "summary": "Batteries are essential for modern technology, but issues like high costs and safety risks, such as fires, persist. Solid-state batteries offer a safer alternative by using solid electrolytes instead of liquid ones, yet they face challenges in performance due to slow lithium-ion movement. A research team in South Korea, led by Professor Dong-Hwa Seo from KAIST, has made a significant breakthrough by improving battery design without relying on expensive metals. They focused on zirconium-based halide solid electrolytes and introduced divalent anions like oxygen and sulfur through a 'Framework Regulation Mechanism.' This adjustment expands the internal pathways, reducing energy barriers and allowing lithium ions to move two to four times faster. Advanced tools confirmed these structural changes, leading to ionic conductivities above 1 mS/cm at room temperature, suitable for practical use. The study emphasizes a shift in battery research from material selection to structural design, potentially lowering costs and enhancing safety for applications in electric vehicles and electronics.",
