  "title": "A Smart Design Fix for Safer Batteries",
  "summary": "Batteries are important for things like phones and cars, but they can be expensive and sometimes catch fire. Scientists in South Korea have found a new way to make batteries safer and better without using costly materials. They worked on solid-state batteries, which are safer because they use solid parts instead of liquid ones that can leak. The problem was that lithium ions, which help batteries work, move slowly in solids. The researchers changed the design of the battery material by adding elements like oxygen or sulfur. This made the pathways inside the material wider, so lithium ions can move faster. They tested it and saw big improvements, making the batteries work well at room temperature. This smart design could help make batteries cheaper and safer for everyone.",

    "Batteries are everywhere in our lives, from toys to electric cars. They store energy so we can use devices without being plugged in. Traditional batteries sometimes have problems like catching fire or costing too much. Scientists are always looking for better ways to make batteries. In this article, researchers in South Korea found a new design trick using simple elements to make safer, cheaper batteries that work well. This could mean better gadgets and cleaner transportation in the future."
