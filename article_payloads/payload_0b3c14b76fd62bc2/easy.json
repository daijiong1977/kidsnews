  "title": "A Rusty Mineral That Traps Carbon",
  "summary": "Scientists have found that a rusty mineral called ferrihydrite is great at trapping carbon, which helps keep it out of the air and stops climate change. This mineral is a type of iron oxide, like rust, and it uses different ways to grab and hold onto carbon. It has tiny spots with positive and negative charges that let it stick to many kinds of carbon. By forming strong bonds, it locks carbon in place for a long time, sometimes decades or centuries. This process happens in soil, which stores a lot of carbon. Understanding this helps scientists learn how to protect our planet better.",

    "Carbon is a part of air that can trap heat and cause climate change. Minerals like ferrihydrite in soil help by grabbing carbon and keeping it underground. This is important because soil stores a lot of carbon, almost as much as the ocean. Scientists study this to help the Earth stay cool."
