  "title": "Black Holes and Their Changing Light",
  "summary": "Scientists have found that black holes might be changing over time. Black holes are super strong areas in space that pull in everything around them, including light. They are often surrounded by a bright disk of hot material called an accretion disk. This disk makes ultraviolet light, which can turn into X-rays when it passes through a hot cloud called the corona. For a long time, astronomers thought this process was the same everywhere in the universe. But a new study shows that when the universe was younger, about half its current age, the way ultraviolet and X-ray light worked together was different. This means the material around black holes might have changed over billions of years. The research was done by an international team and could change what we know about black holes. Quasars, which are very bright objects powered by black holes, helped scientists see these changes from far away.",

    "Black holes are mysterious objects in space with gravity so strong that nothing, not even light, can escape them. They are often found at the centers of galaxies. When material falls into a black hole, it heats up and glows brightly, creating light that astronomers can study. This helps scientists learn about how black holes grow and affect their surroundings. The new study suggests that this process might have been different in the past, which could change our understanding of the universe's history."
