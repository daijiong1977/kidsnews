  "title": "Evolving Black Holes: A Challenge to Cosmic Constants",
  "summary": "Astronomers have discovered evidence that the material surrounding supermassive black holes may not be constant throughout cosmic history. Using observations of quasars—extremely luminous objects powered by black holes—an international team led by the National Observatory of Athens found that the relationship between ultraviolet and X-ray emissions has changed over time. Quasars emit light from an accretion disk, which produces ultraviolet radiation. This light interacts with a corona of energized particles to generate X-rays. For nearly 50 years, scientists assumed this ultraviolet-X-ray connection was universal, implying stable conditions around black holes. However, the new study, published in Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society, reveals that in the younger universe (about half its current age), this relationship differed from what is observed in nearby quasars today. This suggests that the accretion disk and corona may have evolved over approximately 6.5 billion years, potentially altering how black holes grow and radiate energy. The researchers used multiple methods to confirm their findings, challenging long-held astronomical principles and prompting a reevaluation of black hole behavior across cosmic epochs.",

    "Black holes are regions in space where gravity is so intense that nothing, not even light, can escape. Supermassive black holes, located at galaxy centers, can have masses billions of times that of the sun. They often accrete surrounding matter, forming hot accretion disks that emit vast amounts of radiation, including ultraviolet light. Quasars are among the brightest objects in the universe, powered by this process. For decades, astronomers have used the relationship between ultraviolet and X-ray emissions from quasars to infer properties of black hole environments, assuming it was constant. This study questions that assumption by analyzing data from different cosmic times, suggesting that black hole systems may evolve, which has implications for understanding galaxy formation and cosmic history."

  "Article_Structure": [
    "The article presents main points about evidence that material around supermassive black holes has changed over cosmic time, challenging the universal ultraviolet-X-ray relation. Its purpose is to report a scientific discovery that could reshape astronomical theories. The evidence evaluation is strong, based on quasar observations and multiple methodological approaches, though it requires further confirmation. Author credibility is high, with researchers from an international team and publication in a reputable journal. Methodology involves analyzing light from quasars across different epochs to compare ultraviolet and X-ray emissions."
