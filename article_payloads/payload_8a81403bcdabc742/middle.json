  "title": "Unveiling a Rapidly Growing Black Hole in the Early Universe",
  "summary": "Astronomers have discovered an unusual quasar in the early Universe that hosts a supermassive black hole growing at an exceptionally high rate. Using data from the Subaru Telescope, the international team observed that this black hole is accreting matter at about 13 times the Eddington limit, a theoretical maximum for growth. Surprisingly, it also emits intense X-rays and produces a strong radio jet, features that existing models suggest should not coexist during such rapid growth. The quasar, located about 12 billion years ago, provides insights into how supermassive black holes achieved massive sizes so early in cosmic history. Researchers propose it might be in a transitional phase following a sudden gas influx, allowing super-Eddington accretion while maintaining active corona and jet emissions. This challenges current theories and offers a rare opportunity to study black hole evolution. The findings, published in the Astrophysical Journal, could advance our understanding of galaxy formation, as the jet's energy may influence star formation and galactic development.",

    "Black holes are regions in space with immense gravity, and supermassive ones reside at galaxy centers, growing by accreting gas. Quasars are their active, luminous phases. The Eddington limit sets a growth cap due to radiation, but super-Eddington accretion may occur in extreme conditions. This article discusses a quasar defying expectations by growing rapidly while emitting X-rays and radio jets, offering clues about early Universe black hole formation and galaxy evolution. Understanding these processes helps scientists piece together cosmic history."
