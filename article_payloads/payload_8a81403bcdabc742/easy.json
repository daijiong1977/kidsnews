  "title": "A Super-Fast Growing Black Hole in Space",
  "summary": "Astronomers found a special space object called a quasar with a supermassive black hole that is growing very quickly. This black hole is pulling in gas and dust at a super-fast rate, much faster than scientists thought was possible. It also gives off strong X-rays and radio waves, which is unusual because these things don't usually happen together. The black hole is very old, from about 12 billion years ago, and it helps us learn how black holes grew so big so early in the Universe. Scientists used a big telescope called Subaru to study it. They think this quasar might be in a short phase where it gets a lot of gas suddenly, making it grow extra fast. This discovery helps us understand more about space and how galaxies form.",

    "Black holes are mysterious places in space where gravity is super strong. They can grow by eating gas and dust around them. When they are very bright and active, they are called quasars. Scientists study them to learn about the early Universe and how galaxies form. This article talks about a special black hole that is growing faster than expected and giving off unusual signals, which helps scientists solve puzzles about space."
