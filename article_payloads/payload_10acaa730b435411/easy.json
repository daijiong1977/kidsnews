  "title": "Former CDC Leaders Talk About Problems at the Health Agency",
  "summary": "This article is about three former leaders from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) who are speaking out. They worked at the CDC, which is a health agency that helps keep people safe from diseases. They left their jobs because they were unhappy with the new Health Secretary, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who has ideas that go against science. He fired the CDC director and made changes that hurt the agency's work. The three leaders, Drs. Demetre Daskalakis, Debra Houry, and Daniel Jernigan, managed important health programs like fighting flu and COVID-19. They will talk in a live event about how Kennedy's actions are affecting public health and why it's important to follow evidence instead of bad ideas. The event is on Tuesday, December 16, at 2 pm ET.",

    "The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is a government agency in the United States that helps protect people from diseases like flu, COVID-19, and measles. It gives advice on vaccines and health practices. Leaders at the CDC are experts who manage health programs. Recently, a new Health Secretary, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who does not believe in some science, has made changes that upset many CDC workers. Three top leaders resigned because they felt Kennedy's ideas could harm public health. They are now sharing their experiences in a public talk to explain why following science is important for keeping everyone healthy."
