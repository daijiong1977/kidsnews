  "title": "Norrie's Defeat to Zverev Ends British Singles Campaign at Australian Open",
  "summary": "Cameron Norrie, the British number two tennis player, was defeated by Alexander Zverev in the third round of the Australian Open, concluding British participation in the singles event. Norrie, who has frequently been the last Briton in Grand Slam tournaments, faced a tough challenge against world number three Zverev, having lost all previous six meetings. The match saw Norrie produce an inspired second set to level the score, but Zverev regained control in the third and fourth sets, winning 7-5, 4-6, 6-3, 6-1. Despite strong crowd support at Melbourne Park, Norrie struggled against Zverev's elevated play, particularly in the latter stages. Zverev's victory, marked by his 16th ace, advances him to the next round against Francisco Cerundolo, while Norrie's quest to beat a top-five player at a Grand Slam remains unfulfilled. The article highlights Norrie's resilience but underscores Zverev's dominance in their head-to-head record.",
