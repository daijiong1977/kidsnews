  "title": "Solving a 700-Year-Old Royal Murder Mystery",
  "summary": "Scientists have used new tools to solve a very old mystery about a duke who was killed long ago. Duke Béla of Macsó was a young nobleman who lived 700 years ago. He had family roots from Scandinavia and the Rurik dynasty. In 1272, he was attacked and killed in a planned and emotional way. Researchers studied his bones and other clues to find out how he died and who he was. This discovery helps us learn more about history and how science can answer big questions from the past. It shows that even after many years, we can uncover secrets using genetics and forensics.",
