  "title": "25-Year Wait Ends: Rolling Stones Approve Fatboy Slim's Sampled Track",
  "summary": "Fatboy Slim, a prominent DJ, created 'Satisfaction Skank' 25 years ago by sampling the iconic riff from the Rolling Stones' 'Satisfaction' and blending it with his track 'The Rockafeller Skank'. Initially, he used it as a secret encore in live performances, but it gained widespread popularity through bootleg copies and file-sharing platforms like Napster. Despite its underground success, the Rolling Stones repeatedly denied clearance for commercial release over two decades, even after Mick Jagger expressed personal approval. Recent shifts in the band's attitude towards music reuse led to a reversal: they not only granted permission but also provided master tapes for a higher-quality mix. This decision reflects a broader trend of the Rolling Stones becoming more lenient with their catalog, as seen with their handling of The Verve's 'Bittersweet Symphony'. The release marks a significant moment in music history, highlighting evolving perspectives on copyright and artistic collaboration.",
