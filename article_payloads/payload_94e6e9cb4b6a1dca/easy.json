  "title": "Fatboy Slim's Secret Song Gets a Yes After 25 Years",
  "summary": "A famous DJ named Fatboy Slim made a cool song 25 years ago by using a small part of music from the Rolling Stones' hit 'Satisfaction'. He called it 'Satisfaction Skank' and played it at his concerts as a special surprise. For many years, the Rolling Stones said no to letting him sell the song because they own the original music. But now, after 25 years, they have finally said yes! This means people can buy and listen to the song legally. The Rolling Stones even helped by giving Fatboy Slim their original recordings to make the song sound better. This shows that the band is now more open to letting others use their music in new ways.",
