  "title": "African Union Stops Guinea-Bissau After Army Takes Over",
  "summary": "The African Union, a group of African countries, has suspended Guinea-Bissau because its military took control in a coup. A coup is when the army removes the government without following the rules. This happened after an election where two people said they won. The African Union does not allow this and has stopped Guinea-Bissau from joining its activities until the country follows its constitution again. The former president left for another country, and a new government was set up by the military leader. Guinea-Bissau has had many coups in the past and is a poor country with problems like drug trafficking. Other groups like ECOWAS have also suspended it.",

    "Guinea-Bissau is a small country in West Africa that became independent from Portugal over 50 years ago. It has faced many political problems, including military takeovers called coups. The African Union is an organization that promotes peace and cooperation among African nations and does not allow governments to be changed unfairly. ECOWAS is another group in West Africa that works on economic and political issues. Drug trafficking is a big problem in Guinea-Bissau, where illegal drugs are moved through the country, making it hard to have stable leadership."
