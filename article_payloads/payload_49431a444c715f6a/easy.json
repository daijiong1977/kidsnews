  "title": "Lord Mandelson's Pay-Off Review",
  "summary": "The UK Foreign Office is checking a payment given to Lord Mandelson after he was fired as the US ambassador. He got this money because he was let go from his job. The review started because new information came out about Mandelson talking to Jeffrey Epstein, a man who was in trouble for bad things. The police are also looking into this in the UK. Some government people say Mandelson should give the money back or donate it to a charity that helps victims. Mandelson's lawyers have not commented yet. The payment might be around £40,000, which is like three months of salary for his old job. The government will share more details about this payment soon because Parliament asked for it. Mandelson had contact with Epstein even after Epstein was convicted, and this was known when Mandelson got the ambassador job, but he was fired when more emails showed he supported Epstein.",

    "Lord Mandelson was a UK ambassador to the US, a job where he represented Britain in America. He got a pay-off, which is money given when someone loses their job, after being fired. Jeffrey Epstein was a wealthy man convicted of sex crimes, and Mandelson had contact with him. The UK government is checking if the pay-off was fair because of this connection. Police are involved to investigate further. This story shows how people in important jobs must be careful about who they associate with."
