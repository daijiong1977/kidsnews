  "title": "A Big New Room for the White House",
  "summary": "Some people chosen by President Trump are talking about a big new ballroom for the White House. They had a meeting to look at plans for the ballroom, which would be very large and change how the White House looks. The ballroom is meant for big parties and events, so the president doesn't have to use tents outside. The people at the meeting asked to see 3D models to better understand the size and design. Many other people who wrote comments online don't like the plan because they think it's too big or not done the right way. The president's team says he wants to make the White House more beautiful. The ballroom would add a lot of space to the White House, which is already a historic building.",

    "The White House is where the U.S. president lives and works. It's a historic building in Washington D.C. that has been changed over time. Presidents often host big events like State Dinners for important guests. Sometimes, they use tents outside because there isn't enough room inside. This article talks about a plan to build a new ballroom to make more space for these events. Some people worry it might change the White House too much."
