  "title": "US Stock Market Climbs to Record Highs in 2025 Despite Trade Volatility",
  "summary": "The US stock market experienced significant volatility in 2025, marked by a sharp decline in spring due to President Donald Trump's global trade tariffs, which nearly pushed the S&P 500 into bear market territory—a 20% drop from recent highs. However, by summer, markets rebounded strongly, fueled by robust corporate profits and heightened investor confidence in artificial intelligence (AI) investments. The S&P 500 is set to close the year up approximately 17%, marking its third consecutive year of double-digit gains, while the technology-focused Nasdaq Composite index gained 21%, and the Russell 2000 index of smaller companies rose about 12%. Despite this rally, concerns persist regarding economic jitters, leadership changes at the US central bank, and potential overvaluation of AI stocks. Analysts, such as Robert Edwards and Parag Thatte, note that the market has 'climbed the wall of worry' and predict 2026 could be another record-setting year, partly due to anticipated lower borrowing costs that may boost earnings. Meanwhile, geopolitical tensions and tariff uncertainties drove demand for safe-haven assets like gold, which surged nearly 70%, whereas Bitcoin underperformed, ending the year slightly lower after a decline from its October peaks.",
