  "title": "US Stock Market Finishes 2025 with Big Gains After a Wild Year",
  "summary": "The US stock market had a very up-and-down year in 2025, but it ended on a high note with big gains. In the spring, President Trump's trade tariffs caused stocks to drop almost into a bear market, which means a 20% fall. But by summer, stocks bounced back and reached record highs because companies made good profits and people were excited about investing in artificial intelligence (AI). The S&P 500 index is up about 17% for the year, and the Nasdaq Composite index is up 21%. Even though there are worries about the economy and AI stocks being too expensive, analysts think 2026 could be another great year for stocks, helped by lower borrowing costs. Gold also did well, up nearly 70%, but Bitcoin struggled and is ending the year a bit lower.",
