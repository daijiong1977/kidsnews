    "Tennis is a popular sport played all over the world. Players use rackets to hit a ball back and forth over a net. Matches are divided into sets, and the player who wins the most sets wins the match. Tournaments like the Merida Open bring together players from different countries to compete for titles. Winning runs happen when a player keeps winning games, which builds confidence."
