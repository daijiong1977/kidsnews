  "title": "Paolini's Comeback Victory Over Boulter at Merida Open",
  "summary": "In the quarter-finals of the Merida Open in Mexico, British tennis player Katie Boulter faced Italian top seed Jasmine Paolini, the world number seven. Boulter began impressively, winning the first set 6-0 in just 28 minutes without conceding a game, capitalizing on her recent seven-match winning streak that included an Ostrava Open title. However, Paolini, a 2024 Wimbledon and French Open finalist, regrouped in the second set, improving her serve and depth of play to win 6-3. The decisive third set saw Paolini take an early lead, and despite Boulter briefly leading 3-2, Paolini won four consecutive games to secure a 6-3 victory and a semi-final spot. Paolini attributed her win to staying calm under pressure and adjusting her strategy by hitting deeper and harder shots. This match ended Boulter's winning run and highlighted Paolini's resilience and tactical adaptability in competitive tennis.",
