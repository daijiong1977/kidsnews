  "title": "Mexico's President Wants More BTS Concerts for Fans",
  "summary": "Mexico's president, Claudia Sheinbaum, asked South Korea's president for more BTS concerts in Mexico. BTS is a popular K-pop band that is going on a big world tour after four years. They will have three shows in Mexico City in May, but tickets sold out very fast in less than 40 minutes. Many young people wanted tickets, but there were not enough for everyone. Some people are selling tickets for much higher prices, which is not fair. The president hopes South Korea will say yes to more shows so more fans can see BTS. BTS is very loved in Mexico, and listening to K-pop has grown a lot there.",
