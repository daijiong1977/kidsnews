  "title": "Mexico's President Seeks Additional BTS Concerts Amid High Demand",
  "summary": "Mexico's President Claudia Sheinbaum has formally requested South Korea's President Lee Jae Myung to add more BTS concerts in Mexico, following the rapid sell-out of tickets for the band's upcoming tour. BTS, a globally renowned K-pop group, is embarking on a 79-date world tour after a four-year hiatus, with three shows scheduled in Mexico City in May. Tickets for these concerts sold out in under 40 minutes, highlighting intense demand from approximately one million young fans competing for 150,000 tickets. Sheinbaum emphasized BTS's popularity in Mexico, where K-pop streaming has surged over 500% in five years, making it the fifth-largest market worldwide. The ticketing process has faced issues, including allegations of dynamic pricing by Ticketmaster and resale platforms like StubHub and Viagogo, which have been sanctioned by Mexico's consumer watchdog for unfair practices. Despite the promoter's claim that the band's packed itinerary makes additional shows unfeasible, Sheinbaum remains hopeful for a positive response from South Korea, though officials there have declined to comment. This situation underscores the economic and cultural impact of BTS, with the tour projected to generate over $1 billion in revenue.",
