  "title": "Your Brain Grows and Changes Through Life",
  "summary": "Scientists have found that our brains go through five important stages as we grow up and get older. They studied brain scans from about 4,000 people up to age 90. The brain changes a lot during childhood, then becomes more efficient starting around age nine. Surprisingly, the teenage brain phase lasts until our early thirties, which is when our brains work their best. After that, there are more changes as we get older. This research helps us understand why mental health problems and diseases like dementia can happen at different times in life. The brain is always learning and adapting, but it does so in clear steps, not smoothly.",

    "The brain is an amazing part of our body that controls everything we do, like thinking, learning, and feeling. As we grow from babies to adults and then get older, our brains change in different ways. Scientists use tools like brain scans to see inside the brain and learn how it works. This study looked at many people's brains to find out when big changes happen. It's important because it helps doctors and families understand brain health better, especially for issues like feeling sad or confused when older."
