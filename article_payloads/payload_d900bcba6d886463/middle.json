  "title": "Brain Development Phases: Key Ages and Their Impact",
  "summary": "A recent study from the University of Cambridge has identified five distinct phases of brain development throughout life, with significant turning points at ages nine, 32, 66, and 83. Researchers analyzed brain scans from approximately 4,000 individuals aged up to 90 to examine the connections between brain cells. They discovered that the brain remains in an adolescent phase until the early thirties, which is when cognitive functions peak. This challenges previous beliefs that adolescence ends in the teenage years. The study, published in Nature Communications, highlights that brain changes are not gradual but occur in phases, involving the strengthening and weakening of neural connections. These findings could improve our understanding of why the risk for mental health disorders and dementia varies across different life stages, offering insights for future medical research and treatments.",

    "Brain development is a complex process that involves changes in structure and function from infancy to old age. Neuroscientists study how neural connections form and change, using technologies like MRI scans to observe the brain. Adolescence is a critical period marked by puberty and brain maturation, but recent studies suggest it lasts longer than previously thought. Understanding these phases helps explain variations in cognitive abilities and health risks, such as mental illnesses and neurodegenerative diseases. This research builds on decades of neuroscience, emphasizing that brain plasticity allows adaptation throughout life, but in distinct stages rather than continuously."

  "Article_Structure": [
    "This article's main points highlight five brain phases with key ages, showing that adolescence extends to the early 30s when cognitive peak occurs. The purpose is to inform the public about new findings that challenge old beliefs and aid in understanding mental health risks. Evidence evaluation is strong, based on 4,000 brain scans from a reputable study published in Nature Communications, providing quantitative data. Author credibility is high, as researchers from the University of Cambridge are experts in neuroscience. Methodology involved analyzing brain scan data to identify connection patterns, using a large sample size for reliability."
