  "title": "How Food Additives Can Affect Baby Mice's Health",
  "summary": "Scientists studied mother mice that ate food with emulsifiers, which are ingredients in processed foods like ice cream and baby formula. They found that this changed the gut bacteria in their baby mice. These changes made the baby mice more likely to get sick with gut diseases and become overweight when they grew up. The baby mice never ate the emulsifiers themselves, but got them from their mothers. This shows that what mothers eat can affect their babies' health for life. The researchers say we need more studies to see if this happens in humans too, especially for babies who drink formula with emulsifiers.",

    "This article is about a science study on mice. Scientists fed mother mice special food ingredients called emulsifiers, which are in many foods we eat, like cookies and baby formula. They wanted to see if this affected the baby mice's health. They found that the baby mice had different gut bacteria and were more likely to get sick later. This is important because it shows how a mother's diet can impact her children, even if the children don't eat the same things. It helps us think about food safety and health for families."
