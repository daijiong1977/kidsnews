  "title": "Imran Khan and Wife Receive 17-Year Sentence in Graft Case",
  "summary": "A Pakistani court has convicted former Prime Minister Imran Khan and his wife Bushra Bibi, sentencing them to 17 years in prison for retaining and selling state gifts while he was in office. The case centered on gifts from foreign dignitaries, including jewelry from Saudi Arabia, which they allegedly sold at prices far below their market value of $285,521, declaring them at only over $10,000. Khan and his wife pleaded not guilty, and his lawyer announced plans to appeal the ruling, arguing the conviction lacked proof of intent or gain. The trial took place in Adiala prison in Rawalpindi, with Khan's Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) party criticizing it as a 'closed-door jail trial' that denied family access and fairness, calling it a 'black chapter in history.' In contrast, Information Minister Attaullah Tarar defended the court's decision, stating it was based on solid evidence and delivered fairly. This case highlights ongoing tensions in Pakistan's political and judicial systems, with accusations of selective prosecution and debates over the rule of law.",

    "This article discusses a high-profile corruption case in Pakistan involving Imran Khan, a former prime minister and prominent political figure. Pakistan has a history of political turmoil, with leaders often facing legal challenges. The case revolves around laws requiring government officials to declare and sometimes purchase gifts from foreign dignitaries at market value to prevent corruption. The trial's location in prison and accusations of unfairness reflect broader issues in Pakistan's judiciary, such as political influence and access to justice. Understanding this context helps explain why the case has sparked debate about selective prosecution and the integrity of legal processes in the country."
