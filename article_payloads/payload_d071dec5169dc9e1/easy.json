  "title": "Former Leader and Wife Sent to Prison for Gifts",
  "summary": "In Pakistan, a former prime minister named Imran Khan and his wife Bushra Bibi were found guilty in court and sentenced to 17 years in prison. This happened because they kept and sold gifts from other countries while he was in office. The gifts included jewelry from Saudi Arabia. The court said they sold the gifts for much less money than they were worth. Khan and his wife said they did not do anything wrong. Khan's lawyer plans to ask a higher court to review the decision. Some people, like Khan's party, think the trial was not fair because it was held in prison and his family could not watch. Others, like the government, say the court looked at good evidence and made a fair choice. This case is part of bigger problems in Pakistan about justice and politics.",

    "This story is about a legal case in Pakistan, a country in South Asia. Imran Khan was the prime minister, which is like the leader of the government. When leaders get gifts from other countries, they often have to follow special rules, like buying them at the right price. Sometimes, people disagree about whether trials are fair, especially in politics. This helps us understand how laws work and why justice is important in different places."
