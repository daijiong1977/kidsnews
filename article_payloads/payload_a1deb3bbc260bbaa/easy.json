  "title": "A Fun Way to Recycle Teflon",
  "summary": "Scientists have found a new way to recycle Teflon, a strong plastic used in non-stick pans and other items. Teflon is hard to break down and often ends up in landfills, which can harm the environment. But researchers from Newcastle University and the University of Birmingham discovered that by shaking Teflon with sodium metal at room temperature, they can turn it into useful materials like sodium fluoride, which is in toothpaste. This method is clean and doesn't use harmful chemicals, helping to reduce waste and protect our planet. It's exciting because it makes recycling easier and turns old Teflon into something new and valuable.",

    "Teflon is a type of plastic that is very strong and does not stick to food, so it is used in pans to make cooking easier. But when Teflon is thrown away, it does not break down easily and can stay in the environment for a long time, which is bad for nature. Scientists are always looking for ways to recycle materials to keep the earth clean. Recycling means taking old items and making them into new things instead of throwing them in the trash. This helps save resources and reduces pollution."
