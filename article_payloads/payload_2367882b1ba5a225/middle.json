  "title": "Punam Krishan's Journey Through Breast Cancer Diagnosis and Recovery",
  "summary": "Punam Krishan, a 42-year-old GP and TV doctor known for BBC's Morning Live and Strictly Come Dancing, publicly revealed her breast cancer diagnosis after five months of private treatment. She described the emotional shock and trauma of receiving such news, despite her professional background as a doctor supporting patients for nearly two decades. Krishan emphasized that medical knowledge offered little comfort during her personal crisis. She completed her treatment and is currently in the healing phase, expressing gratitude towards the NHS team for their care while acknowledging the ongoing difficulty of the experience. To protect her energy and children, she kept the diagnosis private initially, relying on her husband, family, and close friends for support. By sharing her story on Instagram, Krishan aims to promote honesty and highlight that life often involves struggles beyond public perceptions. Her husband, Dr. Sandesh Gulhane, a Scottish Conservative health spokesman, stood by her during this time.",

    "Breast cancer is a malignant tumor that develops in breast cells, often detected through screenings like mammograms. Treatment typically involves surgery, chemotherapy, radiation, or targeted therapy, depending on the stage and type. In the UK, the NHS provides comprehensive care, but patients may face emotional and physical challenges. Public figures sharing health struggles can reduce stigma and encourage early detection, highlighting the importance of support systems and honest communication in healthcare."
