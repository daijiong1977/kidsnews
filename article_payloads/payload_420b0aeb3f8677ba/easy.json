  "title": "A Simple Blood Test to Predict Alzheimer's Disease",
  "summary": "Scientists have created a new blood test that can predict when someone might start showing signs of Alzheimer's disease, a brain illness that affects memory. This test measures a protein in the blood called p tau217. By checking this protein, doctors can estimate if symptoms like forgetting things will begin in about three to four years. This helps because Alzheimer's has no cure yet, but knowing early can allow people to plan and join studies to slow it down. The test is cheaper and easier than brain scans. Researchers studied over 600 older adults to make this test work. It could help speed up finding treatments and support patients and doctors in making better health plans.",

    "Alzheimer's disease is a common brain condition that affects millions of people, especially older adults. It causes memory loss and thinking problems, and there is no cure yet. Doctors use tests like brain scans to check for it, but they can be expensive and hard to get. This new blood test offers a simpler way to predict when symptoms might start, helping people prepare and researchers find better treatments faster."
