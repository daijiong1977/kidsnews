  "title": "Twisted Magnets Make Tiny Data Storage",
  "summary": "Scientists have found a new way to store lots of data in a very small space using magnets. They used a special material called chromium iodide, which is made of only a few layers of atoms. By twisting two layers of this material, they created tiny magnetic swirls called skyrmions. These skyrmions are super small and strong, so they can hold information safely without getting messed up by the environment. This discovery helps make future computers and phones able to store more pictures, videos, and files in less space. The researchers used a special microscope to see these tiny magnets because they are very hard to detect. This work is important for making better technology and learning about how magnets work in thin materials.",

    "Magnets are used in many devices like computers to store information. Scientists are always trying to make storage smaller so we can save more data. Thin materials, like chromium iodide, have only a few layers of atoms and can act differently than thicker ones. By twisting these layers, new magnetic patterns like skyrmions form, which are very stable and tiny. This helps in making future gadgets more efficient."
