  "title": "Behind the Scenes of Small Prophets: Filming a Comedy in Manchester",
  "summary": "Small Prophets is a new six-part comedy series on BBC Two, written and directed by Mackenzie Crook, who also stars alongside Sir Michael Palin. Filmed over seven weeks in Greater Manchester locations like Urmston and Stockport, the show features a storyline where Pearce Quigley's character Michael investigates his girlfriend's disappearance, aided by his father Brian (played by Palin) who cultivates prophesying spirits in jars using an ancient recipe involving rainwater and horse manure. Crook developed the script over a decade, inspired by a story about jar-grown creatures, and emphasized his desire to collaborate with friend Pearce Quigley, which helped shape the narrative. Local residents welcomed the production, with Sally Sadler sharing her surreal experience of her house being used as a set, and cast member Lauren Patel highlighted the cool aspect of filming in her hometown Manchester. The series will air on BBC Two and BBC iPlayer, showcasing Northern talent and community involvement.",
