  "title": "Delhi's Air Makes Many People Sick",
  "summary": "In Delhi, India, many people are getting sick because the air is very dirty. Over 200,000 cases of breathing problems were recorded in six big hospitals from 2022 to 2024. More than 30,000 people had to go to the hospital because they couldn't breathe well. The air quality is often very bad, especially in winter, and it can be 20 times worse than what is safe. This happens because of things like cars, factories, and farmers burning leftover crops. The government is studying this problem, and courts are asking for action to clean the air. Kids are also getting sick from the dirty air, so it's a big issue for everyone.",
