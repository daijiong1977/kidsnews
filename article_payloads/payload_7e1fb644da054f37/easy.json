  "title": "Oil Companies and Venezuela's Big Oil Plan",
  "summary": "President Trump met with oil company leaders at the White House to talk about a plan for American companies to help Venezuela with its oil. Venezuela has the most oil in the world, but it only produces a little bit right now. The plan is for companies to spend a lot of money, like $100 billion, to fix Venezuela's oil equipment and systems. In return, the U.S. will start using and selling some of Venezuela's oil. The president promised to keep everything safe. An expert named Bob McNally, who knows a lot about energy, joined to explain more about what might happen next with this plan.",
