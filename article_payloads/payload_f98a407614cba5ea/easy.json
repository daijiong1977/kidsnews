  "title": "Virgin Media Fined for Not Helping People in Need",
  "summary": "Virgin Media, a big phone company, got a huge fine of £24 million because it did not protect some customers during a change to new phone lines. These customers use special alarms called telecare to call for help in emergencies, like if they fall or feel sick. The alarms work through landlines, and when Virgin Media switched to digital lines, many alarms stopped working. This left elderly and disabled people without a way to get help quickly, which could be very dangerous. The company did not make sure these customers were safe during the change. A group called Ofcom, which watches over phone companies, gave the fine to teach Virgin Media and other companies to be more careful with vulnerable people. Virgin Media said it is now making things better for customers.",

  "background_read": [
    "Telecare alarms are important safety devices that many elderly or disabled people rely on to get help in emergencies. They connect to landline phones, so when companies like Virgin Media change to digital phone lines, they must ensure these alarms still work. If not, people could be left without a way to call for help, which is very risky. Ofcom is a regulator that checks if companies follow rules to protect customers, especially those who are vulnerable."
