  "title": "What is a Panto Dame?",
  "summary": "A panto dame is a funny character in Christmas pantomime shows. They are usually men dressed as women with big hair, loud makeup, and silly clothes. They act in a loud and brash way to make everyone laugh, both kids and adults. The dame talks to the audience, tells jokes, and makes people feel happy. They are not shy; they are warm and larger than life. In shows like Cinderella or Snow Queen, the dame might be a silly sister or a funny aunt. Their job is to steal the show and make the play fun for everyone.",
