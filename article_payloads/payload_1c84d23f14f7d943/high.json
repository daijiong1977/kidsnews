  "title": "Challenging Synaptic Pruning: Adolescent Brain Development and Synapse Hotspot Formation",
  "summary": "A groundbreaking study from Kyushu University redefines our understanding of adolescent brain development by identifying synapse hotspots that emerge during this critical period. Utilizing SeeDB2 for tissue clearing and super-resolution microscopy, researchers mapped dendritic spines in Layer 5 neurons of the mouse cerebral cortex, uncovering a localized high-density region that forms between three to eight weeks of age. This discovery challenges the predominant synaptic pruning hypothesis, suggesting that adolescence involves not only the elimination of connections but also the targeted formation of new synapses. The research further investigates implications for schizophrenia, demonstrating that mice with mutations in genes like Setd1a exhibit impaired hotspot development. These findings underscore the complexity of neural circuit maturation and propose that disruptions in synapse formation, rather than pruning alone, may underlie certain neuropsychiatric conditions, offering new avenues for therapeutic intervention.",
