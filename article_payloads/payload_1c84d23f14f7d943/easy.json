  "title": "Teen Brains Grow New Connection Spots",
  "summary": "Scientists have found something new in teen brains. They discovered that during the teenage years, brains don't just lose connections; they also make new, tight clusters of synapses in specific spots. Synapses are like tiny bridges between brain cells that help messages travel. This happens in a part of the brain called the cerebral cortex, especially in Layer 5 neurons, which help control thinking. The researchers used special tools to see these spots in mice brains. They found that these clusters appear during adolescence and might be linked to brain disorders like schizophrenia. This new idea challenges the old theory that teen brains only prune or cut back connections. It shows that brain development is more complex, with both losing and making connections at the same time.",

    "The brain is like a supercomputer that grows as we get older. During the teenage years, it changes a lot to help with thinking and decision-making. Scientists used to think brains only cut back connections in teens, but new research shows they also make new ones in special spots. This might help us understand brain disorders better."
