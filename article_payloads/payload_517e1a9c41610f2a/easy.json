  "title": "Turning Bad Air into Clean Fuel with a Special Helper",
  "summary": "Scientists have found a new way to help clean the air and make clean fuel. They use a special helper called a catalyst made from manganese, which is a common and cheap metal. This catalyst can change carbon dioxide, a gas that pollutes the air, into something called formate. Formate is useful because it can store hydrogen, which is a clean fuel that can power things like cars without making pollution. The scientists from Yale University and the University of Missouri worked together on this project. They hope this new method will help us use less fossil fuels and make the air cleaner. This is important because too much carbon dioxide in the air can harm the planet. By turning it into fuel, we can solve two problems at once: reduce pollution and create energy.",

    "This article is about a scientific discovery that helps fight air pollution. Carbon dioxide is a gas that comes from burning fossil fuels like coal and oil, and too much of it can warm the Earth and cause climate change. Scientists are looking for ways to use carbon dioxide instead of letting it harm the environment. They found that by using a catalyst made from manganese, they can turn carbon dioxide into formate, which is a chemical that can store hydrogen. Hydrogen is a clean fuel because when it is used, it only produces water, not pollution. This research is exciting because it uses cheap materials and could help make clean energy more affordable and better for the planet."
