  "title": "A British Family's Hard Time in an Iran Prison",
  "summary": "Lindsay and Craig Foreman are a British couple who were traveling around the world on motorcycles. In January 2025, they were passing through Iran when they were arrested and put in a prison called Evin. They were accused of spying, but they say they did not do anything wrong. Lindsay talked to the BBC from prison, saying it was very hard to stay happy and healthy there. She tried to exercise by running in circles in a small yard. Hours before they were sentenced to 10 years in prison, Lindsay sent a letter to complain about their treatment. Their son, Joe Bennett, is upset and wants the UK government to help bring them home. The UK Foreign Secretary, Yvette Cooper, called the sentence unfair. The family says no evidence was shown, and they were not allowed to defend themselves in court.",

    "This article is about a British couple, Lindsay and Craig Foreman, who were arrested in Iran while on a motorcycle trip around the world. They were accused of spying, which means secretly gathering information for another country, but they deny this. They were held in Evin prison, a known prison in Tehran, Iran. Lindsay spoke to the BBC from prison, describing how difficult it was to stay positive and healthy. Hours before they were sentenced to 10 years in prison, she sent a letter to complain. Their son and the UK government are trying to help them, saying the sentence is unfair and no evidence was shown. This shows how people can get into trouble in foreign countries, even when they think they are following the rules."
