  "summary": "In a significant upset at the Qatar Open, Jakub Mensik, a 20-year-old Czech tennis player ranked 16th in the world, defeated Jannik Sinner, the world number two, in the quarter-finals. The match lasted three sets, with Mensik winning 7-6 (7-3), 2-6, 6-3, ending Sinner's impressive run of 22 wins from 23 matches. Sinner, a 24-year-old Italian who had reached 10 finals in 2025 including victories at the Australian Open and Wimbledon, was unexpectedly knocked out in their first meeting. Mensik advances to the semi-finals to face unseeded Frenchman Arthur Fils, who defeated Jiri Lehecka. In other matches, world number one Carlos Alcaraz will play defending champion Andrey Rublev in the semi-finals, with Alcaraz extending his winning streak to 10 matches after winning the Australian Open. The doubles competition features British pairs, with top seeds Cash and Glasspool aiming to retain their title against compatriots Patten and Heliovaara. The tournament highlights competitive dynamics among top seeds, with several withdrawals in Dubai affecting the lineup.",
