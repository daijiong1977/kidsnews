  "title": "Fish See Themselves in Mirrors",
  "summary": "Scientists in Japan studied cleaner wrasse, small fish that live in coral reefs. They gave the fish mirrors to see what they would do. The fish looked at their reflections and tried to rub off marks that looked like parasites on their bodies. This showed they knew the reflection was themselves. Later, some fish picked up shrimp and dropped them near the mirror to watch how they fell in the reflection. This is called contingency testing, where they test how the mirror works. The study suggests these fish might be self-aware, meaning they understand themselves, which is a smart ability usually seen in animals like dolphins. This helps scientists learn more about animal intelligence and how different species think.",

    "Cleaner wrasse are small fish found in coral reefs, known for cleaning parasites off other fish. Scientists study animal intelligence to understand how different creatures think and learn. Mirrors are often used in experiments to see if animals recognize themselves, which can indicate self-awareness. Self-awareness means knowing you are a separate individual, and it's a sign of advanced thinking. This research helps us learn more about the minds of animals and how intelligence evolves in nature."
