  "title": "AI Helps Doctors Find Sick Blood Cells",
  "summary": "Scientists have created a new computer program called CytoDiffusion that uses artificial intelligence to look at blood cells under a microscope. It helps doctors find abnormal cells that might mean someone has a disease like leukemia. The AI studies the shape and structure of blood cells, which can be hard for humans to see because there are thousands of cells in a blood sample. It was trained on many pictures from a hospital and can spot rare or unusual cells better than people. This tool makes diagnoses more accurate and helps doctors not miss important signs. It also tells doctors when it is not sure, which helps avoid mistakes. The researchers from universities in London and Cambridge hope this will improve healthcare by making blood tests faster and more reliable.",

    "Blood cells are important for keeping us healthy. White blood cells fight infections, and red blood cells carry oxygen. Sometimes, cells can become abnormal, which might mean a disease like leukemia. Doctors use microscopes to look at blood samples, but it takes a long time and can be tricky to spot rare cells. Artificial intelligence is a type of computer technology that can learn from pictures and help with tasks like this, making it easier to find problems quickly."
