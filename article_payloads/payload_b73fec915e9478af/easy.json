  "title": "How Genes Help Make Brain Cells",
  "summary": "Scientists wanted to know how brain cells are made from special cells called embryonic stem cells. They used a tool called CRISPR to turn off nearly 20,000 genes one by one and see what happens. This helped them find 331 genes that are important for making brain cells. One gene, called PEDS1, was especially interesting because it helps make a fatty coating for nerve fibers. When PEDS1 doesn't work, brain size can be smaller, and children might have developmental delays. The study found two families where children with these problems had a rare change in the PEDS1 gene. This research helps doctors understand brain disorders better and could lead to new treatments in the future.",

    "Brain cells are made from special cells called embryonic stem cells during early development. Genes are like instructions in our cells that tell them what to do. Scientists use tools like CRISPR to study genes by turning them off. This helps them understand how brain cells form and what goes wrong in disorders like developmental delay, where kids might have trouble learning or growing."
