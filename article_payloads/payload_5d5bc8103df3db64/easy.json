  "title": "A Map Shows How Well Towns Fix Bumpy Roads",
  "summary": "In England, a new map helps drivers see how well their local towns are fixing potholes, which are holes in the roads. The government uses a traffic light system: red means the town is not doing well, amber means they are trying but need to do better, and green means they are doing a good job. Thirteen towns got a red rating, including Derbyshire, which had many potholes. Towns with red ratings will get extra money to help fix roads faster. The government gave £7.3 billion to fix roads over four years. Potholes can damage cars and cause accidents, costing drivers money for repairs. The map encourages towns to use money wisely to keep roads safe.",
