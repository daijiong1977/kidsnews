  "title": "A New Battery That Uses Calcium Instead of Lithium",
  "summary": "Scientists in Hong Kong have made an exciting new battery that uses calcium instead of lithium. Calcium is a common element found in things like chalk and milk, so it's easier to get than lithium. This new battery is called a calcium-ion battery. It can store energy from sources like solar and wind power, and it might be used in electric cars one day. The scientists used special materials called quasi-solid-state electrolytes to help the calcium ions move better inside the battery. This makes the battery work well for over 1,000 times of charging and discharging. It's a big step toward making batteries that are better for the environment and can help us use more clean energy.",
