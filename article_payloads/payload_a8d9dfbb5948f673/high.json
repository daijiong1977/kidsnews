  "title": "Breakthrough in Calcium-Ion Battery Technology: Quasi-Solid-State Electrolytes Enable High-Performance Energy Storage",
  "summary": "A research team from The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology has achieved a significant advancement in calcium-ion battery technology by developing quasi-solid-state electrolytes based on redox covalent organic frameworks. This innovation addresses critical limitations of lithium-ion batteries, including resource scarcity and energy density constraints, by leveraging calcium's abundance and comparable electrochemical window. The engineered electrolytes exhibit strong ionic conductivity (0.46 mS cm-1) and enhanced Ca2+ transport capability (>0.53) at room temperature, facilitated by aligned carbonyl groups within structured pores. Experimental results demonstrate a reversible specific capacity of 155.9 mAh g-1 at 0.15 A g-1 and capacity retention exceeding 74.6% after 1,000 cycles at 1 A g-1. Published in Advanced Science, this work underscores the potential of calcium-ion batteries as sustainable alternatives for applications such as grid-scale renewable energy storage and electric vehicles, contributing to a greener energy future through interdisciplinary collaboration between HKUST and Shanghai Jiao Tong University.",
