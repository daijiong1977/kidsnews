  "summary": "Researchers at The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology have developed a new calcium-ion battery design that enhances performance and sustainability. This innovation addresses the limitations of lithium-ion batteries, such as scarce lithium resources and energy density constraints. By incorporating quasi-solid-state electrolytes made from redox covalent organic frameworks, the team improved ionic conductivity and calcium ion transport. The battery achieved a reversible specific capacity of 155.9 mAh g-1 and retained over 74.6% capacity after 1,000 cycles at high current. This progress supports applications in renewable energy storage and electric vehicles, offering a promising alternative to lithium-based systems. The research, published in Advanced Science, involved collaboration with Shanghai Jiao Tong University and highlights the potential of calcium-ion technology for a greener future.",
