  "title": "Americans Worry About Government Checks and Balances",
  "summary": "A new poll shows that many Americans think the system of checks and balances in the U.S. government is not working well. This system helps keep power balanced between the President, Congress, and the courts. The poll found that two-thirds of people feel this way, which is a big increase from last year. People from all political groups, including Democrats, Republicans, and independents, have lost confidence. Recently, the Supreme Court made a decision against President Trump's tariffs, and he criticized the justices. This situation worries experts who study the law, as it shows people are concerned about how democracy is functioning.",

    "The U.S. government has three branches: the President (executive), Congress (legislative), and the courts (judicial). Checks and balances mean each branch can limit the others to prevent any one from becoming too powerful. For example, the Supreme Court can rule laws unconstitutional. This system is important for democracy to work fairly. In recent years, political disagreements have made some people doubt if it's still effective, as shown in polls and events like court decisions."
