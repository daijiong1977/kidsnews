  "title": "Declining Confidence in U.S. Checks and Balances Under Trump",
  "summary": "According to a recent PBS News/NPR/Marist Poll, two-thirds of Americans believe the system of checks and balances, which distributes power among the White House, Congress, and the courts, is not functioning effectively. This represents a significant 12-percentage-point increase from the previous year, with confidence dropping across all partisan lines: Democrats by 45 points, independents by 34 points, and Republicans by 19 points since December 2024. The poll was conducted shortly before the Supreme Court's 6-3 decision to strike down President Trump's sweeping tariffs on foreign goods, a key part of his economic policy. Following this ruling, Trump publicly criticized the justices, indicating tensions between branches. Constitutional law scholar Kimberly Wehle views this as a warning sign for American democracy, highlighting how public doubt has grown amid political conflicts and judicial actions. The article underscores a broader trend of eroding trust in governmental institutions, with implications for democratic stability and the balance of power.",

  "background_read": [
    "The U.S. Constitution establishes a system of checks and balances to prevent any branch of government—executive, legislative, or judicial—from dominating. This includes powers like presidential vetoes, congressional oversight, and judicial review. In recent years, political polarization has strained these mechanisms, with events such as Supreme Court decisions on policies like tariffs sparking public debate. Polls like the PBS News/NPR/Marist Poll measure public opinion on these issues, reflecting broader societal concerns about democratic health. Understanding these concepts helps analyze how trust in institutions can impact governance and stability."

  "Article_Structure": [
    "Main Points: The poll reveals a majority of Americans lack confidence in checks and balances, with declines across political parties; the Supreme Court's tariff ruling and Trump's response exemplify tensions. Purpose: To report on eroding public trust in governmental systems and highlight a specific instance of inter-branch conflict. Evidence Evaluation: The poll provides quantitative data from a reputable source, but it's a snapshot in time; the Supreme Court decision is a factual event, though the article lacks detailed methodology on the poll. Author Credibility: PBS NewsHour is a trusted news outlet, and references to experts like Kimberly Wehle add authority. Methodology: The article cites a poll conducted by PBS News/NPR/Marist, likely using standard surveying techniques, but doesn't specify sample size or margins of error."
