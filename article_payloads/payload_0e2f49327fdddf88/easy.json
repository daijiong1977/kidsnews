  "title": "Singer Helps Small Music Places",
  "summary": "A famous singer named Fender won a big prize called the Mercury Prize, which is worth £25,000. Instead of keeping the money for himself, he decided to give it all to the Music Venue Trust. This group helps small music venues, which are places where new bands and singers perform. These venues are important because they give artists a chance to share their music and grow. By donating the money, Fender is supporting these small spots so they can stay open and continue to host live music. This act shows kindness and helps keep music alive in communities. It's a great example of using success to help others.",
