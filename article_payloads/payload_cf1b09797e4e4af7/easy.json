  "title": "A Doctor in Trouble for Mean Posts",
  "summary": "A doctor named Dr. Asif Munaf, who was on a TV show called The Apprentice, is in big trouble. A medical group says he posted very bad things on social media. He shared antisemitic posts, which are mean comments about Jewish people, including denying the Holocaust and using hurtful symbols. He also posted racist and sexist things, like using a bad word for a boxer and saying some jobs should only be for men or women. The doctor did not go to the meeting about this and said his posts were not good for someone smart like him. He is also accused of leaving a hospital job without telling anyone and giving a sick note when he was not allowed to work. The hearing is still going on to decide what will happen.",
