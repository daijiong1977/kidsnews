  "title": "How Baby Turtles Find Their Way with a Hidden Sense",
  "summary": "Baby loggerhead turtles have a special hidden sense that helps them navigate the ocean. When they hatch from eggs on the beach, they start a long journey that can last for years. Scientists found that these turtles use their ability to feel the Earth's magnetic field to know where they are. This is like having a built-in map. They also have a compass sense to know which direction to go. Researchers did experiments by training turtles to dance for food in certain magnetic fields. Then, they used a strong magnetic pulse to see if the turtles could still dance. The turtles danced less, showing they rely on feeling the magnetic field to find their way. This helps them survive in the big ocean.",

    "Loggerhead turtles are sea turtles that live in oceans. When they are born, they have to travel long distances to find food and safe places. Scientists study how animals like turtles can sense the Earth's magnetic field, which is like an invisible map. This helps them understand how animals navigate without getting lost. In this article, researchers did fun experiments with baby turtles to see how they use this sense to survive in the big ocean."
