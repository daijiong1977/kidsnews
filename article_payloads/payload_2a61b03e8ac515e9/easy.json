  "title": "Treasury Stops Working with a Company After Tax Info Leak",
  "summary": "The U.S. Treasury Department has ended its contracts with a company called Booz Allen Hamilton. This happened because a former worker for that company leaked tax information about many rich people, including former President Donald Trump, to news outlets. The worker, Charles Edward Littlejohn, was sent to prison for five years for doing this. Treasury says the company did not do enough to protect the private tax data it had access to. Booz Allen Hamilton says it does not store taxpayer data on its own systems and helped the government catch the worker. The company still works with other government agencies like the Defense Department. This action is part of efforts by the Trump administration to punish those seen as enemies.",

    "This article is about a government decision related to privacy and security. In the U.S., the Treasury Department handles taxes and works with companies to do certain jobs. Sometimes, workers might share private information they shouldn't, which is called a leak. When this happens, the government can stop working with those companies to make sure data is safe. This case involves a former president's tax info, which is a big deal because it's supposed to be secret. Understanding this helps learn about government rules and why protecting private information is important."
