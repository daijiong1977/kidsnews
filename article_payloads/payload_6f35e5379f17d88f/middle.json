  "title": "New Evidence Shows Climate Variability During Snowball Earth",
  "summary": "A recent study challenges the long-held belief that Earth's climate was completely stagnant during the Snowball Earth period, approximately 720 to 635 million years ago. Researchers from the University of Southampton analyzed varves—layered sedimentary rocks—from the Garvellach Islands in Scotland, which date back to the Sturtian glaciation. These varves, with 2,600 individual layers each representing a year, revealed patterns of climate variability, including annual seasons, solar cycles, and oscillations similar to modern El Niño events. The findings suggest that even during this extreme ice age, the climate system continued to fluctuate on yearly to century-long timescales, likely due to partial ice-free ocean areas allowing atmosphere-ocean interactions. However, the researchers caution that this variability was probably short-lived and exceptional, with the overall state remaining cold and stable. This discovery provides insights into Earth's innate climate oscillations under severe conditions.",

    "The Snowball Earth hypothesis describes periods in Earth's history, particularly during the Cryogenian Period around 720 to 635 million years ago, when the planet was largely covered by ice sheets extending to the tropics. Scientists previously thought that this led to a shutdown of climate systems, with minimal variability. The new study focuses on the Sturtian glaciation, a key Snowball Earth event, using varves from Scotland to analyze annual climate records. Varves are sedimentary layers that form in calm waters, often due to seasonal changes, providing a high-resolution archive. This research builds on climate models showing that partial ice-free ocean areas could sustain oscillations, offering a nuanced view of Earth's resilience during extreme glaciations and informing our understanding of planetary climate dynamics."
