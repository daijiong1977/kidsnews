  "title": "Snowball Earth Was Not Totally Frozen",
  "summary": "Scientists have discovered that Earth was not completely frozen during a very cold time called Snowball Earth, which happened over 700 million years ago. They studied old rocks in Scotland that show layers from each year, like tree rings. These layers tell us that the climate still changed a little bit with seasons and other patterns, even when most of Earth was covered in ice. The researchers think this happened because some parts of the ocean might not have been frozen, allowing the air and water to interact. This helps us learn that Earth's climate can keep moving a bit, even in super cold times.",

    "Snowball Earth was a period over 700 million years ago when Earth got so cold that ice covered most of the planet, even near the equator. Scientists used to think everything was frozen and still, but new research shows there might have been small changes in climate. By looking at rocks with yearly layers, like in Scotland, they found clues that seasons and other patterns still happened. This teaches us that Earth's climate can be active even in extreme cold, helping us understand how our planet works."
