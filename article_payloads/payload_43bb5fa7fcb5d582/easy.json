  "title": "A Fun Tennis Match Between a Top Woman and a Top Man",
  "summary": "Aryna Sabalenka, the best women's tennis player, and Nick Kyrgios, a top men's player, are playing a special tennis match called a 'Battle of the Sexes' in Dubai on December 28. This match is an exhibition, which means it's for fun and not part of a regular tournament. It will be shown live on BBC One. Sabalenka is strong and has won big tournaments like the US Open. Kyrgios is also very good and played in the Wimbledon final. The match will have three sets, and if it's tied, they will play a tie-breaker. Organizers are making Sabalenka's side of the court a little smaller because women move a bit slower on average. People are excited and talking about this match because it's unusual to see a top woman play a top man in tennis.",

    "Tennis is a sport where players hit a ball over a net. There are men's and women's tournaments, but sometimes they play together in special matches. An exhibition match is for entertainment and not for winning a trophy. Dubai is a city known for hosting big sports events. BBC One is a British TV channel that shows sports and other programs."
