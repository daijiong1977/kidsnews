  "title": "Polar Bears Get Fatter in Norway",
  "summary": "Scientists found that polar bears on Svalbard islands in Norway are fatter and healthier now than in the 1990s, even though sea ice is melting due to climate change. Polar bears usually need sea ice to hunt seals for food, but these bears have adapted by eating other animals like reindeer and walruses. Researchers weighed 770 bears and saw they got fatter over time. Walruses are protected in Norway, so there are more of them for bears to hunt. Seals also gather in smaller ice areas, making them easier to catch. However, scientists warn this good news might not last because as ice keeps melting, bears will have to travel farther and use more energy, which could make them thinner again.",

    "Polar bears are large white bears that live in the Arctic, a very cold area near the North Pole. They depend on sea ice, which is frozen ocean water, to hunt seals for food. Climate change is making the Earth warmer, so sea ice is melting faster. In Svalbard, Norway, scientists have been studying polar bears for many years to see how they are affected. They found that bears are getting fatter by eating other animals like reindeer and walruses, but this might change if ice keeps melting."
