  "title": "Countries Join a Peace Board to Help Gaza",
  "summary": "More countries are being asked to join a new group called the Board of Peace, started by President Donald Trump of the United States. This board will help with rebuilding Gaza, a place that has been damaged by war. So far, at least seven more countries have said they got invitations, and two, Hungary and Vietnam, have agreed to join. The board will work on things like making sure there is peace, helping with security, and fixing buildings in Gaza. The United States plans to tell everyone which countries are on the board soon, maybe at a big meeting in Switzerland. The goal is to find new ways to solve problems around the world and help Gaza get better after the fighting.",
