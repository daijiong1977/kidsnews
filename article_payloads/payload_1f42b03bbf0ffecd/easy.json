  "title": "Hungary Blocks EU Loan to Ukraine Over Oil Dispute",
  "summary": "Hungary's foreign minister says his country will stop a big loan from the European Union to Ukraine. The loan is worth 90 billion euros and was meant to help Ukraine with its military and economy. Hungary is doing this because it wants Russian oil to flow again through a pipeline called Druzhba. The oil shipments stopped after a drone attack damaged the pipeline in Ukraine. Hungary and Slovakia, two countries in Europe, rely on this Russian oil and have accused Ukraine of not fixing the problem on purpose. They stopped sending diesel fuel to Ukraine this week. Hungary's leader, Viktor Orbán, often supports Russia and has argued that his country needs Russian energy to keep its economy strong. Many other European countries have reduced or stopped using Russian energy since the war started, but Hungary and Slovakia still use it. This decision comes just before the fourth anniversary of Russia's invasion of Ukraine.",

    "The European Union (EU) is a group of countries in Europe that work together on things like trade and laws. Ukraine is a country in Europe that is at war with Russia. Russia invaded Ukraine in 2022, and many countries have tried to help Ukraine by giving money or stopping trade with Russia. Hungary is a member of the EU but often disagrees with other countries about Russia. Oil is a natural resource used for energy, and pipelines help transport it across countries. This article talks about how Hungary is using its power in the EU to block help for Ukraine until it gets Russian oil again."
