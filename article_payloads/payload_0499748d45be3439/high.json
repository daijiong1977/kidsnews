  "title": "Mulatu Astatke's Culmination: Analyzing the Final Concert of an Ethio-Jazz Innovator",
  "summary": "Mulatu Astatke, renowned as the 'Godfather of Ethiopian jazz,' concluded his six-decade performing career with a final live concert in London, symbolizing the end of an era for Ethio-jazz. At 82, Astatke has been instrumental in developing this genre since the 1960s, conceptualizing it as a 'science' through the fusion of Ethiopian musical elements—such as the pentatonic scale and Orthodox church melodies—with diverse jazz traditions. His global recognition expanded significantly after his compositions were featured in the 2005 film Broken Flowers and the Oscar-nominated Nickel Boys, underscoring his cross-cultural appeal. The concert, set in a West End venue on a cold November evening, featured Astatke on the vibraphone, commencing with a 4th-century Ethiopian Orthodox tune to acknowledge his roots. Post-performance, Astatke offered limited commentary on his retirement, while US musician Dexter Story described the event as 'bittersweet,' highlighting the vibrant energy and the loss of a touring genius. This article explores Astatke's legacy, the artistic synthesis of Ethio-jazz, and the emotional resonance of his farewell.",
