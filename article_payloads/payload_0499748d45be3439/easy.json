  "summary": "Mulatu Astatke, an 82-year-old musician from Ethiopia, played his last live concert in London. He is known as the 'Godfather of Ethiopian jazz' because he mixed Ethiopian music with jazz from around the world to create a special style called Ethio-jazz. He has been performing for 60 years and became more famous after his music was used in movies like Broken Flowers. At the concert, he played the vibraphone, an instrument with metal bars, and started with a song from the Ethiopian Orthodox church. The audience was very happy to see him, and people felt sad that he won't tour anymore. Mulatu smiled and thanked his fans but didn't say much about how he felt.",
