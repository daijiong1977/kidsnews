  "title": "The Final Performance of Ethiopian Jazz Pioneer Mulatu Astatke",
  "summary": "Mulatu Astatke, an 82-year-old Ethiopian musician celebrated as the 'Godfather of Ethiopian jazz,' performed his last live concert in London, marking the end of a six-decade career. He pioneered Ethio-jazz by blending Ethiopian musical traditions, such as the pentatonic scale and Orthodox church tunes, with global jazz styles, creating a unique sound he describes as a 'science.' His international recognition grew after his music featured in the 2005 film Broken Flowers and the Oscar-nominated Nickel Boys. At the concert, held on a cold November evening, Mulatu played the vibraphone, starting with a 4th-century Ethiopian Orthodox song to honor his heritage. The audience, including US musician Dexter Story, expressed bittersweet emotions, celebrating his vibrant performance while mourning the end of his tours. Mulatu remained reserved about his feelings post-concert, focusing on the music's legacy.",
