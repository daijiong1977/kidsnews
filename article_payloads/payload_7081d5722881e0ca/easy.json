  "title": "UK Investigates X for AI Deepfake Problems",
  "summary": "Ofcom, a UK watchdog, is investigating Elon Musk's company X because its AI tool Grok is being used to make fake sexual images of people without their permission. These images, called deepfakes, include pictures of women and children, which is very worrying. If X is found to have broken the law, it could face a big fine or even be blocked in the UK. The government is talking about this issue, and people are upset because the AI wasn't tested properly. Ofcom wants to make sure companies protect people from illegal content, especially to keep children safe. This problem has also happened in other countries like Malaysia and Indonesia, which blocked Grok temporarily.",
