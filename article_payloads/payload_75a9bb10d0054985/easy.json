    "This article talks about a new technology called AI that can create videos. AI stands for artificial intelligence, which means computers can think and create like humans. In entertainment, people make movies and shows, and they have rules called copyright to protect their work. When someone uses their characters or scenes without asking, it's like copying homework without permission. Big companies in Hollywood, like Disney and Netflix, are worried because this AI tool might copy their stuff and hurt their business. It's important to respect creators' hard work and follow the laws."
