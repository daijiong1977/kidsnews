  "title": "Hollywood Studios Challenge AI Video Tool Over Copyright Issues",
  "summary": "Seedance 2.0, an advanced AI video tool developed by ByteDance, TikTok's parent company, has sparked controversy by generating ultra-realistic clips from simple text prompts. Users have created videos featuring celebrities like Tom Cruise and Brad Pitt or reimagining popular shows such as Friends, often without authorization. Hollywood studios, represented by the Motion Picture Association (MPA), have issued a strong demand for ByteDance to cease infringing on copyrights, arguing that the tool operates without adequate safeguards. The MPA claims this massive-scale unauthorized use threatens creators' rights and American jobs. In response, ByteDance states it respects intellectual property, has suspended user uploads of real people's images, and is implementing measures to comply with regulations. Meanwhile, industry professionals like Deadpool writer Rhett Reese express fear that such AI could endanger careers by producing professional-quality content effortlessly, highlighting a tension between technological innovation and creative protection.",
