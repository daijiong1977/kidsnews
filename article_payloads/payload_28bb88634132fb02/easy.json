  "title": "A Giant Planet Found with a Special Telescope",
  "summary": "Astronomers used the Subaru Telescope in Hawaii to find two hidden objects in space: a giant planet and a brown dwarf. These are like big planets or small stars that are hard to see because they are very dim next to bright stars. The project called OASIS helps by using data from space missions to find stars that might have these objects. Then, the telescope takes sharp pictures to see them. One planet, HIP 54515 b, is 18 times bigger than Jupiter and orbits a star far away. The brown dwarf, HIP 71618 B, is 60 times bigger than Jupiter and will help test NASA's new Roman Space Telescope. This teamwork between space and ground telescopes helps scientists discover more hidden worlds.",

    "Astronomy is the study of stars, planets, and other objects in space. Telescopes like the Subaru Telescope help scientists see faraway things. Planets are big balls that orbit stars, and brown dwarfs are objects that are like small stars but don't shine brightly. NASA is a space agency that builds telescopes to explore space. This article talks about how scientists work together to find new objects that are hard to see."
