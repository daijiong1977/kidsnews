  "title": "Rocket News: China's Rockets Have Problems, Rocket Lab Faces Delay",
  "summary": "This article talks about rockets and space news from around the world. In China, two rockets failed in just 12 hours, which means they didn't work as planned. Rocket Lab, a company from New Zealand, had a setback with its new Neutron rocket during a test, so it might take longer to launch. In Australia, a company called Gilmour Space got a lot of money to build rockets, helping Australia join the space race. In Europe, a German company named Isar Aerospace delayed its rocket launch to fix a valve issue, and a UK company called Orbex might be sold to another European company. The article shows that many countries are trying to build their own rockets to launch satellites without relying on others like SpaceX.",

    "Space exploration involves sending rockets into space to launch satellites for things like TV, GPS, and weather tracking. Many countries and companies are building their own rockets to be independent and not rely on others. Rockets can sometimes fail during tests or launches, which is common in the space industry as scientists learn and improve. This article discusses recent events in rocket development around the world, showing how different places are working on their space programs."
