He defended a U.S. military operation that captured Venezuela's leader, Nicolás Maduro, last month. Rubio said that Venezuela is better off now because conditions have improved since Maduro was removed. Some Caribbean leaders had concerns about the operation, but Rubio explained that the U.S. wants to work with them on issues like crime and the economy. He mentioned that the U.S. is focusing more on the Western Hemisphere after ignoring it for a long time. Rubio also talked about criminal groups in the Caribbean and how they get weapons from the U.S., which authorities are trying to stop.",
