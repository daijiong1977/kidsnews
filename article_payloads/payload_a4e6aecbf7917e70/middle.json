    "Online scams involving celebrity impersonation are common, where fraudsters create fake profiles to exploit fans' admiration. These scams often use social engineering to build trust and request money for fake emergencies or opportunities. It's crucial to understand that celebrities rarely interact personally with fans on social media. Always verify accounts through official channels, use strong privacy settings, and report suspicious activity. Educating oneself about digital literacy can reduce vulnerability to such crimes."
