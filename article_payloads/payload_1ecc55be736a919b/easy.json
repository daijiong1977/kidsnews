  "title": "Sarah Ferguson Asked a Bad Man for Money Help",
  "summary": "Sarah Ferguson, who used to be a duchess, had a big money problem with £6 million in debt. She asked Jeffrey Epstein for advice on how to fix it, even though he was in jail for a bad crime. Emails show she felt very sad and tired, saying 'death is easier than this.' She got an offer from a rich man named John Caudwell to give her £10 million, but he wanted half her future money forever. Epstein told her to get the deal in writing. The emails also show Epstein and his friend talked about her in a mean way, like she was a cheating girlfriend. This story teaches us about being careful with money and who we ask for help.",
