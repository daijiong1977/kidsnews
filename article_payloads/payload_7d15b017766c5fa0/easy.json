  "title": "Survivors Feel Worried About Epstein Files Release",
  "summary": "The US government released some documents about Jeffrey Epstein, a man who hurt many people. Survivors, like Liz Stein and Marina Lacerda, are nervous because not all files are out yet, and many parts are hidden with black marks called redactions. They want all the evidence to be public so everyone can see what happened. The law says all documents must be released, but the government is not doing it fully. Some photos in the files show famous people, but being in the photos does not mean they did anything wrong. Survivors are disappointed and worried that the government is not being honest.",

    "Jeffrey Epstein was a wealthy man who abused many young people, and after he died, the US government promised to release all documents about his crimes. Survivors are people who were hurt by him and want justice by having all information made public. Redactions are when parts of documents are hidden, which can make it hard to understand the full story. The law called the Epstein Files Transparency Act says all files must be released, but the government has not done this completely, causing worry and distrust among survivors."
