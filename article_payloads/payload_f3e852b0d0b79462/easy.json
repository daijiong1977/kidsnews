  "title": "Why Businesses Must Help Nature to Survive",
  "summary": "A big report from scientists says businesses need to protect nature or they might go extinct. Nature gives us free things like clean water and good soil, which all companies use. If businesses harm nature, they could hurt themselves too. For example, at Steart Marshes in Somerset, farmers and conservationists work together. Cows graze to help birds and insects, and this also makes good beef. Restoring nature can also protect villages from floods and clean the air. The report says businesses should change from hurting nature to helping it, using clear tools to measure their impact. This is important because losing plants and animals is a big threat to businesses, and it's now a must-do, not just a nice thing.",
