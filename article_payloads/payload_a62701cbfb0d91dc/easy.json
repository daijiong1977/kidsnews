  "title": "Iceland Says No to Eurovision Song Contest",
  "summary": "Iceland has decided not to join the Eurovision Song Contest in 2026, making it the fifth country to do so after Spain, Ireland, Slovenia, and the Netherlands. They are boycotting because Israel is allowed to participate in the competition. The director of Iceland's national broadcaster, RÚV, said there is no peace or joy in the contest right now, so they are stepping back. RÚV also mentioned that Israel's involvement has caused disagreements among members of the European Broadcasting Union and the public. Iceland made this decision just before the deadline to confirm participation. Eurovision's director respects their choice and hopes they return soon. The contest is supposed to celebrate its 70th anniversary, but some countries are unhappy with Israel being there due to the war in Gaza and voting concerns.",

    "Eurovision is a popular song contest where countries in Europe compete every year. It started in 1956 and is known for fun music and colorful performances. Countries send singers to represent them, and people vote for their favorites. Sometimes, political issues can affect the contest, like when countries disagree about who should participate. In 2026, it will be the 70th anniversary, but some countries are choosing not to join because they are upset about Israel being involved due to the war in Gaza. This shows how events in the world can impact entertainment and celebrations."
