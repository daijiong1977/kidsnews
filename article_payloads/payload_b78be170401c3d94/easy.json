  "summary": "Cate Blanchett, who is a famous actress, and other important people like a former prime minister and an inventor are going to be guest editors for BBC Radio 4's Today programme during Christmas. This means they get to choose what stories to talk about on the radio. They will have their own shows from December 24 to 31. Each person will share interesting topics. For example, Cate will talk about how computers affect women in movies and why gardening is fun. Others will discuss stories about health, running, and helping people. The radio editor says this brings new ideas and joy to listeners every year. It's a special tradition that has been happening for 22 years.",
