  "title": "A Hidden Star and Hot Dust Mystery",
  "summary": "Scientists found a hidden star near another star called Kappa Tucanae A, about 70 light-years from Earth. This star has hot dust around it that glows brightly and should not exist because the heat and light from the star should destroy it quickly. Researchers from the University of Arizona used special telescopes to discover a companion star that moves close to the main star. This companion star might be helping the dust survive by passing through the same area. This discovery is important because hot dust like this can make it hard for scientists to find Earth-like planets around other stars. By studying this star system, scientists can learn more about how dust behaves in space and improve their search for new planets.",
