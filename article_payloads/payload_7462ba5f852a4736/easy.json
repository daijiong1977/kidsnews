  "title": "Sydney Sweeney Wants Movies to Help People",
  "summary": "Sydney Sweeney is an actor who wants to make movies that can help and save people's lives. She is in two new films this year: The Housemaid and Christy. Both movies talk about domestic violence, which is when someone hurts their family at home. Sydney says this topic is common and she is careful when acting in these roles. She thinks it's important for big movies to discuss hard topics. In The Housemaid, she plays Millie, a character who works in a house. The movie is based on a popular book that many people like on TikTok. Sydney loves the book and the story. She works with other actors like Amanda Seyfried, who plays Nina. Amanda says they look alike and think similarly, which makes it fun to work together. The movie shows Nina dealing with mental health issues, which can be tough to watch but needs to be realistic. The Housemaid is like old thrillers but has a modern story about abuse.",
