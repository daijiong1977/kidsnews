  "title": "Sydney Sweeney's Mission: Films with Social Impact",
  "summary": "Sydney Sweeney, a 28-year-old American actor, aims to create films that significantly impact and potentially save lives, as she discussed with the BBC. This year, she has taken on roles in two films addressing domestic violence: The Housemaid, a psychological thriller, and Christy, a boxing biopic. Sweeney emphasizes the prevalence of domestic violence and approaches these roles with great care, believing it's crucial for commercial films to tackle such challenging subjects. In The Housemaid, based on Freida McFadden's 2022 bestselling novel popular on TikTok, she portrays Millie Calloway, a character employed in a household. Sweeney expresses enthusiasm for the complex narrative, describing it as a dream project. The film co-stars Amanda Seyfried as Nina Winchester, who deals with mental health issues, adding depth to the story. Seyfried notes their physical and ideological similarities enhance their collaboration, allowing them to explore characters deeply. The Housemaid draws comparisons to 1990s domestic thrillers but incorporates modern elements focusing on physical and mental abuse, aiming to reflect real-life struggles realistically. Sweeney's commitment to meaningful storytelling highlights her desire to use cinema as a tool for social change and awareness.",
