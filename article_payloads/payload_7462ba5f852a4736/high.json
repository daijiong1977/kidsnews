  "title": "Cinematic Advocacy: Sydney Sweeney's Pursuit of Life-Saving Narratives",
  "summary": "In an interview with the BBC, Sydney Sweeney articulates her ambition to produce films that exert a profound impact and potentially save lives, underscoring her commitment to socially conscious cinema. At 28, the American actor has recently featured in two films centered on domestic violence: The Housemaid, a psychological thriller adapted from Freida McFadden's 2022 international bestseller, and Christy, a boxing biopic. Sweeney describes domestic violence as a prevalent issue and emphasizes meticulous care in her portrayals, advocating for the importance of commercial films addressing arduous topics. In The Housemaid, she embodies Millie Calloway, a character navigating a household fraught with tension, based on a novel that garnered a substantial following on TikTok, illustrating contemporary literary engagement. Sweeney expresses admiration for the narrative's complexity, deeming it a dream project. The film co-stars Amanda Seyfried as Nina Winchester, a role grappling with mental health issues, which Seyfried approaches with realism to mirror actual experiences. Seyfried highlights an uncanny similarity with Sweeney, both physically and ideologically, fostering a dynamic collaboration that enriches character exploration. The Housemaid is contextualized within the legacy of 1990s domestic thrillers but is distinguished by its modern focus on physical and psychological abuse, aiming to authentically depict real-world struggles. Sweeney's endeavors reflect a strategic use of mainstream media to catalyze social change, blending entertainment with advocacy to foster awareness and empathy regarding critical societal issues.",
