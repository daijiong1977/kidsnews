  "title": "Scientists Find the Enzyme That Helps Cancer Change Its DNA Fast",
  "summary": "Scientists have discovered an enzyme called N4BP2 that causes a big change in cancer cells. This change, called chromothripsis, happens when a chromosome breaks into many pieces and gets put back together in the wrong order. It lets cancer cells evolve quickly and become resistant to treatments. Chromothripsis is common in many cancers, like bone and brain cancers. The enzyme works by entering small compartments called micronuclei and cutting the DNA inside. By finding this enzyme, scientists hope to develop new ways to treat aggressive cancers by stopping this process.",

    "Cancer is a disease where cells grow uncontrollably and can harm the body. Chromosomes are structures in cells that hold DNA, which gives instructions for how cells work. Sometimes, chromosomes can break and get mixed up, which is called chromothripsis. This helps cancer cells change and resist medicines. Scientists study enzymes like N4BP2 to understand how to stop this and help people with cancer."
