  "title": "Local Council Elections Delayed for Many People",
  "summary": "In England, many local council elections that were supposed to happen in May are being delayed. More than 2.5 million voters will be affected because their councils asked to postpone the votes. The government is changing how local councils work, and 23 councils want to wait until 2027 to hold elections. This helps them focus on the big changes without the distraction of voting. Most of these councils are led by the Labour party, but some are run by other parties or independents. Ministers are likely to approve these delays soon. The changes will create new councils that handle all services, replacing old systems. Critics say Labour is afraid of voters, but the government says it saves money and time.",

    "Local councils are groups that help run towns and cities in England, making decisions about things like schools and parks. Elections let people vote for council members. The government is reorganizing councils to make them simpler, which is a big change. Delaying elections means voters have to wait longer to choose their leaders, but it helps councils focus on the changes. Some people think this is because politicians are scared of losing votes."
