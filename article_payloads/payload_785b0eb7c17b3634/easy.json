  "title": "A Big Winter Storm is Coming to the U.S.",
  "summary": "A big winter storm is coming to the United States, and it might bring a lot of snow, ice, and very cold weather. Forecasters say that over half of all people in the U.S. could be affected by this storm. The storm will start in Texas and Oklahoma on Friday, then move to the South with freezing rain and sleet. Later, it will go to the Northeast, where places like Washington, D.C., New York, and Boston might get about a foot of snow. The National Weather Service is watching the storm and has a live map that shows where snow might fall over the next three days. People should be careful and stay warm because the storm could cause damage like a hurricane.",
