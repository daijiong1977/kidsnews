  "title": "Sugary Drinks and Teen Worries",
  "summary": "A new study found that teenagers who drink lots of sugary drinks, like soda and juice, might feel more anxious or worried. Researchers looked at many studies to see if there is a link between what teens drink and how they feel. They discovered that teens who drink more sugary drinks often report more anxiety symptoms. The scientists say this doesn't mean sugary drinks cause anxiety, but there is a connection. They think it's important to study this more because many teens have anxiety, and changing habits like drinking less sugar could help them feel better. The study was done by experts from Bournemouth University and published in a science journal.",
