  "title": "Asos Co-Founder's Death in Thailand Under Investigation",
  "summary": "Quentin Griffiths, a British co-founder of the online fashion retailer Asos, died after falling from a high-rise apartment block in Pattaya, Thailand, on February 9th. Thai police reported that he was found dead outside a luxury hotel where he resided as a long-term resident in a 17th-floor suite. Initial investigations revealed his room was locked from the inside with no evidence of break-ins, and an autopsy indicated no foul play, suggesting the death may have been accidental. Griffiths co-founded Asos in London in 2000 with others, leaving the company in 2005 but remaining a significant shareholder. Asos, originally named As Seen On Screen, grew from selling celebrity-inspired fashion to a major online marketplace valued over £6 billion. Police noted Griffiths was involved in ongoing court cases, including a legal dispute with his Thai ex-wife over a shared business, which could have contributed to stress. The article highlights his background, the company's evolution, and the circumstances of his death, with additional context on Asos's current shareholders like Anders Holch Povlsen and Mike Ashley.",
