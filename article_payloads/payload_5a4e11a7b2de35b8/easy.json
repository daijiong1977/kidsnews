  "title": "A Founder of Asos Dies in Thailand",
  "summary": "Quentin Griffiths, who helped start the online fashion company Asos, died after falling from a tall building in Thailand. Police say he was found outside a hotel in Pattaya on February 9th. They checked his room and found it locked from the inside with no signs of a break-in. An autopsy showed no evidence of foul play, meaning it might have been an accident. Griffiths was a British man who lived in a suite on the 17th floor. He left Asos years ago but still owned part of the company. Asos sells clothes inspired by TV and movie stars and has grown into a big business. Police mentioned he had some legal problems that could have made him stressed. This is a sad story about a person who helped create a famous fashion brand.",

    "Asos is an online fashion store that began in 2000. It sells clothes that look like what celebrities wear on TV and in movies. The company has grown very big and is worth billions of pounds. Founders are people who create companies, and they often own parts of them even after leaving. Thailand is a country in Southeast Asia known for its beaches and cities like Pattaya. Police investigate deaths to understand what happened, and autopsies help them learn more. Stress can come from problems like legal disputes, which are arguments in court."
