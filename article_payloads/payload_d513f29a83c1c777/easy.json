  "title": "Government Data Stolen in a Hack",
  "summary": "Government data was stolen in a hack, but officials say the risk to people is low. The data was on systems run by the Foreign Office for the Home Office. A group linked to China is suspected of doing the hack. The government is still investigating and closed the security gap quickly. They think it's unlikely that individuals were affected. The Information Commissioner's Office has been told about it. This hack could be awkward because the UK prime minister plans to visit China next year. The government says it's important to talk to China about trade and climate change, even though there are security concerns.",

    "This article is about a cyber attack where government data was stolen. Hackers broke into computer systems, and officials think a group connected to China might be responsible. They are checking to see what happened and say it probably didn't harm regular people. The government is still talking to China about important things like trade, even though this hack makes things tricky. It shows how countries need to protect their computers from attacks."
