  "title": "James Webb Telescope Finds Tiny Space Chemicals in a Dusty Galaxy",
  "summary": "Scientists used the James Webb Space Telescope to look inside a very dusty galaxy called IRAS 07251-0248. This galaxy is hard to see because it has lots of gas and dust hiding its center. The telescope uses infrared light to see through the dust. It found many small organic molecules like benzene and methane deep in the galaxy's core. These molecules are not alive, but they are important because they could help make bigger chemicals needed for life. The study suggests that cosmic rays, which are high-energy particles from space, might be breaking apart bigger carbon pieces to create these small molecules. This discovery helps us understand how chemicals form in extreme places in space and shows how powerful the James Webb Telescope is.",

    "Space is full of galaxies, which are big groups of stars, gas, and dust. Some galaxies, like IRAS 07251-0248, have lots of dust that hides their centers. Scientists use special telescopes like the James Webb Space Telescope to see through this dust. They look for chemicals called organic molecules, which are made of carbon and could be building blocks for life. Cosmic rays are high-energy particles that travel through space and can break things apart, possibly helping to form these molecules. This study helps us learn how chemicals form in extreme places far away."
