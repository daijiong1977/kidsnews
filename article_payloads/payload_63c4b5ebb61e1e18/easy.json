  "title": "Understanding Menopause Medicine Warnings",
  "summary": "The FDA removed strong safety warnings from menopause hormone drugs after 20 years. These warnings were added in 2003 because a study suggested the medicines could raise the risk of breast cancer, stroke, and heart attack. But now, doctors say the drugs are safer, especially for women under 60, because newer studies used better methods. Hormone therapy helps with symptoms like hot flashes and mood swings by adding back hormones like estrogen. There are two types: local therapy for vaginal issues with low risk, and systemic therapy for whole-body effects with more risk. Doctors advise talking to them to choose the right treatment.",

    "Menopause is a normal part of aging for women, usually starting in their 40s or 50s, when the body makes fewer hormones. This can cause uncomfortable symptoms like hot flashes and mood changes. Hormone therapy uses medicines to add back these hormones and help women feel better. The FDA is a group that checks if medicines are safe for people to use. Over time, scientists learn more about medicines, so warnings can change to reflect new knowledge."
