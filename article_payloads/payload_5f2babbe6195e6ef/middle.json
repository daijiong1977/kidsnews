  "title": "The Shift from Women-Led Stories to Male-Dominated Action in Bollywood",
  "summary": "In 2025, Bollywood experienced a significant shift as violent, male-driven action thrillers dominated the box-office and cultural discussions, contrasting sharply with 2024 when women-led films gained global acclaim. Films like Dhurandhar, an espionage thriller set against India-Pakistan tensions, became major hits, emphasizing hypermasculine themes. The top 10 box-office hits were largely male-centric, including historical epics like Chhaava and action spectacles like War 2, with only Lokah, a Malayalam superhero film, featuring a female lead. This trend extended beyond action to romances like Saiyaara and mythical spectacles, which reinforced traditional male heroism. Critics note that 2024 offered a glimpse of potential with films by Payal Kapadia and others, but 2025 reverted to Bollywood's long-standing fixation on macho heroes, reminiscent of Amitabh Bachchan's 'angry young man' era. Experts argue that one year of progress is insufficient to address historical inequalities in casting and opportunities for women, highlighting the need for sustained efforts to diversify storytelling in Indian cinema.",

    "Bollywood, India's Hindi film industry, has a complex history of gender representation. In 2024, films like All We Imagine As Light by Payal Kapadia and Girls Will Be Girls by Shuchi Talati received international praise, highlighting women's voices and challenging traditional narratives. This period raised hopes for increased diversity in storytelling. However, 2025 saw a resurgence of hypermasculine themes, with movies such as Dhurandhar and War 2 dominating box-office charts. This trend reflects Bollywood's enduring legacy of male-centric stories, dating back to the 1970s with Amitabh Bachchan's iconic roles. Experts like Priyanka Basu point out systemic inequalities in casting and opportunities, suggesting that sustained effort is needed to achieve meaningful change. Understanding this context helps analyze the cyclical nature of film trends and the ongoing struggle for gender equity in cinema."
