  "title": "Analyzing the Resurgence of Hypermasculinity in Bollywood: A Comparative Study of 2024-2025 Trends",
  "summary": "The article examines a pivotal shift in Bollywood from 2024 to 2025, where the industry reverted to hypermasculine, male-driven narratives after a brief period of acclaim for women-led cinema. In 2024, films such as Payal Kapadia's All We Imagine As Light and Kiran Rao's Laapataa Ladies garnered global recognition, positioning Indian women filmmakers as influential voices. However, 2025 witnessed the dominance of aggressive action thrillers like Dhurandhar, which capitalized on India-Pakistan tensions, and other hits such as Chhaava and War 2, all reinforcing traditional male heroism. The top 10 box-office hits were predominantly male-centric, with Lokah as the sole female-led exception, underscoring persistent gender disparities. This trend extended to genres like romance and mythology, with films like Tere Ishk Mein romanticizing toxic masculinity despite criticism. Experts, including film critic Mayank Shekhar and academic Priyanka Basu, contextualize this within Bollywood's historical fixation on macho heroes, tracing it to Amitabh Bachchan's 'angry young man' archetype. The analysis highlights the cyclical nature of cinematic trends, the economic drivers behind box-office success, and the structural inequalities in casting and opportunities that hinder sustained progress for gender diversity in Indian cinema.",

    "Bollywood, as a major cultural force in India, has historically grappled with gender representation, often prioritizing male-centric stories rooted in traditional hero archetypes. The period from 2024 to 2025 serves as a microcosm of this dynamic: 2024 saw breakthroughs with films like All We Imagine As Light, which won accolades at Cannes, and Laapataa Ladies, highlighting nuanced female narratives. This challenged the industry's norms and sparked debates on inclusivity. In contrast, 2025's resurgence of hypermasculine films, such as Dhurandhar and Tere Ishq Mein, reflects economic pressures and audience preferences for spectacle-driven content. Scholars like Priyanka Basu link this to deeper structural issues, including pay gaps and limited opportunities for women in directing and leading roles. Understanding this context requires examining Bollywood's evolution from the 1970s 'angry young man' trope to contemporary global influences, as well as the role of media criticism in shaping public discourse. This background enriches the analysis of cyclical trends and the persistent challenges in achieving gender equity in cinema."

    "Main Points: The article analyzes Bollywood's regression to hypermasculine narratives in 2025 after 2024's progress with women-led films, highlighting specific hits like Dhurandhar and Tere Ishk Mein, and discussing economic and cultural drivers. Purpose: To critically assess gender representation trends in Indian cinema, exploring the tension between momentary advancements and entrenched inequalities.

Methodology: Employs qualitative methods, including analysis of box-office data, social media discourse, and interviews with critics and academics, offering a narrative-driven approach. Critical Assessment: Strengths include timely analysis and contextual depth, but limitations involve reliance on selective examples and insufficient exploration of alternative cinematic movements or regional industries beyond Bollywood."
