  "title": "Angry Men Take Over Bollywood Movies in 2025",
  "summary": "In 2025, Bollywood movies in India were mostly about angry and strong men. The year before, in 2024, many movies made by women got a lot of praise around the world. But in 2025, popular films like Dhurandhar, Chhaava, and War 2 focused on male heroes who were violent and powerful. These movies made a lot of money and people talked about them a lot. Only one movie in the top 10, called Lokah, had a woman as the main character. Experts say that movies have often centered on men for a long time, and it will take more years to see more stories about women. This shows how Bollywood changes from year to year.",
