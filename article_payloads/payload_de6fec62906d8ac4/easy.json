  "title": "A Tiny Germ Breaks a Big Rule of Life",
  "summary": "Scientists found a tiny living thing called a microbe that breaks a rule about how life works. All living things use DNA to make proteins, which are like tiny machines that do jobs in cells. DNA has instructions made of three-letter codes called codons. Usually, each codon tells the cell to add one specific part, called an amino acid, to build a protein, or it says 'stop' to finish the protein. But this microbe, named Methanosarcina acetivorans, sometimes ignores the 'stop' signal and adds an amino acid instead, making two different proteins from the same instruction. This shows that life can be a little messy and still work fine. The microbe is part of a group called Archaea and makes methane. Scientists think this trick helps it use a special amino acid to eat a chemical called methylamine, which is found in places like our guts. This discovery might help people with some diseases caused by 'stop' signals that come too early.",

    "DNA is like a recipe book for living things, with codons as instructions to build proteins. Proteins are important molecules that do jobs in cells, such as helping us grow or fight germs. Usually, each codon has one clear meaning, like 'add this amino acid' or 'stop building.' Scientists thought all life followed this rule strictly, but this microbe shows it can be flexible. This might help us understand how life evolved and find new ways to treat diseases where proteins don't form correctly."
