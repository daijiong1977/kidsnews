  "title": "How ADHD Traits in Kids Can Affect Health When They Grow Up",
  "summary": "A study from University College London and the University of Liverpool found that children who show ADHD traits at age 10 are more likely to have health problems by age 46. ADHD stands for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, which can make it hard for people to pay attention, control impulses, or sit still. The researchers looked at data from over 10,000 people in the UK who were followed from birth to middle age. They discovered that kids with more ADHD traits had higher chances of getting conditions like migraines, back issues, or diabetes later in life. This happens because ADHD can make daily tasks like planning and time management difficult, leading to stress and health risks over time. The study shows that people with ADHD need better support to stay healthy as they grow older.",

    "ADHD is a common condition that affects how people think and act. It often starts in childhood and can last into adulthood. Kids with ADHD might have trouble focusing in school or controlling their impulses. This study shows that if not supported, these challenges can lead to health issues like pain or sickness later in life. Understanding ADHD helps us provide better care and support for those affected."
