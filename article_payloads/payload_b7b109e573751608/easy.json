  "summary": "Blake Lively and Justin Baldoni are actors who worked together on a movie called It Ends With Us. They are now in a big argument in court. Blake says Justin did bad things to her, like sexual harassment, and Justin says that is not true. New messages from Blake show she called Justin names like 'clown' and 'doofus director' in texts to her friends. She also said she felt sorry for him even though he was mean to her. The messages are part of a lawsuit, and the case will go to trial in May. Both sides have different stories, and the court will decide what really happened.",
