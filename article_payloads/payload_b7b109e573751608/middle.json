  "title": "Legal Battle Between Blake Lively and Justin Baldoni Over Harassment Claims",
  "summary": "Actors Blake Lively and Justin Baldoni, who co-starred in the film It Ends With Us, are embroiled in a contentious legal dispute. Lively filed a lawsuit in December 2024, accusing Baldoni of sexual harassment and orchestrating a smear campaign against her. Baldoni has vehemently denied these allegations and is contesting the case. Recently unsealed court documents reveal text messages from 2023 in which Lively referred to Baldoni as a 'doofus director' and a 'clown,' and described him as behaving like a 'rabid pig.' These messages, exchanged with friends like Taylor Swift and Liz Plank, show Lively expressing frustration over Baldoni's actions while also indicating sympathy for him. The documents highlight tensions during the film's production and press tour, with Lively claiming she worked to improve the movie despite Baldoni's behavior. Baldoni's $400 million counter-suit was dismissed in June, and the trial is scheduled for May. Both parties have not commented publicly, and the case underscores the complexities of celebrity conflicts and legal proceedings in the entertainment industry.",
