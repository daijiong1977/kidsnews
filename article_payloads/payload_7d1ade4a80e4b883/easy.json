  "title": "Scientists Find New Signals in Alaska That Could Help Warn of Tsunamis",
  "summary": "Scientists in Alaska are studying a big landslide near a glacier to keep people safe from tsunamis. They put special instruments around the Barry Landslide in Prince William Sound to listen for tiny shakes in the ground. They found new signals that happen when water freezes and thaws inside cracks in the rock under the Cascade Glacier. These signals are not from the landslide moving, but they help scientists understand how water changes underground, which might affect the slope later. The landslide is very large and could fall into the water, making a big wave called a tsunami. This could be dangerous for kayakers, cruise ships, and nearby towns like Whittier. By learning about these signals, scientists hope to give early warnings to protect everyone.",

    "In Alaska, there is a place called Prince William Sound with a big landslide near a glacier. Scientists are worried because if the landslide falls into the water, it could create a giant wave called a tsunami. They use special tools to listen for tiny shakes in the ground to learn more and help warn people before it happens. This is important to protect kayakers, ships, and towns nearby."
