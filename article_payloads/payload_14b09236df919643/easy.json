  "title": "Judge Stops Case Against Comedian Reginald D Hunter",
  "summary": "A judge has stopped a case against comedian Reginald D Hunter. The case was brought by a group called the Campaign Against Antisemitism (CAA), who said Hunter sent mean messages online. The judge, Michael Snow, said the CAA was not being honest and wanted to use the court to get Hunter 'cancelled', which means to make people stop liking or hiring him. Hunter is a funny person on TV shows. He thanked his lawyers and hoped he could work again. The judge found that the CAA did not tell the whole story about the messages and hid information. This shows that the court system should be used fairly, not for bad reasons.",
