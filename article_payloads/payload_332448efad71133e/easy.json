  "title": "Running Very Long Races Can Hurt Your Blood Cells",
  "summary": "Running very long races, called ultramarathons, might hurt your red blood cells. Red blood cells are tiny parts in your blood that carry oxygen all over your body. A new study found that after people run these long races, their red blood cells become less bendy. This is a problem because red blood cells need to bend to squeeze through small blood vessels. If they can't bend well, they might not work as good at giving oxygen to your muscles and organs. Scientists studied runners in two races: one 25 miles long and one 106 miles long. They took blood samples before and after the races. The results showed that the longer the race, the more the red blood cells got hurt. The scientists don't know how long this damage lasts or if it's bad for health in the long run. They say more research is needed to understand if running these races is safe.",

    "Red blood cells are important parts of your blood that help you stay healthy by carrying oxygen from your lungs to all parts of your body. They are like tiny delivery trucks. When you exercise, your body needs more oxygen, so red blood cells work harder. Ultramarathons are super long running races that can be over 100 miles, much longer than a regular marathon of 26 miles. Scientists study these races to see how they affect the body. In this study, they looked at how running such long distances might hurt red blood cells, making them less able to do their job. This is important because if red blood cells don't work well, you might feel tired or sick. The study helps us learn more about how extreme exercise can be both good and bad for our bodies."
