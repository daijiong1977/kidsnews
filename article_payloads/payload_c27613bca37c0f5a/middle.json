  "summary": "A devastating fire occurred at Le Constellation bar in the Crans-Montana ski resort in southern Switzerland on New Year's Day, resulting in numerous casualties. Authorities report that several dozen people are presumed dead, with around 40 fatalities cited by Italian officials, and over 100 injured, many with severe burns. The incident, which happened at 01:30 local time, is being treated as a fire with no indication of an attack, as stated by regional chief prosecutor Beatrice Pilloud. Emergency response included ten helicopters, forty ambulances, and 150 workers, overwhelming local hospital intensive care units. Victims include individuals from multiple nationalities, prompting embassies like the UK's to monitor and offer consular support. The cause remains unknown, with initial reports of an explosion clarified as a result of the fire's progression rather than an explosive device, according to security official Stéphane Ganzer. Efforts are focused on victim identification and family assistance.",

    "Fires in crowded venues like bars can lead to high casualties due to rapid spread and panic. Emergency management involves coordination between police, medical teams, and international agencies. Consular services assist nationals during crises abroad. Investigations into fire causes require forensic analysis to rule out criminal intent. Ski resorts often host international tourists, complicating victim identification and family notifications."
