  "title": "Police Looking into Royal Bodyguards",
  "summary": "The Metropolitan Police in London is starting to check on some bodyguards who used to protect Prince Andrew. These bodyguards worked for the Royalty and Specialist Protection team. A former police officer said the bodyguards might have ignored bad things when they went with Andrew to a private island owned by Jeffrey Epstein. Epstein was a man accused of hurting people, and some say they were hurt on his island. The police say they have not found any wrong actions yet but are trying to learn more. Andrew has been accused by a woman named Virginia Giuffre, but he says he did nothing wrong. The police will do a bigger investigation if they find problems. This story is important because it shows how police officers need to do their jobs properly to keep people safe.",
