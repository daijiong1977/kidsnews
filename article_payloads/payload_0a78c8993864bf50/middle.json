  "title": "Met Police Investigates Royal Protection Officers Over Epstein Island Visits",
  "summary": "The Metropolitan Police is conducting initial inquiries into close protection officers who were previously assigned to Prince Andrew Mountbatten Windsor. This follows allegations from an unnamed former senior Met officer, who told LBC that members of the Royalty and Specialist Protection (RaSP) unit may have deliberately ignored misconduct during visits to Jeffrey Epstein's private island, Little St James. Epstein, who died in prison in 2019, faced sex trafficking charges, and multiple survivors claim they were abused on the island. The Met stated it has not yet identified any wrongdoing but is working to establish facts. The former officer alleged that Andrew's protection team accompanied him to the island at least twice, including on Epstein's private jet, and expressed concerns from the late 1990s about officers becoming too close to those they protect, fearing demotion. Under police accountability rules, the Independent Office of Police Conduct (IOPC) would handle any further investigation if concerns arise. Andrew has been accused by Virginia Giuffre of sexual abuse on the island, though he denies this and settled financially without admitting guilt. This case highlights issues of police integrity and royal protection protocols.",

    "This article discusses the Metropolitan Police's initial inquiries into close protection officers who guarded Prince Andrew, following allegations related to visits to Jeffrey Epstein's private island. Epstein was a wealthy financier accused of sex trafficking, and his island, Little St James, is where multiple survivors allege abuse occurred. The Royalty and Specialist Protection (RaSP) unit is under scrutiny for possibly ignoring misconduct during these visits. A former senior officer raised concerns about officers becoming too close to those they protect, leading to fears of demotion. The Independent Office of Police Conduct (IOPC) oversees serious police complaints and would investigate further if needed. Prince Andrew has been accused by Virginia Giuffre of sexual abuse on the island, but he denies this and settled without admitting guilt. This case touches on police accountability, royal protection standards, and the broader Epstein scandal, highlighting the importance of ethical conduct in law enforcement."
