  "title": "Turning Gas into Medicine: A Cool Science Discovery",
  "summary": "Scientists have found a new way to change methane, a gas from natural gas, into useful chemicals like medicine. Methane is usually burned for energy, which can harm the environment. A team led by Martín Fañanás at a university in Spain made a special tool called a catalyst that helps turn methane into a medicine called dimestrol, used in hormone therapy. They use iron, which is cheap and safe, and LED light to make the reaction work without creating bad byproducts. This discovery could help make chemicals in a greener way, using abundant gas instead of relying on oil. It's part of a bigger effort to create a circular economy where we reuse materials better.",

    "Methane is a common gas from natural gas, often burned for heat and electricity, which releases greenhouse gases. Scientists want to use it for making chemicals instead to help the environment. Catalysts are substances that speed up reactions without being consumed. Hormone therapy uses medicines like dimestrol to treat health issues. Iron is a plentiful and safe metal. LED lights are energy-efficient. A circular economy means recycling and reusing resources to protect our planet."
