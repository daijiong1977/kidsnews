  "title": "Breakthrough in Converting Methane to Pharmaceuticals: A Step Toward Sustainability",
  "summary": "Researchers have developed a novel method to transform methane, a primary component of natural gas, into valuable chemical building blocks for pharmaceuticals, addressing the challenge of its stability. Led by Martín Fañanás at CiQUS, University of Santiago de Compostela, the team published their findings in Science Advances. They achieved a landmark by synthesizing dimestrol, a non-steroidal estrogen used in hormone therapy, directly from methane for the first time. The process involves allylation, attaching an allyl group to methane to create a functional handle for further chemical transformations. A key innovation is a custom iron-based supramolecular catalyst that controls free radicals, preventing unwanted chlorination side reactions and enabling selective allylation. This photocatalysis method uses iron, which is inexpensive and less toxic than rare metals, and operates under mild conditions with LED light, reducing energy use and environmental impact. Supported by the European Research Council, this work is part of broader efforts to upgrade natural gas into high-value chemicals, promoting a circular chemical economy by decreasing reliance on petrochemical feedstocks and enhancing sustainability in manufacturing.",

    "Methane is a stable hydrocarbon from natural gas, traditionally burned for energy, releasing greenhouse gases. Converting it into chemicals has been difficult due to its low reactivity. Allylation is a key chemical process that modifies molecules for further use. Catalysts, especially supramolecular ones, are crucial for controlling reactions like managing free radicals. Photocatalysis uses light to drive reactions, often with environmental benefits. The circular economy concept emphasizes recycling resources to reduce waste and pollution. Petrochemical feedstocks from oil are common in industry, but alternatives like natural gas could enhance sustainability. Hormone therapies, including non-steroidal estrogens, treat various medical conditions."
