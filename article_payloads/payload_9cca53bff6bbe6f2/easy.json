  "title": "Why Old Green Paint Fades and Cracks",
  "summary": "Scientists studied why green paint in old paintings, like one by James Ensor, changes over time. They found that light and moisture make the paint fade, crack, and turn dark. This green paint, called emerald-green, was used by famous artists long ago but can be harmful because it has arsenic. Researchers used special tools to look at tiny paint samples and test new paint to see how it breaks down. This helps art protectors keep masterpieces safe by controlling light and humidity in museums. Understanding this can prevent damage to beautiful artworks for everyone to enjoy.",
