  "summary": "Prince William and Princess Catherine have shared a new family photo for their Christmas card in 2025. The picture shows them sitting on grass with their three children: George, Charlotte, and Louis. It was taken by a photographer named Josh Shinner in Norfolk during spring. The family looks happy and close together. They posted the photo online with a message wishing everyone a Happy Christmas. This photo is part of Catherine's return to public life after she had cancer treatment. The family will spend Christmas with King Charles and other royals at Sandringham. Last year, they used a photo from when Catherine finished her chemotherapy for their card. This year's card shows a relaxed and informal side of the royal family.",
