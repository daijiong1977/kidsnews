  "title": "Royal Christmas Card: A Symbol of Informal Monarchy and Recovery",
  "summary": "Prince William and Princess Catherine have unveiled their 2025 Christmas card, featuring a family portrait taken by photographer Josh Shinner in Norfolk during April. The image depicts the couple and their children—Prince George, Princess Charlotte, and Prince Louis—relaxing on grass amid spring daffodils, projecting a casual and intimate family dynamic. Shared on social media with a festive greeting, this card reflects William's advocacy for a more informal approach to royalty, often described as a 'millennial vision' of a jumperish, tieless monarchy. Notably, the release marks another step in Catherine's gradual return to public life as she recovers from cancer and chemotherapy, with the photo symbolizing her togetherness with her family. The shoot appears to be the same used for George's 12th and Louis' 7th birthday photos, highlighting its personal significance. In contrast to last year's card, which used an image from Catherine's chemotherapy announcement video, this year's choice emphasizes normalcy and resilience. The family plans to spend Christmas at Sandringham with King Charles and other royals, following recent events like their 14th wedding anniversary and preparations to move into Forest Lodge in Windsor. This portrait serves as both a holiday tradition and a public statement on modern royal life and health recovery.",
