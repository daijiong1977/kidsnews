  "title": "Debating Leadership in Venezuela: Trust and Opposition Views",
  "summary": "This article from PBS NewsHour explores the political situation in Venezuela, focusing on leadership controversies. Nicolás Maduro, the current president, faces strong opposition, with Nobel Peace Prize winner María Corina Machado as a key leader. Her top aide, David Smolansky, criticizes Maduro's former vice president, Delcy Rodríguez, who was recently sworn in as acting president, stating she is not trustworthy to lead. The White House is engaging with remnants of Maduro's regime after a raid, highlighting U.S. involvement. Smolansky emphasizes that nine out of ten Venezuelans desire Maduro's removal and accountability, and he notes that the U.S. is ensuring rights like legal representation, which Maduro denied. The piece raises questions about who truly governs Venezuela—Rodríguez or U.S. influence—and underscores the ongoing struggle between the Maduro government and opposition forces seeking democratic change.",
