  "title": "Mystery of Women in a Medieval Cemetery",
  "summary": "Archaeologists in Wales are trying to solve a mystery about women buried in a medieval cemetery. They found 58 skeletons from the 6th or 7th century, and almost all are women. The team discovered a small building outline, beads, and other items that show the women might have been part of a religious community. The graves are shallow and cut into rock, and people wanted to be buried near the building, sometimes sharing graves. This helps us learn about life long ago and who these women were.",
