  "title": "Uncovering the Secrets of a Medieval Female Cemetery",
  "summary": "Archaeologists in Wales have made intriguing discoveries at a medieval cemetery dating to the 6th or 7th century, where 58 skeletons have been uncovered, with nearly all belonging to women. The site, located near Cardiff airport, features shallow graves cut into limestone bedrock, indicating hard lives but also wealth through artefacts like coloured glass beads. A key find is the outline of a potential small building, possibly a shrine or chapel, situated centrally with graves clustered around it, suggesting it was a highly desired burial location. Some graves contain multiple individuals, hinting at repeated use. These findings point to the cemetery being part of an early female religious community, helping archaeologists piece together the identity and social structure of these women from over a millennium ago.",

    "The medieval period, spanning from the 5th to the 15th century, was a time of significant social and religious change in Europe. Archaeologists study sites like cemeteries to uncover details about daily life, health, and beliefs. In Wales, early Christian communities often included monastic groups, and discoveries such as this cemetery help illustrate the role of women in religious contexts during this era, shedding light on gender roles and community structures."
