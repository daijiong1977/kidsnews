  "title": "Trademark Dispute: Cambridge University vs. Local Rowing Business",
  "summary": "Omar Terywall founded Cambridge Rowing Limited in Cambridge in 2021, offering novice rowing experiences on the River Cam through his Cambridge Rowing Experience. The company has introduced rowing to over 5,000 people, including hundreds of local children, promoting community engagement. In January 2022, Terywall applied to register a trademark featuring a shield with a rower and the words 'Cambridge Rowing.' However, in May 2022, the University of Cambridge filed a formal opposition, arguing the need to protect its trademarks from misuse. A hearing was held in 2025, with a decision expected in early 2026. Terywall describes the situation as terrifying and bullying, highlighting the power imbalance between his small local business and the university, a multibillion-pound entity. He feels overwhelmed and uncertain about legal recourse, emphasizing the challenges small entrepreneurs face when confronting large institutions over intellectual property rights. This case raises questions about trademark law, corporate dominance, and support for local enterprises.",
