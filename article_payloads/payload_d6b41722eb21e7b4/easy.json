  "title": "A Small Business Fights a Big University Over a Name",
  "summary": "Omar Terywall started a company called Cambridge Rowing Limited in Cambridge, his home city, in 2021. His company offers rowing experiences on the River Cam for beginners, including many local children, and has taught over 5,000 people. He wanted to trademark the name and logo with a shield and rower. But the University of Cambridge, a very large and rich organization, objected to the trademark in 2022, saying they need to protect their own trademarks. A hearing happened in 2025, and a decision is expected soon. Omar feels scared and bullied because the university is so big compared to his small business, and he doesn't know what to do. This story shows how a little company can get into a legal fight with a giant over a name.",
