  "title": "Coping with Jetlag: Strategies of Professional Tennis Players",
  "summary": "Professional tennis players face significant challenges with jetlag due to the global nature of their sport, traveling extensively for tournaments like the Australian Open. Jetlag, caused by crossing multiple time zones, leads to symptoms such as broken sleep and fatigue, which can impair athletic performance. Players must adapt quickly, often competing shortly after arrival. Novak Djokovic, a top player, employs a detailed routine including over-hydrating with lemon, mint, and salt water on flights, grounding himself barefoot on natural ground upon arrival, taking hot baths with Epsom salts, and watching the sunrise to reset his circadian rhythm. Other players, like Tristan Schoolkate and Alexandra Eala, acknowledge the inevitability of jetlag and emphasize the need to adjust, using methods such as natural herbal tablets with ingredients like valerian and chamomile or melatonin supplements. The ATP data shows men's players traveled 2.3 million km in 2024, highlighting the scale of this issue. Overall, players develop personalized strategies to regulate their sleep-wake cycles and maintain peak performance despite frequent travel.",

    "Jetlag is a physiological condition affecting travelers who cross three or more time zones, disrupting the body's internal clock. Symptoms include insomnia, daytime fatigue, and difficulty concentrating. In professional sports, jetlag can impact reaction times and endurance, making it a critical issue for athletes like tennis players who compete internationally. The circadian rhythm, which controls sleep patterns, can be reset through light exposure and routine adjustments. Players often use a combination of hydration, sleep aids, and natural therapies to mitigate effects. The ATP tour spans 29 countries, requiring constant adaptation. Understanding these strategies highlights the intersection of sports science and travel logistics in maintaining athletic performance."
