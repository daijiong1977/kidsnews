  "title": "Tennis Players and Jetlag: How They Handle Travel Tiredness",
  "summary": "Tennis players like Novak Djokovic travel all over the world for tournaments, and they often get jetlag, which makes them feel tired and have trouble sleeping. Jetlag happens when you cross many time zones, like when players fly to Australia for the Australian Open. Players have to play matches even when they are jetlagged, so they find ways to cope. For example, Djokovic drinks lots of water with lemon and salt on flights, walks barefoot on grass when he arrives, and watches the sunrise to help his body adjust. Other players use natural herbs or melatonin to sleep better. They all try to get over jetlag quickly so they can perform their best in matches.",
