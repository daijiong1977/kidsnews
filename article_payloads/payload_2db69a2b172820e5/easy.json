  "title": "China's Big New Embassy in the UK",
  "summary": "The UK government is thinking about letting China build a very large new embassy in London. An embassy is like a special office where people from one country work in another country. This plan is controversial, which means some people are worried about it. For example, they might be concerned about safety or how big the building will be. Even though a final decision hasn't been made, many experts think it will probably be approved. This could affect how the UK and China work together in the future. It's important to understand that embassies help countries talk to each other and solve problems. This news is based on reports from BBC News, which is a trusted source for information.",

    "An embassy is a place where diplomats from one country live and work in another country to help with relations, like trade and safety. The UK and China have been working together on many things, but sometimes there are disagreements. Building a big new embassy can be a sign of friendship, but it can also make people nervous if they think it might cause problems. This article talks about a plan that is not yet final, so it's important to wait for more news."
