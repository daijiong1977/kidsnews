  "title": "Scientists Build a Special Molecule to Fight Cancer",
  "summary": "Scientists at MIT have made a special molecule called verticillin A in their lab for the first time. This molecule comes from fungi and was discovered over 50 years ago. It is very hard to build because it has a tricky shape, but it might help fight cancer. In tests, a version of this molecule worked well against a type of brain cancer in kids. The scientists say more tests are needed to see if it can be used as a medicine. They had to change the way they built the molecule step by step to make it work. This discovery could lead to new cancer treatments in the future.",

    "Cancer is a disease where some cells in the body grow too fast and can make people sick. Scientists look for medicines to stop cancer. Sometimes, they find helpful chemicals in nature, like in fungi. Fungi are living things that can make special molecules. Building these molecules in a lab is hard because they have complex shapes. This article talks about scientists who made one such molecule, verticillin A, which might help treat cancer, especially in kids with brain cancer. They worked carefully to build it step by step."
