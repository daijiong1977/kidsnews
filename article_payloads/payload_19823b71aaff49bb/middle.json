    "BTS, formed in 2013 by Hybe (formerly Big Hit Entertainment), has risen to global fame with hits that blend pop, hip-hop, and R&B, earning them a massive fanbase called ARMY. In South Korea, military service is compulsory for men aged 18-28, typically lasting 18-21 months, and BTS members enlisted between 2022 and 2023, leading to a group hiatus. During this time, each member released solo music and engaged in individual activities, maintaining their presence in the industry. Their comeback in 2023 signals a reunion that fans have eagerly anticipated, with Netflix partnering to amplify their reach through streaming. This event highlights the intersection of music, culture, and digital media, showcasing how global artists use platforms like Netflix to connect with audiences. Understanding K-Pop's impact and South Korea's cultural policies adds context to BTS's journey and their role in promoting Korean culture worldwide."
