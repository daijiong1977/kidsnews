  "title": "A Big Landslide in Sicily Makes Homes Unsafe",
  "summary": "A huge landslide happened in a town called Niscemi in Sicily, Italy, after heavy rains from a cyclone. The landslide is 4 kilometers long and made a cliff where cars and buildings fell down. Over 1,500 people had to leave their homes because the ground is wet and moving, so it's not safe to live there. Italian leader Giorgia Meloni visited and promised to help with money and finding new homes for the families. The town was built on sandy and clay soil that gets slippery in rain, and this has happened before in 1997. Scientists warn that building in such areas is risky. The government has declared an emergency and is working to keep people safe.",

    "Sicily is an island in Italy known for its beautiful coasts and hills. Landslides can happen when heavy rain makes soil loose, causing it to slide down slopes. This can damage homes and roads, so people sometimes need to evacuate to stay safe. Governments often help by providing money and finding new places for families to live. It's important to build homes in safe areas to prevent such disasters."
