  "title": "Metasurface-Driven Nonlinear Photonics for Efficient Beam Steering",
  "summary": "A pioneering study from the Advanced Science Research Center at CUNY introduces a metasurface chip capable of nonlinear light generation and precise beam steering without mechanical components. This ultra-thin device utilizes nanostructures to convert infrared laser light at 1530 nm into visible green light at 510 nm through third harmonic generation, while dynamically controlling beam direction via polarization modulation. The innovation lies in overcoming the traditional tradeoff between efficiency and control in metasurfaces by employing a quasi bound state in the continuum resonance to enhance light intensity across the entire surface, coupled with a strategically rotated pattern of structural elements that impart a position-dependent phase, functioning as an integrated lens. This design yields a third harmonic signal approximately 100 times more efficient than comparable beam-shaping devices. The research, published in eLight, highlights applications in LiDAR, quantum light generation, and optical signal processing, with the geometry-based approach allowing adaptability across various nonlinear materials and spectral ranges. Future prospects include multi-layered metasurfaces for expanded wavelength coverage, underscoring its potential in advancing integrated photonics and compact light sources.",
