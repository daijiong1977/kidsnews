  "title": "Advancing Light Control with a Metasurface Chip",
  "summary": "Researchers at the Advanced Science Research Center at CUNY have developed a metasurface chip that converts infrared light into visible light and steers the beam directionally without mechanical parts. This ultra-thin chip features nanostructures smaller than light wavelengths, enabling it to shift infrared laser light to a higher frequency, producing a focused green beam. By altering the polarization of incoming light, the beam's direction can be adjusted precisely. In tests, it transformed 1530 nm infrared light to 510 nm green light with high accuracy. The chip overcomes a longstanding tradeoff in metasurfaces: balancing efficiency and control. It uses a collective resonance called a quasi bound state in the continuum to enhance light across the surface while rotating structural elements for phase control, akin to a built-in lens. This design yields third harmonic light with 100 times more efficiency than similar devices. Potential applications include LiDAR, quantum light generation, and optical signal processing, as the geometry-based concept can be adapted to various materials and light colors. Future developments may involve stacking metasurfaces for broader wavelength ranges.",
