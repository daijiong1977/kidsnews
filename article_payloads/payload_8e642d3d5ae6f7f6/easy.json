  "title": "A Tiny Chip That Changes and Points Light",
  "summary": "Scientists have made a very thin chip that can change invisible light into visible light and point it in different directions. This chip is called a metasurface and has tiny structures on it. When an infrared laser hits the chip, it turns the light into a green beam that can be aimed by changing how the light waves are aligned. This is like having a flat, microscopic spotlight that can shine light where you want without any moving parts. The chip is very efficient and could be used in technologies like LiDAR for self-driving cars or in communication systems. It helps solve a problem where other devices are either good at controlling light or making it strong, but not both. This new chip does both, making it a big step forward for small, powerful light devices.",

    "Light is a form of energy that we see as colors. Invisible light, like infrared, is used in things like TV remotes. Scientists make tiny devices to control light for better technology. This chip helps by changing and pointing light without needing big parts that move, making it useful for small gadgets and communication."
