  "title": "Exploring Forbidden Antimatter Transformations in Particle Physics",
  "summary": "An international team of scientists, led by researchers at Sun Yat-sen University and the Institute of Modern Physics of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, has initiated the MACE experiment to search for a rare transformation where muonium converts into antimuonium. Muonium is a short-lived system composed of a positive muon and an electron, and its conversion to antimuonium would violate lepton flavor conservation, a fundamental principle of the Standard Model in particle physics. Observing this event could provide direct evidence for new physics beyond current theories, potentially revealing insights into phenomena like ∆Lℓ = 2 models that are distinct from other lepton flavor violation processes. MACE aims to improve sensitivity by over a hundred times compared to previous experiments, using advanced technologies such as a powerful surface muon beam, a silica aerogel target, and precise detectors to isolate signals from backgrounds. If successful, it could explore energy scales up to 100 TeV, rivaling future colliders, and also investigate other rare decays like M→γγ and μ→eγγ. The project is part of broader efforts at Huizhou's facilities, including HIAF and CiADS, to position China as a leader in high-precision physics, while also driving technological innovations with applications in materials science and medical research.",

    "Particle physics explores the fundamental particles and forces that govern the universe, with the Standard Model as the prevailing theory. Lepton flavor conservation is a key aspect of this model, prohibiting certain particle transformations, but experiments like MACE test its limits by searching for violations such as muonium to antimuonium conversion. Muonium is an exotic atom formed from a muon and an electron, and antimuonium is its antimatter counterpart. Previous constraints on this conversion were set in 1999, but MACE uses cutting-edge technologies to push sensitivity further. The project is integrated into China's research infrastructure, including HIAF and CiADS, highlighting global efforts in high-energy physics. Understanding these rare events could unveil new physics, potentially leading to revisions of the Standard Model and inspiring technological advances with cross-disciplinary impacts."
