  "title": "Probing Lepton Flavor Violation Through Muonium-Antimuonium Conversion in the MACE Experiment",
  "summary": "The MACE experiment, spearheaded by an international consortium from Sun Yat-sen University and the Institute of Modern Physics of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, seeks to observe the forbidden transformation of muonium into antimuonium, a process that would constitute a clear violation of lepton flavor conservation within the Standard Model of particle physics. Muonium, a bound state of a positive muon and an electron, offers a unique probe for new physics in the leptonic sector, particularly sensitive to ∆Lℓ = 2 theoretical models that differ fundamentally from other charged lepton flavor violation mechanisms. By enhancing experimental sensitivity by over two orders of magnitude beyond the 1999 constraint from the Paul Scherrer Institute, MACE targets conversion probabilities as minute as O(10-13), employing a sophisticated apparatus including a high-intensity surface muon beam, a novel silica aerogel target for efficient muonium generation, and precision detectors to mitigate formidable backgrounds. Success in detecting this transformation could enable exploration of new physics at energy scales ranging from 10 to 100 TeV, potentially surpassing the reach of future colliders, while Phase I of the experiment will also investigate other rare decays such as M→γγ and μ→eγγ with record-breaking precision. Embedded within China's strategic initiatives like the High-intensity heavy-ion Accelerator Facility (HIAF) and the China initiative Accelerator Driven System (CiADS), MACE exemplifies how foundational research catalyzes technological innovation—with spin-offs in materials science and medical diagnostics—and strengthens global scientific collaboration, aiming to redefine fundamental symmetries and our comprehension of the universe.",

    "Particle physics operates within the framework of the Standard Model, which incorporates lepton flavor conservation as a fundamental symmetry, but anomalies and theoretical extensions suggest potential violations. Muonium, an exotic atom comprising a muon and electron, serves as an ideal system for testing these boundaries due to its clean theoretical predictions and sensitivity to new physics models like ∆Lℓ = 2. Historical constraints on muonium-antimuonium conversion were established in the late 20th century, but advances in accelerator and detector technology enable modern experiments like MACE to achieve unprecedented sensitivities. The experiment's design integrates state-of-the-art components, such as a surface muon beam and silica aerogel targets, to optimize signal detection while minimizing backgrounds. Success could illuminate physics at multi-TeV scales, complementing collider searches, and drive innovations with societal benefits. This endeavor is situated within China's expanding role in global science, leveraging facilities like HIAF and CiADS to enhance collaborative research and technological development."
