  "title": "Cold Weather Warnings in the UK",
  "summary": "The UK is getting very cold weather from Arctic air. The Met Office has issued amber warnings for snow and ice, which means it could be dangerous. Yellow warnings are also in place in many areas. Temperatures dropped below freezing in southern England and South Wales, with places like Bournemouth reaching -6.2°C. In Northern Scotland, heavy snow is falling, and an amber warning is active from Friday to Saturday, expecting 10-20 cm of snow in low areas and up to 40 cm on high ground. This could cause travel problems, like delays on roads or communities getting cut off. People should be careful and stay warm.",

    "The UK sometimes gets very cold weather in winter, especially from Arctic winds. The Met Office uses color-coded warnings to tell people about bad weather: yellow means be aware, amber means be prepared, and red means take action. Snow and ice can make roads slippery and cause accidents, so it's important to listen to warnings and stay safe."
