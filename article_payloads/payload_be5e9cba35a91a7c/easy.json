  "title": "President Trump's Special Walkway at the White House",
  "summary": "President Donald Trump made a special walkway at the White House with bronze plaques for each U.S. president. These plaques have descriptions that sound like his social media posts, and some of them are not true. For example, Joe Biden's plaque says he won the election because it was corrupt, but that is false because many lawsuits and investigations found no evidence of fraud. It also says Biden had the highest inflation ever, but inflation was higher in the 1970s and 1980s. Barack Obama's plaque calls him divisive, but polls show many people like him. It says his health care law was ineffective, but it helped more people get insurance. The article checks these facts to show what is true and what is not.",
