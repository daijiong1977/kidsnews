  "title": "Examining the Accuracy of Trump's Presidential Plaques at the White House",
  "summary": "President Donald Trump installed bronze plaques along a White House walkway, each honoring a U.S. president but written in a style reminiscent of his Truth Social posts, often containing misleading or false statements. The article, sourced from PolitiFact, fact-checks these plaques, focusing on recent Democratic presidents. For Joe Biden, the plaque falsely claims he took office due to a corrupt election, but numerous lawsuits and investigations, including by Republican groups, found no evidence to invalidate the 2020 results. It also inaccurately states Biden oversaw the highest inflation ever, though inflation peaked in the late 1970s and early 1980s. For Barack Obama, the plaque labels him divisive despite high favorability ratings, and calls the Affordable Care Act ineffective, despite data showing a significant drop in uninsured Americans. Additionally, it falsely accuses Obama of spying on Trump's campaign, but bipartisan reports found no political influence in FBI investigations. The analysis highlights how these plaques spread misinformation and the importance of verifying facts with reliable sources.",
