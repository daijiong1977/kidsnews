  "title": "Better Soil Helps Farmers Grow More Food and Stop Hungry Bugs",
  "summary": "Scientists found a simple way to help farmers grow more food and protect it from locusts, which are insects that can eat crops. They worked with farmers in Senegal, a country in Africa, where locusts often damage millet plants. The farmers planted two fields: one with special fertilizer that adds nitrogen to the soil and one without. The field with fertilizer had fewer locusts, less damage to the plants, and produced twice as much millet. This means better soil helps plants grow stronger and keeps bugs away. The study shows that improving soil can be a good tool for farmers to use without harming the environment. It was led by a scientist named Arianne Cease, who studies locusts at Arizona State University.",

    "Locusts are insects that can form big groups called swarms and eat crops, which is bad for farmers who need food. In some places like Senegal, locusts damage plants like millet. Scientists study ways to stop this without using harmful chemicals. Soil is the dirt where plants grow, and adding things like fertilizer can make it healthier. This study shows that better soil can help farmers grow more food and protect it from bugs."
