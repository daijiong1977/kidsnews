  "title": "Giant Shark from Dinosaur Times in Australia",
  "summary": "Long ago, about 115 million years ago, a huge shark lived in the ocean near Australia. Scientists found fossils of its bones, which are like the Great White shark's but bigger. This shark was an early relative of today's big sharks and was a top predator, eating other animals in the sea. Sharks have been around for over 400 million years, but this one shows they grew large much earlier than we thought. Fossils are mostly teeth because shark skeletons are soft and don't fossilize well. The discovery helps us learn how sharks evolved and changed in size over time.",

    "Sharks are ancient fish that have lived for millions of years. They have skeletons made of cartilage, which is softer than bone, so their bodies don't fossilize well. Instead, we often find their teeth as fossils. This article talks about a big shark found in Australia from the time of dinosaurs, showing that sharks became huge predators long ago. Learning about fossils helps scientists understand how animals evolved and what the world was like in the past."
