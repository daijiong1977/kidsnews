  "title": "Giant Shark from Dinosaur Times in Australia",
  "summary": "Long ago, about 115 million years, a huge shark lived in the ocean near Australia. Scientists found fossils of its bones, which are like the Great White shark's but bigger. This shark was a top predator and ate other animals in the sea. It shows that big sharks existed much earlier than we thought. Fossils are old remains that help us learn about the past. This discovery helps us understand how sharks changed over time. The research was done by experts from different countries, and you can see the fossils in a museum.",

  "background_read": [
    "Sharks are fish that have been around for millions of years. They have skeletons made of cartilage, which is softer than bone, so their bodies don't fossilize well. Fossils are like nature's photographs from the past, showing us what life was like long ago. In dinosaur times, the oceans were full of giant creatures like marine reptiles and big fish. Scientists study fossils to learn how animals evolved and changed over time. This helps us understand the history of life on Earth."
