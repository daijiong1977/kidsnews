  "title": "Early Giant Sharks in Prehistoric Australia",
  "summary": "Recent research has uncovered fossils of a massive shark that lived approximately 115 million years ago in the waters north of Australia. These fossils, specifically vertebrae, belong to a cardabiodontid shark, an early relative of modern lamniform sharks like the Great White. The vertebrae are larger than those of adult Great Whites, indicating the shark reached significant size much earlier in evolutionary history than previously believed. This discovery challenges earlier assumptions that large sharks only evolved later. The study involved a team of international experts using advanced techniques like tomography to analyze the fossils. It highlights that these giant sharks coexisted with other apex predators, such as marine reptiles, during the Age of Dinosaurs. The findings, published in Communications Biology, provide insights into how shark sizes changed over deep time and emphasize the importance of interdisciplinary collaboration in paleontology.",

    "Sharks have existed for over 400 million years, with modern lineages like lamniforms appearing around 135 million years ago. Initially small, they evolved into giants like Megalodon. Fossils are crucial for studying evolution, but shark fossils are rare due to cartilaginous skeletons, so teeth and vertebrae are common finds. The Tethys Ocean was a major body of water during the Mesozoic Era, hosting diverse marine life. Paleontology uses interdisciplinary methods, such as tomography, to analyze fossils without damaging them. This field helps reconstruct ancient ecosystems and understand how species adapted over time, revealing insights into climate changes and extinction events."
