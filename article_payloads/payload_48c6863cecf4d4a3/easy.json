  "title": "Obesity Makes Alzheimer's Disease Worse Faster",
  "summary": "Scientists have discovered that obesity speeds up Alzheimer's disease. They studied people for five years and found that those with obesity had faster increases in certain blood markers linked to Alzheimer's. These markers show brain changes like protein buildup. At first, people with obesity seemed to have lower levels of these markers, but over time, they rose much quicker—up to 95% faster. The researchers used blood tests and brain scans to see this. They say obesity is a risk factor that can be changed to help slow down Alzheimer's. This study helps doctors understand how body weight affects brain health and could lead to better prevention strategies.",

    "Alzheimer's disease is a common brain disorder that affects memory and thinking, often in older adults. Obesity means having too much body weight from fat, which can lead to health problems. Scientists study blood and brain scans to understand diseases better. This research shows how keeping a healthy weight might help protect the brain from Alzheimer's."
