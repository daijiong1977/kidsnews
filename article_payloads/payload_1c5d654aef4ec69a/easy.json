  "title": "Belarus Frees Famous Prisoners as U.S. Helps with Trade",
  "summary": "Belarus, a country in Europe, let go of some important people from jail on Saturday. These people include Ales Bialiatski, who won a big peace prize, and Maria Kolesnikova, who spoke out against the government. They were political prisoners, meaning they were jailed for their beliefs. At the same time, the United States decided to remove trade restrictions on Belarus's potash, a type of fertilizer. This happened because Belarus's leader, Alexander Lukashenko, wants to get along better with the U.S. In exchange for lifting the sanctions, Lukashenko pardoned 123 prisoners. Belarus has been isolated by Western countries for many years due to human rights issues and its support for Russia in the Ukraine war. Since July 2024, Belarus has freed hundreds of prisoners. A U.S. official, John Coale, met with Lukashenko and said the talks were productive, aiming to improve relations between the two countries.",

    "Belarus is a country in Eastern Europe led by Alexander Lukashenko, who has been in power for over 30 years. It has faced criticism from Western countries for human rights abuses and supporting Russia in conflicts. Political prisoners are people jailed for opposing the government, and sanctions are penalties like trade restrictions used to pressure countries. Potash is a key export for Belarus, used in fertilizer to help plants grow. The U.S. and Belarus have had tense relations, but recent talks aim to make things better by trading prisoner releases for lifted sanctions."
