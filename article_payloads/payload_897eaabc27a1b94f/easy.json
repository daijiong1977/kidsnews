  "title": "Teachers in Scotland Wait for Jobs or Move Away",
  "summary": "In Scotland, many teachers are having trouble finding permanent jobs. Some teachers wait for years on a supply list, which means they only get temporary work in schools. Others, like Louise, move to other countries like Dubai to find stable jobs. Louise wants to come back to Scotland but is scared because there might not be a teaching job for her. Another teacher has been on the supply list for almost ten years and has had money problems because of it. The government says they are trying to hire more teachers, but it is expensive. This shows that Scotland needs more teaching jobs so teachers can stay and work.",

    "In Scotland, teachers go to school to learn how to teach. After they finish, they need to find jobs in schools. A permanent job means they can work for many years and feel secure. Sometimes, there are not enough jobs, so teachers have to take temporary work from a supply list or move to other places. This can make it hard for them to plan their lives and pay bills. The government is responsible for making sure there are enough jobs for teachers."
