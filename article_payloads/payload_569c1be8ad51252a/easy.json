  "title": "England's Arts Funding Gets a Big Change",
  "summary": "A big review says England's arts funding needs to change. Arts Council England gives out over £680 million each year to support art like music and theater. But many people think the current rules are too strict and don't focus enough on making great art. The review was done by Dame Margaret Hodge, who used to be a minister. She suggests that local groups should have more say in how money is spent, instead of just one big council deciding everything. She also wants to replace a plan called Let's Create, which some say stops artists from being creative. For example, Wigmore Hall, a famous music place in London, left the funding system because it felt the rules were too hard. The Arts Council says it will listen and try to do better, but it still believes in supporting both excellent art and making art available to everyone.",

    "Arts funding is money that helps artists and places like theaters or music halls make art for people to enjoy. In England, a group called Arts Council England decides who gets this money. Sometimes, people argue about whether the money should go to making the best art or to making sure everyone can see art. This review looks at how to make the system fairer and better for everyone."
