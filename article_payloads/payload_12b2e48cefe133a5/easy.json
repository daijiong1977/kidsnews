  "title": "A New Law About Voting in America",
  "summary": "A new law called the SAVE America Act is being talked about in Congress. It wants to make people show proof they are U.S. citizens before they can vote. Some people, like Republicans, think this is a good idea because they worry that noncitizens might vote, even though it is already illegal and very rare. Other people, like voting rights groups, say this law could stop millions of Americans from voting because they might not have the right papers. The law is being voted on in the House of Representatives, but it might not pass in the Senate. The president supports this law, but some election officials are worried because voting is usually handled by states, not the federal government. This is happening before important elections.",

    "In the United States, voting is a right for citizens to choose their leaders. Laws are made by Congress, which has two parts: the House and the Senate. Sometimes, new laws are proposed to change how voting works, like requiring ID or proof of citizenship. People have different opinions about these laws: some think they keep elections fair, while others worry they make it harder for people to vote. This article talks about one such law called the SAVE America Act."
