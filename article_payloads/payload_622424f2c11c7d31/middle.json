  "title": "Zimbabwe Implements Long-Acting HIV Drug to Combat Infections",
  "summary": "Zimbabwe has launched lenacapavir, a long-acting HIV prevention drug, becoming one of the first countries to roll it out. The drug, administered via injection twice a year, aims to reduce new HIV infections, particularly among high-risk groups such as sex workers, adolescent girls, young women, gay men, and pregnant or breastfeeding women. At a launch event in Harare, individuals like Constance Mukoloka, a 27-year-old sex worker, received the injection, expressing relief from the challenges of daily PrEP pills, which caused tension with clients and inconsistent use. Developed by Gilead Sciences in California, lenacapavir is supported by donor programs including the U.S. President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) and the Global Fund, with a rollout across 10 African countries. Clinical studies show near-total protection, offering hope for slowing the HIV epidemic in Zimbabwe, where tens of thousands have died from HIV over two decades. However, health officials warn that achieving broad impact requires overcoming funding constraints, infrastructure gaps, and ensuring patient engagement. The free provision in Zimbabwe highlights efforts to make prevention accessible, but challenges remain in scaling up within fragile health systems.",

    "HIV/AIDS has been a major public health crisis in Zimbabwe, causing tens of thousands of deaths over the past two decades. Prevention strategies have traditionally relied on methods like condoms and daily PrEP pills, but adherence can be challenging for high-risk groups. Lenacapavir represents an advancement in HIV prevention, offering long-acting protection through biannual injections. Its rollout in Zimbabwe is part of a broader initiative across Africa, supported by international donors like PEPFAR and the Global Fund, aiming to reduce new infections. However, success depends on addressing systemic issues such as funding limitations and weak health infrastructure, which are common in many affected regions. Understanding these contexts helps appreciate the potential impact and obstacles of this new drug."
