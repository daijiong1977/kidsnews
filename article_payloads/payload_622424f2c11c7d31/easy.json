  "title": "Zimbabwe Starts New HIV Prevention Medicine",
  "summary": "Zimbabwe is one of the first countries to use a new medicine called lenacapavir to help prevent HIV, a serious disease. People in Zimbabwe, including young women, mothers, and some men, lined up to get an injection of this medicine. It only needs to be given twice a year, which is much easier than taking pills every day. A woman named Constance Mukoloka, who is a sex worker, got the injection and feels safer now. The medicine is free for high-risk people like sex workers, young women, and gay men. It is supported by donors from other countries. Health officials hope this new medicine will slow down new HIV infections in Zimbabwe, where many people have died from HIV over the years. The medicine is made by a company in California and is being rolled out in 10 African countries with help from programs like PEPFAR.",
