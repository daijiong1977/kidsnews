  "title": "A Cool New Light Tool for Future Phones and Computers",
  "summary": "Scientists have made a special device that creates two kinds of twisty light shapes called skyrmions. These light shapes are very strong and don't break easily, even when there is interference. This makes them great for sending information in future wireless systems like phones or internet connections. The device can switch between an electric mode and a magnetic mode using the same platform, which helps control the light better. It uses a thin material called a metasurface to shape the light. This research could lead to faster and more reliable communication technologies. The team tested their device and saw it worked well, and they plan to improve it for real-world use.",
