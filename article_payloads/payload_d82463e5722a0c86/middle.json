  "title": "Advancing Wireless Tech with Switchable Light Vortices",
  "summary": "Researchers have developed an optical device capable of generating two distinct vortex-shaped light patterns, known as skyrmions, in terahertz pulses. These skyrmions are exceptionally stable and resistant to interference, making them promising for encoding information in future wireless communication systems. The device uses a nonlinear metasurface—a nanoscale-patterned material—to actively switch between electric and magnetic modes within toroidal light pulses. This controllability is achieved by manipulating the polarization of input laser pulses, allowing for reliable selection and reproduction of desired states. The team, led by scientists from Tianjin University and Nanyang Technological University, demonstrated this innovation experimentally and published their findings in Optica. They built a measurement setup to validate the switching behavior and confirmed high purity in each mode. This work could lead to more resilient terahertz wireless communication and advanced light-based information processing, with potential applications in compact circuits that generate and route signals. Future plans include refining the device for practical use.",
