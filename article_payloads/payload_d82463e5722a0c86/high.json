  "title": "Innovations in Topological Photonics: Switchable Skyrmions for Enhanced Terahertz Communication",
  "summary": "This article details a groundbreaking optical device that generates and actively switches between electric and magnetic skyrmions within toroidal terahertz light pulses. Skyrmions are topological light structures characterized by exceptional stability and resistance to interference, rendering them highly suitable for robust information encoding in future wireless communication systems. The device employs a nonlinear metasurface—a nanoscale-engineered material—to convert shaped near-infrared femtosecond laser pulses into tailored terahertz vortices. By manipulating the polarization patterns of the input laser using optical elements like wave plates and vortex retarders, the device achieves controllable switching between distinct topological states. The research, conducted by a team from Tianjin University and Nanyang Technological University and published in Optica, represents the first experimental demonstration of such switchable skyrmions in free-space propagation. Experimental validation involved an ultrafast terahertz measurement setup that reconstructed electromagnetic field evolution, confirming high purity and reliable switching performance. This work advances the field of topological photonics, with potential implications for developing resilient terahertz wireless networks and programmable light-based circuits for signal processing. Future directions include refining the device for practical applications and exploring broader implementations in information technology.",
