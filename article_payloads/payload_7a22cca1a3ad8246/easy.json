  "title": "Robots Explore Caves to Help Build Moon Homes",
  "summary": "Scientists are using robots to explore lava tubes, which are like caves on the Moon and Mars. These caves can protect astronauts from dangerous radiation and meteorites. A team from Europe, including the University of Malaga, made three types of robots that work together to map these caves. They tested the robots in caves in Lanzarote, Spain. The robots go through four steps: first, they map the area near the cave entrance; second, they drop a cube with sensors inside to take measurements; third, a small rover goes down into the cave; and fourth, they explore and make 3D maps. This helps prepare for future missions to the Moon, where robots could build bases. The Space Robotics Laboratory at the University of Malaga teaches students and works with other groups to make robots smarter for space.",

    "Lava tubes are natural tunnels formed by flowing lava on planets like the Moon and Mars. They are important because they offer shelter from space dangers like radiation and meteorites. Robots are machines that can be programmed to do tasks without humans, and scientists use them to explore places too risky for people. The University of Malaga in Spain has a lab that focuses on making robots for space missions, teaching students, and working with other groups to advance technology."
