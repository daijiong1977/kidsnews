  "title": "Robotic Teams Explore Lava Tubes for Lunar Base Preparation",
  "summary": "Researchers are developing autonomous robotic systems to explore lava tubes on the Moon and Mars, which are considered ideal locations for future human bases due to their natural protection from radiation and meteorite impacts. A European consortium, including the Space Robotics Laboratory at the University of Malaga, has created a mission concept involving three types of robots that collaborate autonomously. The mission consists of four phases: mapping the area around a lava tube entrance, deploying a sensorized payload cube for initial measurements, sending a scout rover to rappel into the tube, and conducting in-depth exploration to produce detailed 3D maps. Field tests in volcanic caves in Lanzarote, Spain, in February 2023 demonstrated the feasibility of this approach, led by the German Research Center for Artificial Intelligence with contributions from the University of Malaga and GMV. The findings support the use of collaborative robots in planetary exploration, highlighting their potential for missions to the Moon and Mars. The Space Robotics Laboratory focuses on enhancing autonomy in space robotics through algorithms for route planning and independent operation, while also training students and partnering with institutions like the European Space Agency.",

    "Lava tubes are geological features formed when the surface of lava flows cools and solidifies while molten lava continues to flow underneath, creating hollow tunnels. On the Moon and Mars, these structures offer potential habitats for astronauts because they protect against cosmic radiation, solar flares, and micrometeorite impacts. Autonomous robotics involves machines that can sense, decide, and act without human intervention, using algorithms and sensors. The European Space Agency and other international groups fund research to advance space technology, with a focus on robotic exploration to reduce risks for human missions. The University of Malaga's Space Robotics Laboratory collaborates with industry and academia to develop innovative solutions for space challenges, emphasizing education and practical applications."
