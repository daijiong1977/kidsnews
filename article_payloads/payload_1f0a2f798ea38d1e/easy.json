Doctors in Manchester used a special gene therapy to help him, and he is the first person in the world to get this treatment. After one year, Oliver is doing much better and growing like other kids. His family is very happy, and this story shows how new medical ideas can bring hope. Scientists worked hard to create this therapy, and it almost didn't happen because of money problems. Now, Oliver's progress amazes everyone, including his doctors and parents.",

    "Hunter syndrome is a rare genetic disease that affects children, causing problems with their body and brain. It happens when a gene doesn't work right, and kids might not live long. Gene therapy is a new way to fix genes by changing cells in the body. Doctors use it to treat diseases that have no cure. In this story, a boy named Oliver got this therapy and is doing better, which gives hope to other families."
