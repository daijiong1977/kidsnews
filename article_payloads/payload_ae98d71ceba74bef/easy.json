    "Andrew is a member of the British royal family and brother to King Charles. In the UK, police can arrest someone if they suspect a crime, like misconduct in public office, which means a person in a public job might have behaved badly. After arrest, people are questioned and may be released if there isn't enough evidence yet. Royal family members can face legal issues just like anyone else, and this can impact their roles and public image."
