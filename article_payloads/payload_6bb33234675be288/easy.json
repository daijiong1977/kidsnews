  "title": "NASA's Big Rocket Moves to the Launch Pad for a Moon Trip",
  "summary": "NASA's Artemis II rocket and spacecraft moved to the launch pad in Florida. It took 12 hours to roll out from a big building. A slow crawler carried the rocket 4 miles to the pad. Engineers will now do a test called a wet dress rehearsal. This test practices fueling the rocket and counting down like on launch day. The Artemis II mission will carry four astronauts around the Moon for 10 days. This is a step to help NASA send people back to the Moon and later to Mars. The rocket is part of NASA's plan to explore space with humans.",

    "NASA is planning to send people back to the Moon with the Artemis program. Artemis II is a test flight that will carry astronauts around the Moon without landing. This helps NASA learn how to live and work in space for longer trips, like going to Mars. Rockets are launched from pads, and tests like wet dress rehearsals make sure everything is safe before the real launch."
