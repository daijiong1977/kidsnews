  "title": "A New 3D Chip for Faster Computers",
  "summary": "Scientists from universities like Stanford and MIT worked with a company called SkyWater Technology to make a new computer chip. This chip is special because it is built in 3D, like a tall building with many floors stacked on top of each other. Most chips today are flat and 2D, which can slow down computers because data has to travel long distances. The 3D chip has many fast connections between its layers, so it can move data quickly and avoid waiting times. This helps make artificial intelligence (AI) systems like ChatGPT work faster. The chip was tested and found to be much better than flat chips. It was made in a factory that builds chips for real use, not just in a lab. This could lead to new innovations in technology and help the U.S. make more chips at home.",

    "Computer chips are tiny parts inside devices like phones and computers that help them process information. Most chips today are flat, which can cause delays when moving data between memory and computing parts. This new 3D chip is built upward with layers stacked closely, allowing faster data movement and better performance for tasks like AI, which needs lots of data quickly. It was created by scientists from top universities and a U.S. company to advance technology and support domestic chip production."
