  "title": "The Impact of Sleep Duration on Lifespan",
  "summary": "Recent research from Oregon Health & Science University reveals a strong correlation between insufficient sleep and reduced life expectancy. Analyzing national data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention between 2019 and 2025, scientists examined county-level life expectancy alongside survey responses on sleep habits. The study found that regularly sleeping less than seven hours per night is associated with a shorter lifespan, with this factor showing a stronger link to life expectancy than diet, physical activity, or social isolation. Only smoking had a greater influence. Researchers, including senior author Andrew McHill, were surprised by the strength of this association, noting that sleep duration outweighed other lifestyle predictors in their models. This is the first study to track year-by-year connections between sleep and life expectancy across all U.S. states, using the CDC's definition of sufficient sleep as at least seven hours. While the biological mechanisms weren't explored, sleep is known to support heart health, immune function, and cognitive performance, suggesting why it may play a critical role in longevity.",

    "Sleep is a vital biological process that allows the body to rest, repair, and consolidate memories. In recent years, scientific research has increasingly highlighted its role in overall health, including cardiovascular function, immune response, and cognitive abilities. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends at least seven hours of sleep per night for adults, based on guidelines from organizations like the American Academy of Sleep Medicine. Studies have linked poor sleep to various health issues, such as obesity, diabetes, and heart disease, but this new research from Oregon Health & Science University provides a broader perspective by examining sleep's impact on life expectancy at a national level. By analyzing large datasets, scientists can identify patterns that help public health initiatives promote better sleep habits to improve longevity and quality of life."

    "Main Points: The study found a strong link between sleeping less than seven hours and reduced life expectancy, with sleep being a more significant predictor than diet or exercise, though smoking had a greater effect. Purpose: To investigate the relationship between sleep duration and lifespan using national data, highlighting sleep's importance for public health. Evidence Evaluation: Relies on CDC survey data from 2019-2025, which is reputable but observational, so it shows correlation not causation. Author Credibility: Conducted by researchers at OHSU, with senior author Andrew McHill being a sleep physiologist, adding expertise. Methodology: Analyzed county-level life expectancy and sleep data across all U.S. states annually, using statistical models to assess associations."
