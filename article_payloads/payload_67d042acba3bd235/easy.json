  "title": "Sleep and How Long You Live",
  "summary": "Sleep is very important for how long you might live. A new study from Oregon Health & Science University found that people who regularly sleep less than 7 hours each night could have a shorter life. The researchers looked at data from across the United States between 2019 and 2025. They compared how long people live in different counties with how much sleep they get. Sleep was more linked to life expectancy than diet, exercise, or feeling lonely. Only smoking had a bigger effect. The scientists were surprised by how strong this link was. They say everyone should try to sleep 7 to 9 hours every night to stay healthy and live longer. Sleep helps your heart, immune system, and brain work well.",

    "Sleep is when our bodies rest and repair themselves. Getting enough sleep helps us feel good, think clearly, and stay healthy. Scientists study sleep to understand how it affects our lives. In this article, researchers looked at data from many people in the U.S. to see if sleeping less than 7 hours is connected to living a shorter life. They found that sleep is very important, and not getting enough can be bad for our health over time. This helps us learn why we should make sleep a priority every night."
