  "title": "Sabalenka's Emotional Victory and Mental Growth in Tennis",
  "summary": "Aryna Sabalenka, the world number one tennis player, faced a challenging match against Anastasia Potapova in the Australian Open fourth round. Despite being a heavy favorite and leading comfortably, Sabalenka experienced emotional turmoil, describing herself as 'emotionally all over the place' and 'disconnected from my body' as Potapova mounted a comeback. Sabalenka ultimately won 7-6 (7-4) 7-6 (9-7) after fending off four set points, showcasing her resilience. She reflected that earlier in her career, she would have lost such matches due to emotional struggles. Sabalenka has worked with a psychologist to improve her mental game, learning to focus on mentality rather than feelings. Her recent success includes winning the Australian Open in 2023 and 2024, reaching multiple Grand Slam semi-finals, and establishing dominance in women's tennis with four major titles in three seasons. This match highlights her growth in handling pressure and maintaining mental strength under adversity.",
