  "title": "A Big Solar Storm Squeezed Earth's Protective Bubble",
  "summary": "A huge solar storm called the Gannon storm hit Earth in May 2024. It was the strongest in over 20 years. Solar storms happen when the Sun sends lots of energy and particles toward our planet. Scientists used a satellite named Arase to watch what happened. They saw that the storm squeezed Earth's plasmasphere, which is a protective layer of charged particles around Earth. This layer got much smaller, shrinking from 44,000 km to only 9,600 km high. It took more than four days to grow back, which is very slow. This storm also made beautiful auroras appear in places like Japan and Mexico, where they don't usually happen. Understanding this helps scientists protect satellites and GPS from space weather problems.",

    "Solar storms are big events from the Sun that can cause problems on Earth. They happen when the Sun releases lots of energy and particles. Earth has a magnetic field and layers like the plasmasphere that protect us. The plasmasphere is made of charged particles and helps block harmful radiation. When a solar storm hits, it can squeeze this layer and cause issues like GPS errors or satellite damage. Scientists use satellites and ground tools to study these storms to keep technology safe."
