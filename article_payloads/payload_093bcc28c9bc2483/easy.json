  "title": "How Everyday Chemicals Can Hurt Your Tummy Bugs",
  "summary": "Scientists found that many chemicals we use every day can harm the tiny bacteria living in our guts. These bacteria help us stay healthy by digesting food and fighting germs. The study looked at over 1,000 chemicals, like pesticides from farms and chemicals in plastics. They discovered 168 of these chemicals can stop good gut bacteria from growing. This is a problem because if the bacteria get hurt, it might make us sick or cause infections that are hard to treat. The scientists made a computer tool to predict which chemicals are bad for gut bacteria, so we can make safer products in the future. They say we need to check if chemicals are safe for our gut bugs, not just for people.",

    "Gut bacteria are tiny organisms in your stomach that help you digest food, stay at a healthy weight, and fight off sickness. Chemicals are things people make, like in pesticides for farms or plastics for toys. Sometimes, these chemicals can accidentally hurt the good bacteria in your gut. Scientists study this to keep us safe and make better products that don't harm our bodies."
