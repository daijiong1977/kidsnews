  "title": "UK Plans to Spend More on Defense",
  "summary": "The UK government is thinking about spending a lot more money on defense to keep the country safe. The prime minister wants to increase defense spending to 3% of the country's economic output, which is measured by GDP. This plan might happen sooner than expected, possibly by 2029, but no final decision has been made yet. The Treasury is being careful about the costs, which could be billions of pounds extra each year. Officials say that current defense budgets are not enough to cover all the needs, so they are looking at ways to spend more money faster. The idea was discussed in a meeting with the prime minister and his advisers to figure out the best plan.",

    "The UK government uses money from taxes and other sources to pay for things like defense, which includes the army, navy, and air force to protect the country. GDP is a way to measure how well the country's economy is doing by looking at all the goods and services produced. When the government talks about spending a percentage of GDP on defense, it means they plan to use part of the country's total economic value for military purposes. This helps ensure the country is safe from threats."
