    "The Brits Awards is an annual ceremony that honors achievements in the British and international music industry, established in 1977. It features categories like album of the year and artist of the year, with performances by top artists.

This year's move to Manchester's Co-op Live Arena marked a departure from its usual London venue, reflecting efforts to decentralize cultural events. The event also highlights collaborations and trends, such as coordinated outfits and international winners, making it a significant night for music and pop culture."
