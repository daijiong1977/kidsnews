  "title": "Tiny Living Things Used Oxygen Long Ago",
  "summary": "A long time ago, Earth had no oxygen in the air. Then, tiny living things called cyanobacteria started making oxygen from sunlight and water. But oxygen did not fill the air until much later, in an event called the Great Oxidation Event. Scientists from MIT found that other tiny living things may have used oxygen even before that event. They studied an enzyme that helps living things breathe oxygen. This enzyme might have evolved hundreds of millions of years earlier than thought. If these tiny living things used oxygen as soon as it was made, it could explain why oxygen took so long to build up in the air. This shows how life can adapt and use new things early in Earth's history.",

  "background_read": [
    "Earth is very old, about 4.5 billion years. For a long time, there was no oxygen in the air. Tiny living things called microbes lived without oxygen. Then, cyanobacteria evolved and started making oxygen through photosynthesis, which uses sunlight and water. This oxygen changed Earth and allowed new kinds of life to evolve. Scientists study rocks and enzymes to learn about this early time. Understanding how oxygen built up helps us know how life on Earth developed and adapted over billions of years."
