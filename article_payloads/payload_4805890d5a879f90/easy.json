  "title": "Artists Stop Playing at Kennedy Center After Name Change",
  "summary": "The Kennedy Center is a famous arts center in the United States. Recently, its name was changed to include former President Donald Trump's name along with John F. Kennedy's. This has caused problems. Some artists, like musicians and dancers, have decided to cancel their shows there. They say they do not want to perform at a place with Trump's name because of his actions and beliefs. For example, Chuck Redd canceled a Christmas Eve concert, and other groups like The Cookers and Doug Varone and Dancers also canceled. The Kennedy Center's president threatened to sue one artist. This has led to fewer people buying tickets and watching events, like the Kennedy Center Honors on TV. The article shows how art and politics can mix, causing disagreements and changes at an important cultural place.",
