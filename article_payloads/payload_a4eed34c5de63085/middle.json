  "title": "Nightclub Fires: Lessons from Tragedies in the US and Switzerland",
  "summary": "This article examines two devastating nightclub fires: one at The Station in West Warwick, Rhode Island in 2003, and another at Le Constellation in Crans-Montana, Switzerland in 2026. Both incidents were triggered by pyrotechnic displays during concerts, which ignited acoustic foam panels on the walls, leading to rapid fire spread. In Rhode Island, 100 people died, including Fred Crisostomi who saved his fiancée Gina Russo, while in Switzerland, 40 young people lost their lives. Experts, such as fire investigation consultant Richard Hagger, highlight the role of non-fire-retardant foam in accelerating the fires, creating flashover conditions where heat and smoke spread downward. The similarities between these events raise critical questions about indoor pyrotechnics safety and emergency preparedness. Survivors' accounts emphasize the chaos and limited escape time, underscoring the need for better regulations and public awareness to prevent future tragedies.",

    "Nightclub fires are serious disasters that often result from a combination of factors like pyrotechnics, flammable materials, and poor emergency exits. The Station fire in 2003 was a landmark case in the US, leading to increased scrutiny of fire safety codes. Similarly, the 2026 Swiss fire highlights ongoing global risks. Understanding fire dynamics, such as flashovers, and the importance of fire-retardant materials can help in designing safer venues. This context is crucial for middle school students to grasp how historical events inform current safety practices and the role of experts in prevention."
