  "title": "A Fire in a Nightclub: How People Escaped",
  "summary": "This story is about two big fires in nightclubs. One happened in 2003 in Rhode Island, USA, and another in 2026 in Switzerland. In both places, people were watching a band play when fireworks on stage started a fire. The fire spread very fast because of foam on the walls. Many people tried to run out, but it was hard to find the exits. Some people got hurt or died, including a man named Fred who saved his girlfriend Gina. The fires show that using fireworks inside can be very dangerous. Experts say we need to be careful and know how to escape if a fire happens.",
