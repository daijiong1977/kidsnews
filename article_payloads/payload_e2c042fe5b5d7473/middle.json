  "summary": "Katie Boulter, the British tennis player ranked number four in her country, secured her fourth WTA Tour title by winning the Ostrava Open. In the final, she faced Tamara Korpatsch from Germany and triumphed in three sets with a score of 5-7, 6-2, 6-1, after losing the first set. This victory marks a significant comeback for Boulter, who had dropped to 120th in the world rankings but will now rise 36 places to number 84, re-entering the top 100. She dedicated the win to her new coach, Michael Joyce, whom she appointed at the start of 2026 after splitting from her previous coach. Boulter highlighted the challenges of the past year, making this trophy especially meaningful. In contrast, fellow British player Emma Raducanu lost her final at the Transylvania Open. Boulter's success in Ostrava adds to her previous titles in Nottingham and San Diego, demonstrating her resilience and skill in professional tennis.",
