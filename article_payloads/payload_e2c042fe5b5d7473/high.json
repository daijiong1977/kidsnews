  "title": "Katie Boulter's Strategic Triumph at the Ostrava Open: A Career Resurgence",
  "summary": "Katie Boulter, the British tennis professional, clinched her fourth WTA Tour title with a decisive victory at the Ostrava Open, defeating Tamara Korpatsch 5-7, 6-2, 6-1 in the final. This win represents a pivotal resurgence in Boulter's career, as she had previously fallen to 120th in the WTA rankings but will now ascend 36 places to number 84, re-establishing her position within the top 100. The match showcased Boulter's tactical adaptability, as she recovered from losing the first set and three consecutive games to dominate the latter stages. Boulter attributed her success to her new coach, Michael Joyce, appointed in early 2026 following her split from long-time coach Biljana Veselinovic, highlighting the psychological and technical adjustments in her game. In contrast, compatriot Emma Raducanu faced a defeat in the Transylvania Open final, underscoring the variability in professional tennis outcomes. Boulter's victory, her first trophy in nearly 15 months, adds to her previous titles in Nottingham and San Diego, emphasizing her consistency in finals with only one loss out of five. Her post-match reflections on the challenges of the past year underscore the personal significance of this achievement, marking a testament to resilience and strategic evolution in elite sports.",
