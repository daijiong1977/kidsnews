  "title": "How Global Warming Could Lead to an Ice Age",
  "summary": "Scientists have found a new way that Earth's climate can change. They study how rocks and oceans help control the temperature. When it gets warmer, rocks break down faster and take carbon dioxide from the air, which cools the Earth. But in the ocean, warmer weather makes tiny plants called plankton grow more. These plankton eat carbon dioxide and sink to the bottom when they die, taking carbon with them. This can make the Earth too cold, leading to an ice age. Long ago, ice ages covered almost the whole planet. The researchers think this happens because the ocean system can go too far, making it very cold instead of just balancing the temperature. This helps us understand why ancient ice ages were so extreme.",

    "Earth's climate changes over time, and scientists study how natural processes like rock weathering and ocean life help keep temperatures stable. Rock weathering involves rain breaking down rocks to absorb carbon dioxide, while plankton in the ocean do the same. Sometimes, these processes can work too well, leading to extreme cold periods called ice ages. Understanding this helps us learn about past climate events and how Earth's systems interact."
