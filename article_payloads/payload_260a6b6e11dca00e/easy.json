  "title": "MIT Makes Super Strong Aluminum with 3D Printing",
  "summary": "MIT engineers have created a new aluminum material that is five times stronger than regular aluminum. They used 3D printing to make it, which is a way to build things layer by layer with a machine. This new aluminum can handle very high heat and is very strong. It was made by mixing aluminum with other elements, and scientists used computers and machine learning to find the best recipe quickly. This material could be used to make lighter and stronger parts for airplanes, cars, and other machines, saving energy. The idea started in a class at MIT, where students tried to design a better aluminum, and later, machine learning helped improve it. This breakthrough could help make transportation more efficient.",

    "Aluminum is a common metal that is light and used in many products, but it is not always very strong. Scientists at MIT wanted to make it stronger by mixing it with other elements and using 3D printing, a modern technology. They used machine learning, which helps computers learn from data to solve problems faster. This project began in a school class where students tried to design better materials, and later, advanced tools helped create this new aluminum. Understanding this helps us see how science can improve everyday things like cars and planes."
