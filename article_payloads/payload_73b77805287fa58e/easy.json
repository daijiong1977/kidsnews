  "title": "Scientists Help Older Bodies Fight Germs Better",
  "summary": "As people get older, their immune system, which fights germs, becomes weaker. This makes them more likely to get sick. Scientists from MIT and the Broad Institute have found a new way to help. They used a special method with mRNA to make liver cells act like a tiny factory. This factory produces signals that help T cells, which are important immune cells, work better. In tests with older mice, this treatment made their T cells stronger and more varied, helping them respond better to vaccines and cancer treatments. The scientists hope this can one day help older people stay healthier by boosting their immune system. This research was published in a journal called Nature.",

    "The immune system is like a shield that protects your body from germs like bacteria and viruses. As people age, this shield can get weaker, making it harder to fight off sickness. Scientists are always looking for ways to make the immune system stronger, especially for older adults. In this study, they used a new method with mRNA, which is a tool that can tell cells what to do, to help boost the immune system in mice. This could lead to new treatments to keep people healthy as they get older."
