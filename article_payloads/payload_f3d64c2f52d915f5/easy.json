  "title": "Parents Fight to Get Their Babies Back",
  "summary": "This article tells the story of Keira, a mom from Greenland, whose baby was taken away by social services right after birth. She felt very sad and is now trying to get her child back. This happened because of special tests called FKUs that check if parents are good enough. Many Greenlandic families in Denmark face this problem. The tests include questions and tasks, but some people think they are not fair because they are in Danish, not the Greenlandic language. Recently, the Danish government stopped using these tests for Greenlandic families after many complaints. The article shows how families are fighting for their children and why the tests might be unfair.",

    "This article is about families from Greenland who live in Denmark. Greenland is a big, cold island that is part of Denmark. Social services in Denmark sometimes take children away from parents if they think the children are not safe. They use tests to decide if parents are good caregivers. Recently, people argued that these tests are not fair to Greenlandic families because the tests are in Danish, which many Greenlanders do not speak well. This can cause misunderstandings. The government stopped the tests for these families after many years of complaints. It's important to understand that all families want to care for their children, and fairness is key."
