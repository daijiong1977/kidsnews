  "title": "The Science Behind Birmingham's Pink Sky During Snowfall",
  "summary": "During a rare snowfall in the West Midlands, residents observed a mysterious pink glow in the sky, sparking speculation about vivid sunsets or the Northern Lights. However, the phenomenon was traced to practical LED lights used on football pitches at St Andrew's in Birmingham and in Hednesford. These lights are employed to aid grass growth and recovery for sports. Meteorologist Simon King explained that atmospheric conditions, including low cloud cover and falling snow, enhanced the reflectivity of the sky, allowing the light from these sources to create a visible pink hue. This event highlights how human activities, combined with specific weather patterns, can produce unexpected visual effects, debunking initial supernatural theories. The article underscores the intersection of technology, meteorology, and urban environments in shaping natural appearances.",
