  "title": "A Pink Sky Mystery in Birmingham",
  "summary": "In Birmingham, when it snowed one evening, people saw a pink glow in the sky. They wondered if it was a pretty sunset or the Northern Lights. But it was actually from LED lights on a football pitch at St Andrew's, where Birmingham City plays. The lights help the grass grow. The snow and clouds made the sky reflect the light, turning it pink. Other places like Hednesford also saw this because of their football lights. It was a fun surprise, not something magical.",
