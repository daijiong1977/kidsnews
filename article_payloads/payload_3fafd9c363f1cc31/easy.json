  "title": "A Cool New Tool Helps Scientists See Space Ripples Better",
  "summary": "Scientists have made a new tool called FROSTI that helps LIGO, a special observatory, see gravitational waves better. Gravitational waves are tiny ripples in space made by big things like black holes crashing together. LIGO uses lasers and mirrors to detect these waves, but sometimes the lasers heat the mirrors and make them wobbly, which hides the waves. FROSTI fixes this by warming the mirrors in a controlled way to keep them smooth. This lets LIGO use stronger lasers without problems, so it can see more black holes and neutron stars far away in space. The tool was made by physicist Jonathan Richardson and his team, and it might be used in future observatories like Cosmic Explorer to explore the universe deeper.",

    "Gravitational waves are like ripples in a pond but in space, caused by big things like black holes or neutron stars crashing. LIGO is a special machine with lasers and mirrors that can feel these ripples, helping scientists learn about space. Sometimes, the lasers heat the mirrors and make them wobbly, so FROSTI was invented to warm the mirrors gently and keep them smooth, allowing LIGO to see more waves from far away."
