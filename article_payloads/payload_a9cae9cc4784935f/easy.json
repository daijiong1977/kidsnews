  "title": "Chickens Think Bouba Sounds Round Too!",
  "summary": "Have you ever heard the made-up words \"bouba\" and \"kiki\"? People often think \"bouba\" sounds round and soft, while \"kiki\" sounds sharp and spiky. This is called the bouba/kiki effect. Scientists wondered if this is just a human thing or if animals feel it too. They tested baby chickens that were only one to three days old. The chickens heard recordings of a person saying \"bouba\" or \"kiki\" and saw round and spiky shapes. Most chickens went to the round shape when they heard \"bouba\" and to the spiky shape with \"kiki.\" This shows that even animals like chickens can link sounds to shapes, not just humans. It might be because our brains connect different senses, like hearing and seeing. The study helps us learn how animals and people understand the world in similar ways.",

    "The bouba/kiki effect is a fun idea where people connect sounds like \"bouba\" to round shapes and \"kiki\" to spiky ones, even though these aren't real words. Scientists have studied this for years to see if it's only humans or if animals do it too. In this experiment, they used baby chickens because they are young and can move around easily. By playing recordings and showing shapes, they found chickens also link \"bouba\" to round and \"kiki\" to spiky. This helps us understand how brains work across different species, showing we might share some basic ways of thinking with animals."
