  "summary": "President Zelenskyy of Ukraine says a security agreement with the United States is ready to be signed. This deal is meant to help protect Ukraine from Russia, which invaded Ukraine almost four years ago. Zelenskyy talked about this in Lithuania and said they are waiting for a date to sign it. After signing, the agreement will go to the U.S. Congress and Ukraine's parliament for approval. He also wants Ukraine to join the European Union by 2027 for economic safety. Talks happened in Abu Dhabi with people from Ukraine, the U.S., and Russia, including military representatives, to try to end the war. Zelenskyy said there are big differences with Russia, especially about Ukraine's land. More talks are planned for February 1. The talks also discussed a possible ceasefire and issues about a nuclear power plant in Ukraine that Russia controls.",

    "Ukraine is a country in Europe that has been at war with Russia since 2022, when Russia invaded. A security agreement is a promise between countries to help protect each other. The European Union is a group of European countries that cooperate on things like trade and safety. Talks are meetings where leaders try to solve problems and make peace. A ceasefire means stopping fighting for a while, which can help people stay safe during wars. Parliaments are groups that vote on laws and agreements in countries like the U.S. and Ukraine."
