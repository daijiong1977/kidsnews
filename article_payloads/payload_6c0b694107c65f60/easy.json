  "title": "Sperm Donors and Many Kids",
  "summary": "Some men give their sperm to help women have babies when they can't on their own, like if they don't have a partner or their partner can't have kids. This is called sperm donation. The BBC found one man who had 197 children from his sperm, which was sent to 14 countries. This shows how big the sperm donor business is. Sperm donation is a big industry, especially in Denmark, where it's very popular. Not all men can be donors because their sperm needs to be very healthy. Doctors check if the sperm can swim well and survive freezing. Only a few men pass these tests, so there aren't many donors. Because of this, some donors have lots of children to meet the demand. This can be a problem if the sperm has genetic issues, like raising cancer risk, as seen in one case.",

    "Sperm donation helps women become mothers when they face challenges like infertility or being in same-sex relationships. It's a growing industry, with countries like Denmark leading in exports. Donors must pass strict health checks, making them rare, which leads to some donors fathering many children. This raises concerns about genetic risks and the need for regulation."
