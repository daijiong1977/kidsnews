  "title": "Paying to See the Trevi Fountain in Rome",
  "summary": "In Rome, Italy, tourists will soon need to pay €2 to get close to the famous Trevi Fountain starting in February 2026. This fee helps the city take care of the fountain and manage the many visitors. The mayor says it will make things less crowded. People can still see the fountain for free from far away. Kids under five and some others don't have to pay. The money from the fee will go to the city, not to charity like the coins thrown in the water. This is part of a new plan for some places in Rome where locals get free entry but tourists pay.",
