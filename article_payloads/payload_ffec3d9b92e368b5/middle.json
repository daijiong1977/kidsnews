  "title": "Rome Implements €2 Fee for Trevi Fountain Access to Manage Tourism",
  "summary": "Starting February 1, 2026, tourists in Rome will be required to pay a €2 entrance fee to access the Trevi Fountain up close, as part of a new tariff system for certain monuments. The fee aims to generate €6.5 million annually for the city to fund upkeep and manage visitor flows, reducing chaos around the Baroque landmark. Mayor Roberto Gualtieri announced the move, emphasizing that the small charge will help control crowds, with the fountain currently attracting 30,000 daily visitors. Exemptions include children under five and individuals with disabilities, while residents gain free entry to other sites like the Sacred Area of Largo Argentina. Tourists can still view the fountain for free from a distance, and the city has implemented a queuing system capping access at 400 people at a time after recent restoration work. This policy reflects broader efforts to balance tourism revenue with preservation and local benefits.",

    "Rome is a major tourist destination with iconic sites like the Trevi Fountain, a Baroque masterpiece from the 18th century designed by Nicola Salvi. Tourism brings economic benefits but also challenges such as overcrowding and wear on historical monuments. Cities worldwide are adopting fees and management strategies to preserve heritage while accommodating visitors. The Trevi Fountain's coins are traditionally thrown for luck and donated to charity, but entrance fees represent a shift toward direct funding for maintenance. Understanding urban tourism management helps in analyzing policies like Rome's new tariff system."
