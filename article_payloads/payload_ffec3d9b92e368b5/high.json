  "title": "Analyzing Rome's €2 Trevi Fountain Fee: Tourism Management and Urban Policy",
  "summary": "Rome will introduce a €2 entrance fee for close proximity to the Trevi Fountain effective February 1, 2026, as part of a broader tariff system targeting tourists at select monuments. This policy, announced by Mayor Roberto Gualtieri, aims to alleviate overtourism by generating an estimated €6.5 million annually for upkeep and visitor management, with the fountain currently experiencing 30,000 daily visitors. Exemptions apply to children under five and disabled individuals, while residents gain complimentary access to other sites such as the Sacred Area of Largo Argentina, illustrating a dual approach to revenue generation and equity. The city has implemented a queuing system capping concurrent access at 400 people following restoration, reflecting strategic crowd control measures. This initiative underscores urban challenges in balancing preservation of Baroque heritage, designed by Nicola Salvi in the 18th century, with sustainable tourism economics, highlighting global trends in destination management.",

    "The Trevi Fountain, an 18th-century Baroque work by Nicola Salvi, symbolizes Rome's rich cultural heritage and attracts millions of tourists annually, contributing to overtourism challenges. Urban policies like entrance fees are increasingly adopted worldwide to mitigate congestion, fund preservation, and enhance visitor experiences, as seen in cities like Venice and Barcelona. This article situates Rome's fee within broader discourses on sustainable tourism, equity in access, and the economic valuation of cultural assets. Understanding these concepts requires knowledge of tourism economics, heritage management, and urban planning principles."
