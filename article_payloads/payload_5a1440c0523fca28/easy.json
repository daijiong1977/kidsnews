  "title": "Cats and Humans: A Late Friendship",
  "summary": "Cats are popular pets today, but they didn't always live with people. Scientists found out that cats started becoming friends with humans only about 3,500 to 4,000 years ago, which is much later than we thought. This happened in northern Africa, not in other places like the Levant. Before that, cats were wild animals called African wildcats. People in ancient Egypt loved cats and made art about them. Cats helped by catching pests on ships and in homes, which helped them spread to Europe and other parts of the world with travelers like the Romans. Now, cats live everywhere except Antarctica. It's interesting that in China, a wild cat was with people even before domestic cats arrived. This study used old cat bones and DNA to learn these new facts.",

    "Cats are common pets now, but they were once wild. Scientists study old bones and DNA to learn how animals change over time. Domestication means animals become friendly with humans. In history, people in Egypt loved cats and made statues of them. Cats traveled with people to new places, helping control pests. This helps us understand how animals and humans have lived together for thousands of years."
