  "title": "Mars Lakes Stayed Liquid Under Ice",
  "summary": "Scientists found that small lakes on Mars long ago could have stayed liquid for many years, even though it was very cold. They used a special computer model to study this. The model showed that lakes near Mars' equator, like in Gale Crater, might have had a thin layer of ice on top that melted in warmer seasons. This ice acted like a blanket, keeping the water underneath from freezing completely. The research helps explain how water could exist on Mars without it being warm. This is important because we see signs of old lakes on Mars, but it was thought to be too cold. The study was done by researchers from Rice University and published in a science journal.",

    "Mars is a cold, dry planet with signs of ancient water, like dried-up lake beds. Scientists have wondered how liquid water could exist there long ago when it was freezing. This study uses a model to show that thin ice might have kept lakes liquid, helping us understand Mars' past and search for life."
