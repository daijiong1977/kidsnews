  "title": "Trump Reverses Key Climate Rule: The Endangerment Finding",
  "summary": "President Donald Trump has revoked the 2009 'endangerment finding,' a landmark scientific ruling by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) that declared greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide and methane a threat to public health. This finding served as the legal foundation for federal regulations aimed at reducing emissions from vehicles, power plants, and other sectors. Trump argues that reversing this rule will save over $1 trillion, lower car prices by $2,400 per vehicle, and benefit the auto industry, calling it the 'largest deregulation in American history.' However, environmental groups strongly oppose the move, labeling it a significant rollback on climate change efforts and planning legal challenges. Former President Barack Obama criticized the decision, stating it will make Americans more vulnerable to health risks and climate impacts. The endangerment finding was crucial during Obama's administration as Congress was divided on climate legislation, allowing the EPA to implement emission controls. Experts note that this reversal could weaken various environmental standards across multiple industries.",

    "The endangerment finding was established in 2009 by the Environmental Protection Agency under President Obama, following scientific evidence that greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide and methane pose significant risks to public health and welfare. This ruling became a critical legal tool for implementing federal climate policies, especially as the U.S. Congress was gridlocked on passing comprehensive climate legislation. It enabled regulations across various sectors, including vehicle emissions standards and controls on power plants. The finding is based on the Clean Air Act, which allows the EPA to regulate pollutants that endanger health. Trump's reversal marks a major shift in U.S. environmental policy, emphasizing economic benefits over climate concerns, and has sparked debates about the balance between industry growth and environmental protection."
