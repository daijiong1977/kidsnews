  "title": "President Trump Changes a Big Rule About Air Pollution",
  "summary": "President Donald Trump has changed an important rule from when President Obama was in charge. The rule, called the 'endangerment finding,' said that greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide are bad for people's health. This rule helped the government make laws to reduce pollution from cars and factories. Trump says getting rid of this rule will make cars cheaper and help the auto industry. But many people who care about the environment are upset. They say this change will hurt our health and make climate change worse. They plan to fight it in court. Obama also spoke against the change, saying it will make Americans less safe. The rule was made by the Environmental Protection Agency in 2009 and was used to control pollution from many sources.",

  "background_read": [
    "In 2009, the U.S. government made a rule called the 'endangerment finding' because scientists found that greenhouse gases, like carbon dioxide from cars and factories, are harmful to people's health. This rule allowed the government to create laws to reduce these gases and fight climate change. It affected many things, such as how cars are made and how power plants operate. Recently, President Trump decided to remove this rule, saying it will help businesses and lower costs, but others worry it will lead to more pollution and health problems."
