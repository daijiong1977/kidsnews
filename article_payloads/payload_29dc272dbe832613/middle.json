  "title": "Royal Family's Christmas Tradition at Sandringham",
  "summary": "On Christmas Day, the Royal Family, led by King Charles and Queen Camilla, attended a church service at St Mary Magdalene Church in Sandringham, Norfolk. This event is a significant tradition in the royal calendar, bringing together members such as Prince William, Catherine, and their children, along with other relatives like Princess Beatrice and Princess Eugenie. Excited crowds from the UK, Europe, and the United States gathered, some queuing from Christmas Eve, to witness the public appearance. The service was relayed by speakers to those outside, and afterwards, the royals planned to spend Christmas at their Sandringham estate, a customary meeting place since 1988. Additionally, King Charles was set to deliver his Christmas message later in the day, filmed at Westminster Abbey, following his recent positive news about cancer treatment. The event highlights the family's role in public life and their holiday rituals.",
