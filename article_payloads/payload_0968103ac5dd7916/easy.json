  "title": "BBC Wants to Stop Trump's Big Lawsuit",
  "summary": "The BBC is asking a court to dismiss a lawsuit from Donald Trump, who was the US president. Trump sued the BBC for $5 billion because he says a TV show edited his speech in a way that made him look bad. The BBC apologized for the edit but says it didn't break any laws. They argue that the court in Florida doesn't have power over them because they are a British company and the show wasn't shown in the US. They also say Trump wasn't hurt by the show because he won an election after it aired. The show, called Panorama, cut parts of Trump's speech about going to the Capitol, making it seem like he called for violence, but the BBC says it was a mistake and not meant to harm him. They want the court to stop the lawsuit before it goes further.",

    "This article is about a legal fight between Donald Trump, a former US president, and the BBC, a British TV company. Trump gave a speech on January 6, 2021, before a riot at the US Capitol. The BBC made a TV show called Panorama that edited parts of his speech, making it seem like he called for violence. Trump sued the BBC for a lot of money, saying this hurt his reputation. The BBC says sorry for the edit but argues it didn't do anything illegal and wants the court to stop the lawsuit. Understanding this helps learn about media, law, and how speeches can be changed in videos."
