  "summary": "Donald Glover, who is also known as Childish Gambino, is a famous actor and rapper. During a concert in Los Angeles, he told the audience that he had a stroke last year. A stroke is when blood flow to part of the brain stops, which can cause problems like not being able to see well. Glover had to cancel his tour because of this health issue. He felt sad about letting his fans down, especially since he promised to perform in Ireland. Doctors also found a hole in his heart, so he needed surgeries. Glover shared that this experience made him realize how precious life is and to appreciate every moment with his fans.",
