  "title": "Bird Flu Alert: Expert Warns Farmers",
  "summary": "A bird flu virus is spreading in the UK, and an expert says it could be the worst one yet. Bird flu is a sickness that affects birds like chickens and ducks, and it can sometimes spread to people. The expert is worried because the virus might change and become even more dangerous. Farmers are being told to watch their birds closely and keep them safe. This is important because if the virus spreads, it could make many birds sick and affect the food supply. Everyone should wash their hands and avoid touching sick birds to stay healthy. The government is working to stop the spread and protect both birds and people.",

    "Bird flu, or avian influenza, is a disease that mostly affects birds but can sometimes infect humans. It spreads through contact with sick birds or their droppings. In the past, outbreaks have led to the culling of many birds to prevent spread. Experts study viruses to understand how they change and become more dangerous. Farmers play a key role in monitoring and protecting their flocks to ensure food safety and public health."
