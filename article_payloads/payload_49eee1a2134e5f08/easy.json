  "title": "Paramount Wants to Buy Warner Bros and Beat Netflix",
  "summary": "Paramount, a big movie company, is trying to buy Warner Bros, another big movie company. Warner Bros was going to sell part of itself to Netflix, but Paramount made a better offer. Paramount offered more money per share, which means they want to pay more to own Warner Bros. Warner Bros is now talking to Paramount to see if this new deal is better than the one with Netflix. Netflix has four days to make a new offer if they want to compete. Some people in government are worried because big companies buying each other might not be good for competition. This is like a big game where companies try to buy each other to become stronger in Hollywood.",

    "In the entertainment world, big companies like Paramount, Warner Bros, and Netflix make movies and shows for people to watch. Sometimes, these companies try to buy each other to get bigger and have more control. This is called a takeover bid. When one company offers more money, it can change the deal. People in government watch these deals to make sure no company gets too powerful, which could hurt competition and choices for viewers."
