  "title": "Bigfoot Hunters: Why People Search for a Mystery Creature",
  "summary": "Some people called Bigfooters spend time looking for Bigfoot, a big, hairy creature that many think is not real. In 1967, a famous film showed something like Bigfoot in the woods, and it became popular in movies and emojis. Researchers Jamie Lewis and Andrew Bartlett wanted to know why Bigfooters search for this creature. They talked to over 130 Bigfooters during lockdown and wrote a book about it. Bigfooters have different ideas: some think Bigfoot is an unknown animal, while others think it might be from another dimension. Many Americans believe Bigfoot could exist. The researchers found that Bigfooters are often men who live in rural areas and might have been in the military. They study this community to understand why people are so interested in Bigfoot, even without proof.",
