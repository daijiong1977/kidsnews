  "title": "Austrian Duo Triumphs in Olympic Team Combined Skiing",
  "summary": "At the Milan Cortina Olympic Games in Italy, Austrian skiers Ariane Raedler and Katharina Huber secured a gold medal in the newly introduced team combined event. This event combines one downhill run and one slalom run, with times added together for a team score. Despite their lack of World Cup victories, the Austrian pair outperformed competitors, including the highly decorated American skier Mikaela Shiffrin, who finished fourth. Shiffrin, holder of 108 World Cup wins, has now gone seven consecutive Olympic races without a medal, following her earlier successes. Germany's Kira Weidle-Winkelmann and Emma Aicher earned silver, while Americans Paula Moltzan and Jacqueline Wiles took bronze. The race highlighted surprises in Olympic outcomes, with Shiffrin losing time during her run and missing a medal by a narrow margin. She still has individual events ahead, offering a chance for redemption. The article emphasizes the unpredictability of sports and the emergence of new champions.",
