  "title": "How Thieves Tricked People at the Louvre Museum",
  "summary": "In October 2025, four men stole valuable jewels from the Louvre Museum in Paris. They wore bright vests like construction workers and used a furniture lift, so no one noticed them. This happened because people often ignore things that look normal. The article explains that this idea also applies to AI, which is a type of smart computer. AI can make similar mistakes by not seeing things that don't fit its learned patterns. Understanding this helps us see how both humans and AI can be tricked by appearances.",
