  "title": "Stranger Things Drives Music Chart Success for 1980s Hits",
  "summary": "Joe Keery, known for his role as Steve Harrington in Stranger Things and his musical alias Djo, has achieved number one in the UK charts with his song End of Beginning. Originally released in 2022, the song peaked at number four earlier in 2024 but surged to the top spot following the finale of Stranger Things' fifth season. This success is partly due to viral trends on TikTok, where fans created edits using the song. Additionally, classic 1980s tracks featured in the show, such as Prince's Purple Rain and Kate Bush's Running Up That Hill, have re-entered the top 20, demonstrating the series' significant impact on music consumption. According to the Official Charts Company, End of Beginning was streamed 5.4 million times in the UK this week and over 55 million times globally on Spotify, dethroning Taylor Swift's song. Experts like Sarah Kloboves note that TikTok leverages nostalgia to engage diverse audiences, with older songs appealing to both sentimental older listeners and younger users discovering them for the first time. This trend highlights how media and social platforms can revive older music, broadening its reach.",
