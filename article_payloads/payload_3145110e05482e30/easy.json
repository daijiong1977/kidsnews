  "title": "Trot Music: From Old to New Again",
  "summary": "Trot is a type of Korean music that started a long time ago and was very popular. It has a special rhythm and singers often wear shiny suits and big hair. People used to think it was old-fashioned, but now it is becoming popular again. This is because people on social media are using AI to change K-pop songs into trot style. They make videos with AI pictures of singers, and many people watch these videos. Trot songs often talk about sad feelings like missing home or love. Some famous old singers like Nam Jin and Na Hoon-A made trot famous in the past. Today, new singers are trying to bring trot back through TV shows where they compete to be stars.",
