  "title": "Online Behavior: Not as Mean as You Think",
  "summary": "Many people think the internet is full of mean comments, but it's not as bad as they believe. For example, on Reddit, Americans guess that 43% of users post very toxic comments, but research shows it's only about 3%. This means people overestimate how common bad behavior is online. Researchers studied this by asking over 1,000 adults what they think about online toxicity and comparing it to real data. They found that people often think toxic posts are much more common than they actually are, like on Facebook where they guess 47% share false news, but it's really 8.5%. This mistake can make people feel sad about society. Even when people can spot mean posts, they still think many users make them. The study also showed that telling people the truth about how rare toxicity is can make them feel more hopeful and less worried about society. Most toxic content comes from a small group of very active users, not everyone, so remembering this can help people feel better about using the internet.",
