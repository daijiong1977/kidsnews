  "title": "Tennis Player Says Sport Has Mean Culture",
  "summary": "Destanee Aiava, a tennis player from Australia, has decided to stop playing tennis at age 25. She says tennis has a culture that is racist, misogynistic, homophobic, and hostile. Racist means treating people unfairly because of their race, misogynistic means being unfair to women, and homophobic means being unfair to people who are gay. Aiava compared tennis to a 'toxic boyfriend,' which means it was harmful and made her feel bad. She talked about getting mean messages online from trolls, which are people who say hurtful things on the internet. Other players like Katie Boulter have also faced this problem. Aiava is grateful for her travels and friends but feels tennis took away her health and self-worth. She hopes to start fresh and find something she loves.",
