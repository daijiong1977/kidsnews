  "title": "Tennis Player Retires, Criticizing Sport's Culture as Harmful",
  "summary": "Destanee Aiava, a 25-year-old Australian tennis player of Samoan descent, has announced her retirement, citing a 'racist, misogynistic, homophobic and hostile' culture within tennis. She compared the sport to a 'toxic boyfriend,' highlighting its damaging effects on her well-being. Aiava reached a career-high singles ranking of 147 but decided to leave due to persistent issues, including online abuse from trolls. She shared that she received hate or death threats and negative comments about her body and career. This problem is not isolated; British player Katie Boulter has also spoken out about online abuse, and data from organizations like Signify, ITF, and WTA shows thousands of abusive messages sent to tennis players in 2024, often linked to betting. Aiava criticized tennis for hiding behind traditions of class and gentlemanly values while fostering a culture that excludes those who don't fit the mold. Despite gratitude for travel and friendships, she felt tennis took away her relationship with her body, health, family, and self-worth. She expressed uncertainty about repeating her career but emphasized the chance to start fresh. Tennis officials have not yet responded to her statements.",
