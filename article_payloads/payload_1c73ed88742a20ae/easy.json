  "title": "Court Protects Money for Science Research",
  "summary": "A court said the government cannot cut money that helps universities pay for research costs. This money is called indirect costs, and it covers things like electricity, building repairs, and animal care in labs. The Trump administration wanted to change the rules to give all universities the same small amount, but many universities said this would hurt their research. States and schools sued to stop the change. A lower court blocked it, and now an appeals court agreed because Congress had already made a rule to prevent such cuts. This means universities can keep getting the money they need unless the Supreme Court decides differently. The court said the government's plan was unfair and did not follow the law.",

    "Indirect costs are extra money that universities get when researchers receive grants. This money helps pay for things not directly part of the research, like keeping lights on or fixing buildings. Different universities have different costs, so they negotiate rates with the government. Cutting this money suddenly could make it hard for schools to do science projects."
