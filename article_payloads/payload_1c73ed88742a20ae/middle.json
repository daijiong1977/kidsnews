  "title": "Appeals Court Upholds Protection of University Research Funding",
  "summary": "An appeals court has ruled that the Trump administration cannot impose a flat 15% rate on indirect costs for university research funding, upholding a lower court's injunction. Indirect costs cover expenses like utilities, facility maintenance, and animal care that support research but are not directly tied to specific projects. The administration's policy aimed to standardize these rates across all universities, but critics argued it would severely impact institutions, especially those in high-cost areas where rates often exceed 50%. States and university organizations sued, claiming the change violated legal procedures and was arbitrary. The district court blocked the policy, citing violations of the Administrative Procedures Act and existing health department rules. On appeal, the court found that Congress had already prohibited such actions through a budget rider passed in 2017 and renewed since, specifically to prevent similar attempts by the Trump administration. The judges noted the policy's broad application and inconsistent arguments by the NIH, concluding it was unlawful. This decision maintains the current negotiation-based system for indirect costs unless the Supreme Court reviews the case.",

    "Indirect costs are a critical part of research funding, reimbursing universities for overhead expenses like building maintenance, utilities, and administrative support. These costs are negotiated between institutions and funding agencies like the NIH, with rates often reflecting local economic conditions. The Trump administration's proposal to impose a uniform 15% rate sparked legal challenges, as it deviated from established procedures and threatened financial stability for research-intensive universities. This case highlights tensions between government cost-cutting measures and the need for sustainable research infrastructure, with courts intervening to uphold legislative intent and procedural fairness."
