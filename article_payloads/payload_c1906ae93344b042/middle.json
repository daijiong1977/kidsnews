His family announced his peaceful death via social media, highlighting his courage and grace. Diagnosed in late 2023, he publicly disclosed his condition in November 2024. Van Der Beek, a father of six, had a successful career in the late 1990s and early 2000s, starring in shows like Dawson's Creek and films such as Varsity Blues.

Post-diagnosis, he advocated for early cancer screening to prevent others from similar hardships. His fame peaked in the late 1990s and 2000s, with additional roles in Don't Trust the B---- in Apartment 23 and Dancing with the Stars.

    "James Van Der Beek was a prominent American actor who rose to fame in the late 1990s with his role in Dawson's Creek, a TV show that defined teen drama for many viewers. He also appeared in films like Varsity Blues and later took on diverse roles in television. Bowel cancer, specifically colorectal cancer, is a common malignancy that develops from polyps in the colon's lining and can be fatal if not detected early. Symptoms include changes in bowel habits, and screening methods like colonoscopies are crucial for early intervention. Van Der Beek's personal experience with stage three cancer, where it spread to lymph nodes, underscores the aggressive nature of the disease. His advocacy work post-diagnosis highlights the importance of public health campaigns in reducing cancer mortality through increased awareness and screening. The article references the Cleveland Clinic to provide medical context, noting that early detection saves lives, especially as men are more susceptible to this cancer type."
