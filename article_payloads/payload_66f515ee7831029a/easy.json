  "title": "A Skating Cameraman at the Olympics",
  "summary": "Jordan Cowan is a special cameraman who skates on the ice at the Olympics. He used to be a competitive ice dancer in the U.S. Now, he wears a white tuxedo and skates backward to film figure skaters right after their performances. This helps capture their happy or sad feelings up close for people watching on TV or in the arena. He is the first person to do this job at the Olympics for figure skating. For example, when American skater Ilia Malinin did well, he punched the camera in excitement. When he made a mistake, Cowan stayed back to give him space. Cowan started his company, On Ice Perspectives, in 2018 to make fun skating videos. At the Milan Cortina Winter Games, he works for the Olympic Broadcasting Services to share footage with broadcasters. Skaters often make heart signs or talk to him because he has a microphone, making it a special moment.",
