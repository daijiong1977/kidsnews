  "title": "Innovative Filming: The On-Ice Cameraman at the Olympics",
  "summary": "Jordan Cowan is a pioneering camera operator who brings a unique perspective to Olympic figure skating coverage. As a former U.S. competitive ice dancer, he skates backward on the ice after performances to capture raw emotional moments of triumph and defeat for global broadcast. Dressed in an ice-white tuxedo to blend in, he works for the Olympic Broadcasting Services at the Milan Cortina Winter Games, providing footage to national broadcasters. Cowan's role is delicate; for instance, after American skater Ilia Malinin's successful long program, Malinin punched the camera in excitement, but after a botched free skate, Cowan maintained distance to respect the skater's disappointment. This approach allows intimate access that overhead or sideboard cameras cannot achieve. Cowan founded his company, On Ice Perspectives, in 2018 to create viral skating videos and inspire amateur participation, similar to how television influenced ballroom dancing. He has filmed events like U.S. Championships and world exhibitions, and skaters often engage with him by making heart signs or sending messages via his microphone, enhancing the viewer experience. His work helps humanize athletes and adds a new dimension to sports broadcasting.",
