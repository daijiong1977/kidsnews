  "summary": "Margot Robbie and Jacob Elordi are actors in a new movie called Wuthering Heights. They play characters who are in love in the story. While talking about the movie, they have said nice things about each other, like calling it a 'mutual obsession.' Some fans think this is fun and exciting, but others feel it is 'weird' or gives them 'the ick,' which means it makes them uncomfortable. People wonder if the actors are just being friendly or if they are doing this to help promote the movie. The article looks at what they have said and done, like giving roses on Valentine's Day, to see if it is real or just for publicity. It also mentions other movies where actors might have done similar things to get attention.",
