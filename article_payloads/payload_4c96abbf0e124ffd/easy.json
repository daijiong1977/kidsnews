  "title": "More Breast Cancer in Young Women: A Surprising Health Story",
  "summary": "Doctors found that many young women are getting breast cancer, which is a serious disease. In a study from New York, about one out of every four breast cancers was in women aged 18 to 49 over 11 years. Most of these cancers were invasive, meaning they can spread, and some were aggressive types that are harder to treat. The research shows that younger women often have more severe cancers, even though there are no screening rules for them yet. Experts say doctors should check young women's risk to see if they need early screening. This is important because current guidelines only start screening at age 40 or 45 for most women, leaving a gap for younger patients.",

    "Breast cancer is a disease where cells in the breast grow out of control. It can happen to women of any age, but it's more common in older women. Screening tests like mammograms help find cancer early when it's easier to treat. Currently, doctors usually start screening women at age 40 or 45, but this study found that many younger women are getting cancer too, and their cancers are often more serious. This means we might need to change the rules to help young women stay healthy."
