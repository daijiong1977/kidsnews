  "title": "NASA Adjusts Artemis Programme with New Mission Before Moon Landing",
  "summary": "NASA has announced a significant change to its Artemis programme by adding an extra mission before attempting to land astronauts on the Moon. Originally, Artemis II was scheduled to fly around the Moon in April, followed by Artemis III for a lunar landing in 2028. Now, Artemis III will be redirected to low-Earth orbit in 2027 to practice docking with a lunar lander, while NASA maintains its goal of achieving one or two lunar landings by 2028 through Artemis IV and V. NASA administrator Jared Isaacman explained that this additional step aims to reduce long gaps between launches and test integrated systems, such as the Orion capsule and lunar lander, in a safer environment. The update also addresses delays in Artemis II due to a helium leak on the Space Launch System rocket, which is being repaired with a potential launch in April. This strategic shift emphasizes risk reduction and technological validation to enhance the programme's success.",

    "The Artemis programme is NASA's ambitious plan to land the first woman and next man on the Moon by the late 2020s, building on the legacy of the Apollo missions. It involves multiple components, including the Space Launch System rocket, Orion spacecraft, and lunar landers developed with commercial partners. Low-Earth orbit serves as a testing ground for critical technologies, such as docking and life support systems, before venturing to the Moon. Historical context includes the last crewed Moon landing in 1972, and current efforts focus on sustainable exploration and preparing for future Mars missions. Delays, like the helium leak, are common in complex space projects due to technical challenges and safety protocols."
