  "title": "NASA Changes Plans for Moon Landing",
  "summary": "NASA is changing its plans to send astronauts back to the Moon. They are adding an extra mission before landing on the Moon. The original plan was to fly around the Moon with Artemis II and then land with Artemis III in 2028. Now, Artemis III will go to low-Earth orbit in 2027 to practice docking with a lunar lander. NASA says this will not slow down the Moon landing, which is still planned for 2028 with Artemis IV and V. The extra mission helps test technology and reduce risks. NASA also updated the Artemis II mission, which was delayed due to a helium leak on the rocket. The rocket is being repaired, and the launch might happen in April. NASA wants to avoid long gaps between missions to make the program safer and more successful.",

    "NASA is working on the Artemis programme to send astronauts back to the Moon for the first time since 1972. This program includes several missions with rockets and spacecraft. The Moon is about 384,400 kilometers away from Earth. Low-Earth orbit is much closer, about 160 to 2,000 kilometers above Earth, where many satellites and the International Space Station fly. Testing in low-Earth orbit helps make space missions safer by practicing before going farther."
