  "title": "President Trump Says PBS and NPR Waste Money",
  "summary": "President Donald Trump said that PBS and NPR are a waste of money. He made this comment before signing a bill to fund the government. Last year, he helped cut funding for public media like PBS and NPR. This caused some problems, like layoffs and changes at stations. But PBS and NPR still show news and other programs on TV, radio, and online. Trump has said negative things about these networks before, like claiming they were closed, which was not true. The funding cut affected an organization called CPB that gives money to public media.",

    "Public media like PBS and NPR are TV and radio networks that get some money from the government to share news, education, and entertainment. They help people learn and stay informed. Sometimes, leaders like President Trump disagree about how much money they should get.
