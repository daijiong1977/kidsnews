  "title": "Pothole Problems: More People Asking for Money",
  "summary": "In Britain, many drivers are having trouble with potholes, which are holes in the road. A group called the RAC found that from 2021 to 2024, the number of people asking councils for money to fix their cars went up by 90%. That means almost twice as many people made claims. But in 2024, only about one out of four people got paid, and they got around £390 on average. The RAC says fixing a car from pothole damage can cost about £590. Councils say they don't have enough money to fix all the roads, but the government is spending billions to help. Potholes can damage cars and be dangerous for everyone on the road.",

    "Potholes are holes in roads that happen when weather and cars wear them down. In Britain, local councils are responsible for fixing roads, but they often don't have enough money. Drivers can ask for money, called claims, if potholes damage their cars. The RAC is a group that helps drivers and looks at road safety. This article talks about how many people are making claims and how councils are trying to fix the problem."
