  "title": "Timothée Chalamet Collaborates with EsDeeKid to Debunk Alter-Ego Speculation",
  "summary": "Timothée Chalamet, an Oscar-nominated actor, has addressed widespread rumors suggesting he is the anonymous rapper EsDeeKid by releasing a collaborative video. Speculation arose due to perceived similarities in their eyes, as EsDeeKid typically wears a mask revealing only his eyes. Chalamet initially responded with 'No comment' when questioned by the BBC, fueling further curiosity. To definitively quash the theories, he posted a video on social media featuring himself rapping alongside EsDeeKid on a remix of the track '4Raws'. In the video, Chalamet cleverly references the rumors by starting with only his eyes visible, mimicking EsDeeKid's style, before revealing his face and delivering lyrics that confirm his identity and mention his partner Kylie Jenner. Filmed at a north London convenience store, the clip was reposted by EsDeeKid and quickly went viral, with reactions from artists like Central Cee and Tinie Tempah. This collaboration also served as promotional content for Chalamet's new film, 'Marty Supreme', highlighting a savvy marketing strategy. The article notes that the idea of them being the same person was always unlikely, given differences such as EsDeeKid's Liverpudlian accent.",
