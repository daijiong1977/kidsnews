  "title": "U.S. Military Flies a Small Nuclear Reactor for the First Time",
  "summary": "The U.S. military and Energy Department flew a small nuclear reactor from California to Utah for the first time. This reactor is tiny, about the size of a minivan, and does not have nuclear fuel yet. The flight shows that the U.S. wants to use nuclear power quickly for the military and for places like data centers that need lots of electricity. President Trump supports nuclear energy because it is clean and reliable, but some people worry it might not be safe or cheap. The leaders who flew with the reactor say this is a big step to make nuclear power faster and easier to use in the future.",

    "Nuclear power is a way to make electricity without burning coal or oil, which can pollute the air. Small reactors, called microreactors, are being tested to see if they can provide power quickly for places like military bases or big computer centers. The U.S. government is trying to make it easier to use these reactors, but some experts are concerned about safety and cost. This article talks about a recent test flight to show how fast nuclear power can be moved and used."
