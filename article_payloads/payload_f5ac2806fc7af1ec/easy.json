  "title": "Bonnie Tyler's Big Song Hits a Billion Streams",
  "summary": "Bonnie Tyler is a singer from Wales who became famous in the 1980s with her song 'Total Eclipse of the Heart.' This song is very popular and has been played over one billion times on Spotify, which is a music streaming service. Even though many people listen to it, Bonnie says she makes almost no money from these streams. She grew up in a small town called Neath and loved music from a young age. A talent scout discovered her, and she released her first song in 1977. 'Total Eclipse of the Heart' changed her life when it came out in 1982. The song was long, but a shorter version became a huge hit, reaching number one in the UK and the US. Bonnie is happy that so many people still enjoy her song, and she received a special plaque from Spotify to celebrate one billion streams. She never gets tired of singing it, even if it doesn't make her rich.",
