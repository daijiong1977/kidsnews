  "summary": "A former prime minister of Malaysia named Najib Razak was sentenced to 15 years in prison and a huge fine for corruption. He was found guilty of taking money from a government fund called 1MDB. The court said he used his power wrongly and moved money into his own bank accounts. He will serve this sentence after finishing another prison term for a similar case. Najib says he did nothing wrong and that the money was a gift from another country, but the judge did not believe him. This case is part of a big scandal that affected many countries. The ruling shows that even powerful people must follow the law.",

    "This article is about a former leader in Malaysia who was punished for corruption. Corruption means using power to get money unfairly. The 1MDB fund was set up by the government to help the country, but a lot of money went missing. This scandal made people in Malaysia and other countries upset because it involved a lot of money. Courts are places where judges decide if someone broke the law. In this case, the judge said Najib Razak did wrong things and gave him a big punishment. This teaches us that everyone, even leaders, should be honest and follow the law."
