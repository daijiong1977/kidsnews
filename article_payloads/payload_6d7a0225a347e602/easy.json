  "title": "Clintons and a Big Decision About Testifying",
  "summary": "Bill and Hillary Clinton are trying to make a deal to talk to Congress about Jeffrey Epstein, a man who did bad things. Congress wants them to answer questions, but they haven't agreed yet. A leader in Congress, James Comer, is pushing for a vote that could punish the Clintons if they don't testify. The Clintons' spokesperson said they will show up, but Comer wants it in writing. This is happening quickly because Congress might vote soon. If they don't testify, they could face big fines or even go to jail. It's about following rules and telling the truth.",
