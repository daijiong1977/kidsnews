  "title": "Clintons Negotiate Testimony in Epstein Probe Amid Contempt Threat",
  "summary": "Former President Bill Clinton and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton are engaged in last-minute negotiations to comply with a congressional subpoena for testimony related to Jeffrey Epstein, a convicted sex offender. The House Oversight Committee, led by Republican Chair James Comer, is advancing criminal contempt of Congress charges against the Clintons for defying the subpoena. While a spokesperson for the Clintons indicated they would testify, Comer insists on having a written agreement and demands sworn depositions from both. The Clintons had offered alternative arrangements, such as a transcribed interview for Bill and a sworn declaration for Hillary, but Comer rejected these. The contempt resolution is moving through the House Rules Committee, threatening fines and incarceration if passed. This situation highlights tensions between congressional authority and individual compliance in high-profile investigations.",

    "Jeffrey Epstein was a financier convicted of sex trafficking minors, and his case has sparked numerous investigations into his associates and activities. Congress has the power to issue subpoenas as part of its oversight role, and contempt of Congress is a mechanism to enforce compliance, with penalties including fines up to $100,000 and up to one year in jail. Bill Clinton served as U.S. President from 1993 to 2001, and Hillary Clinton served as Secretary of State from 2009 to 2013; both have been linked to Epstein through past associations. The House Oversight Committee is a key body for conducting investigations, and this probe reflects ongoing political and legal battles over accountability and transparency in government."
