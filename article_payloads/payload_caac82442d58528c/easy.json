  "title": "Scammers Trick People to Steal Money Meant for Sick Kids",
  "summary": "This article tells a sad story about children with cancer who are tricked by bad people. Scammers make videos of these sick kids, like a boy named Khalil, to ask for money for their treatment. The videos show the kids looking very sick and crying, but sometimes the scenes are fake, like using onions to make tears. The scammers raise a lot of money from kind people who want to help, but the families often get little or none of it. For example, Khalil's family only got a small filming fee, and he died without the treatment money. The BBC found many families around the world who were scammed this way, with millions of dollars stolen. They identified a man named Erez Hadari as a key person in this scam. The article warns people to be careful when donating online to help sick children.",

    "This article is about a serious problem where scammers exploit families with sick children. Cancer is a disease that requires expensive treatments, and many families turn to crowdfunding for help. Crowdfunding is when people ask for money online from others. Unfortunately, some bad actors create fake campaigns to steal this money. The BBC, a trusted news source, investigated this issue and found that millions of dollars were raised but not given to the families. It's important to learn about online safety and how to verify charities before donating to help prevent such scams."
