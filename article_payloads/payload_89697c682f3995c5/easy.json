  "title": "Lizzo Wins Part of a Lawsuit About Body Shaming",
  "summary": "Pop star Lizzo is happy because a judge said she did not fat-shame her dancers. Some dancers sued her in 2023, saying she made fun of their weight. The judge dismissed that part, but the dancers still have other claims. They say Lizzo made them go to sex shows and touch people without clothes. Lizzo says she fired the dancers for recording her secretly, not for gaining weight. Her team calls the lawsuit a made-up story. The case will continue in court about the sex show claims. Lizzo is known for songs that celebrate all body types.",
