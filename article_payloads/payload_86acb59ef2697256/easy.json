  "title": "Supreme Court Case About President Trump and the Federal Reserve",
  "summary": "The Supreme Court is hearing a case about President Trump trying to fire a Federal Reserve governor named Lisa Cook. President Trump said she did something wrong, but she works for the government and was appointed by President Biden. Cook went to court to stop her firing, and lower courts said she could keep her job. Now, the Supreme Court is deciding if the firing was legal. The case is important because it could affect how independent the Federal Reserve is from the president. The Federal Reserve helps control money and interest rates in the United States. Some Supreme Court justices asked questions about why the case was rushed and if Cook had a fair chance to defend herself. This shows they are carefully thinking about the rules.",

    "The Federal Reserve is like a big bank for the United States that helps keep money stable. It has governors who are appointed by the president and approved by the Senate. Sometimes, presidents might want to fire these governors, but there are rules to protect their jobs so they can work independently without political pressure. This case is about whether President Trump followed those rules when he tried to fire Lisa Cook. Understanding this helps us learn about how government workers are protected and why independence in money matters is important for everyone."
