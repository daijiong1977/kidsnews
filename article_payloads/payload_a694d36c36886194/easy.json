  "title": "How Lasers Break Apart Tiny Football Molecules",
  "summary": "Scientists used special X-ray cameras to make movies of how strong lasers break apart a molecule called Buckminsterfullerene, which looks like a tiny soccer ball. This molecule is made of 60 carbon atoms. By shining intense laser light on it, they watched how the molecule changes and splits into pieces. This helps us learn how to control chemical reactions with light. The research was done by teams from Germany, Switzerland, the USA, and Japan using a big machine called the Linac Coherent Light Source. They found that at low laser power, the molecule expands first, and at high power, it breaks apart quickly. This work is important for understanding how atoms move in molecules.",

  "background_read": [
    "Scientists study molecules to understand how things work at a tiny level. Molecules are made of atoms, and when light hits them, they can change. In this case, researchers used powerful lasers and X-rays to see how a carbon molecule breaks apart. This helps in learning how to use light to start or stop chemical reactions, which could lead to new ways to make medicines or materials. The experiment was done with teams from different countries working together."
