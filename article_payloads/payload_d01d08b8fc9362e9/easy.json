  "title": "Lawmakers Work Together to Help People Keep Health Insurance",
  "summary": "In the United States, many people get help from the government to pay for health insurance under a law called the Affordable Care Act. This help is called subsidies. In just two weeks, these subsidies might end for millions of people, which could make health insurance too expensive for them. But there is some good news! A small group of Republicans in Congress, led by four members, decided to work with Democrats to try to save the subsidies. They signed a petition to force a vote in the House of Representatives to extend the subsidies for three more years. This means they want to keep the help going until 2027. However, the vote won't happen until January, so people have to wait. Meanwhile, Republicans are also working on another bill to lower health care costs, but it doesn't include extending the subsidies. Two lawmakers from California, Republican Kevin Kiley and Democrat Jimmy Panetta, are talking about this issue. Kiley says he wants to find a compromise that both parties can agree on, not just pass a bill that might not work. This shows that sometimes politicians from different parties can come together to solve big problems for people.",

    "The Affordable Care Act, often called Obamacare, is a law in the United States that helps people get health insurance. It was passed in 2010 to make sure more Americans can see doctors and stay healthy. Subsidies are like discounts or money from the government that lower the cost of insurance for people who don't have a lot of money. Congress is made up of two groups: the Senate and the House of Representatives. Lawmakers there make decisions about laws. Sometimes, Republicans and Democrats disagree, but in this case, some are working together to help people keep their health insurance. This is important because without subsidies, many families might not afford insurance and could get sick without care."
