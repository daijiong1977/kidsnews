  "title": "Scientists Fix Kidneys in Mice, Could Help People Too",
  "summary": "Scientists have found a way to fix damaged kidneys in mice, which might help people in the future. Kidneys are organs in our bodies that clean our blood. Sometimes, they get hurt and stop working well. The researchers discovered that certain fatty molecules called ceramides can harm the tiny parts inside kidney cells called mitochondria, which give energy to the cells. This damage can cause kidney injury. But by changing how these molecules work or using a new medicine, the scientists protected the mitochondria and stopped the kidneys from getting hurt in mice. This is exciting because if it works for humans, it could help many people with kidney problems. The study gives hope that new treatments could be developed to keep kidneys healthy.",

    "Kidneys are important organs that clean our blood by removing waste. When kidneys get injured, it can make people very sick. Scientists often use mice in research because their bodies are similar to humans in some ways. Mitochondria are like tiny batteries in cells that provide energy. Ceramides are fats that can build up and cause problems. This research shows how fixing these issues might lead to new medicines for kidney diseases in the future."
