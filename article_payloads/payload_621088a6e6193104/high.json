  "title": "Tsitsipas Contemplates Retirement Amidst Persistent Back Injury in 2025 Season",
  "summary": "Stefanos Tsitsipas, the Greek tennis professional who has achieved a career-high ranking of world number three and been a finalist in Grand Slam tournaments, disclosed that he seriously contemplated retirement during the 2025 season due to debilitating back pain. This injury, which persisted for six to eight months, culminated in a distressing episode following his US Open second-round defeat to Daniel Altmaier, where he was immobilized for two days. Currently positioned at 36th in the ATP rankings with minimal competitive play since August, Tsitsipas has undergone medical intervention and recently completed a five-week off-season training regimen without pain, signaling potential recovery. He articulated his apprehension about match completion and expressed optimism for his upcoming participation in the United Cup and Australian Open. Tsitsipas's narrative underscores the psychological and physical toll of athletic injuries, as he aims for a resurgence in 2026, prioritizing pain-free performance and a return to elite form through dedicated effort and sustained treatment.",
