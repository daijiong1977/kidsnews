  "title": "Dinosaur Footprints Found in Italy",
  "summary": "Thousands of dinosaur footprints have been discovered on a mountain in Italy. The footprints are very old, from 210 million years ago, and were found in a national park. They belong to prosauropods, which were big plant-eating dinosaurs with long necks. A photographer saw the footprints on a steep wall, and scientists think the area was once a flat, wet place where dinosaurs lived in herds. The footprints show the dinosaurs walked in rows and sometimes stopped to rest. This discovery helps us learn more about dinosaurs and our planet's history.",

    "Dinosaurs were ancient animals that lived millions of years ago, long before humans. They came in many shapes and sizes, some eating plants and others eating meat. Fossils like footprints help scientists understand how dinosaurs lived and moved. National parks are special places where nature is protected, allowing discoveries like this to happen. Learning about dinosaurs teaches us about Earth's past and how it has changed over time."
