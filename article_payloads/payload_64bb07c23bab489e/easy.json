  "title": "A New Eye Treatment Helps People See Better",
  "summary": "Doctors in London have found a new way to help people with a rare eye problem called hypotony. This problem makes the pressure in the eye too low, which can cause blindness. At Moorfields hospital, doctors used a special gel injection to treat patients. Nicki Guy was the first patient to try it. Before the treatment, she could only see blurry shapes and had to use a magnifying glass. Now, she can see much better and read letters on an eye chart. She says it changed her life because she can watch her child grow up. The gel is safe and clear, unlike old treatments that were toxic or blurry. This new method has helped seven out of eight patients in a study, giving hope to others with this eye condition.",

    "Hypotony is a rare eye condition where the pressure inside the eyeball drops too low, causing it to collapse and potentially lead to blindness. It can happen after eye injuries, surgeries, or due to certain medications. Traditional treatments like steroids or silicone oil have been used but can be harmful over time or cause blurry vision. The new treatment involves injecting a safe, transparent gel to restore eye pressure and improve vision, offering hope to patients who might otherwise lose their sight."
