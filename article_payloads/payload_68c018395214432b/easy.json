  "summary": "Aryna Sabalenka is a top tennis player who has won four big Grand Slam finals but also lost four. She is very strong and hits the ball hard, which helps her win many matches and stay number one in the world. However, in her latest final at the Australian Open, she was winning 3-0 in the last set but ended up losing to Elena Rybakina. Experts say she got nervous and made mistakes. Even though she has four Grand Slam titles, some people think she could do better because she has lost other finals and semi-finals too.
