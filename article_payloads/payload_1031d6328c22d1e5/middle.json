    "Stan Wawrinka is a Swiss professional tennis player known for his powerful one-handed backhand and success during the 'Big Three' era dominated by Novak Djokovic, Rafael Nadal, and Roger Federer. He turned pro in 2002 and rose to a career-high ranking of world number three. Wawrinka's major achievements include winning three Grand Slam titles: the 2014 Australian Open (defeating Nadal), the 2015 French Open (defeating Djokovic), and the 2016 US Open (defeating Djokovic). He also won 16 ATP tour titles and an Olympic gold medal in doubles at the 2008 Beijing Games with Federer. In recent years, injuries have affected his performance, dropping his ranking outside the top 150. His retirement announcement for 2026 reflects a common trend in sports where athletes plan their exits to maximize legacy and fan engagement, as seen in other tennis stars like Serena Williams."
