  "title": "Women Hurt by Breast Cancer Care in a Hospital",
  "summary": "This article tells us about women who had breast cancer and were treated badly at a hospital in England called County Durham and Darlington Foundation Trust. Over 200 cases are being looked into because some women had unnecessary surgeries, delays in finding out they had cancer, and did not get kind care. One woman, Kate, found a lump and had to wait a long time for her test results, which made her very scared and upset. The hospital has said sorry and admits they did not act on warnings for many years. This shows how important it is for hospitals to provide safe and caring treatment for everyone.",

    "Breast cancer is a disease where cells in the breast grow out of control. It can be treated with surgery, medicine, or other ways. Hospitals like the NHS in the UK help people get better. Sometimes, if care is not good, patients can be hurt. This article talks about a hospital that did not listen to warnings and caused harm to women with breast cancer. It reminds us that hospitals must always be careful and kind to patients."
