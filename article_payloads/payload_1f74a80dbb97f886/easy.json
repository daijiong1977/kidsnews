  "title": "Three Earth-Sized Planets Found Orbiting Two Suns",
  "summary": "Astronomers have made an amazing discovery of three planets that are about the same size as Earth. These planets are orbiting two stars in a system called TOI-2267. This is the first time scientists have seen planets passing in front of both stars, which is called transiting. The system is very compact and cold, which is surprising because it doesn't match what we usually think about how planets form. In the future, powerful telescopes like the James Webb Space Telescope will help us learn more about what these planets are made of, such as if they have water or air. This finding helps us understand more about planets outside our solar system and could lead to finding other worlds like Earth.",

    "Stars are big balls of gas that give off light and heat. Our sun is a star, and planets like Earth orbit it. Sometimes, planets orbit two stars, which is called a binary system. When a planet passes in front of a star, it blocks a little light, and scientists can detect this to learn about the planet. The TOI-2267 system has three Earth-sized planets doing this around two stars, which is a new discovery that helps us understand how planets form in different environments."
