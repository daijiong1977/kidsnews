  "title": "Exploring the UK Budget: Taxes, Wages, and Economic Plans",
  "summary": "Chancellor Rachel Reeves is set to deliver a Budget that includes tax increases and minimum wage hikes aimed at economic improvement. The minimum wage for over-21s will rise to £12.71 per hour in April 2026, with increases for younger age groups as well, and plans to eventually unify rates for all adults. Additionally, a new 'milkshake tax' will extend the sugar levy to milk-based drinks, potentially raising prices or encouraging reduced sugar content. Reeves emphasizes that these measures are fair and necessary to address NHS waiting lists, national debt, and cost of living, while fostering growth through investments. The Budget statement will occur in the House of Commons, followed by a response from opposition leader Kemi Badenoch. Despite avoiding income tax rate hikes, the government may extend freezes on thresholds, reflecting a balanced approach to revenue generation amid business concerns about wage impacts.",

  "Article_Structure": [
    "The article outlines main points including minimum wage hikes, tax extensions like the milkshake tax, and spending strategies to reduce debt and NHS waits. Its purpose is to inform the public about upcoming economic policies and justify them as fair for growth. Evidence comes from official announcements and sources, but lacks independent verification, raising questions on credibility. The author, BBC News, is reputable, but the piece relies on government statements, potentially showing bias. Methodology involves reporting pre-Budget leaks and statements, offering a timely yet preliminary view that requires critical evaluation for balanced understanding."
