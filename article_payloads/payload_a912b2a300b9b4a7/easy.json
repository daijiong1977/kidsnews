  "title": "What's in the New Budget?",
  "summary": "The government is planning a new budget with changes to taxes and wages. Chancellor Rachel Reeves wants to make the economy better by raising the minimum wage for workers. For example, adults over 21 will get £12.71 per hour in 2026. There's also a new tax on sugary milkshakes and milk drinks to make them healthier. The government hopes this will help reduce debt and improve the NHS. Reeves says these are fair choices to build a stronger Britain. The budget will be announced in the House of Commons, and the opposition leader will respond.",
