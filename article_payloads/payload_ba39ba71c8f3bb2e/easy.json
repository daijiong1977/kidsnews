  "title": "How Cleaner Air Made a Gas Problem Worse",
  "summary": "During the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, many people stayed home, so cars and factories stopped polluting as much. This made the air cleaner, which was good. But scientists noticed something surprising: a gas called methane, which can warm the Earth, increased a lot that year. Methane usually gets broken down in the air by a special chemical called the hydroxyl radical. This chemical needs pollution from cars and factories to be made. With less pollution during the lockdowns, there wasn't enough of this chemical to destroy methane, so more methane stayed in the air. Scientists found that this caused most of the methane increase. They also discovered that some extra methane came from wetlands in Africa and Asia, where microbes produce it when it rains a lot. This shows that cleaning the air can have unexpected effects on other environmental problems.",

    "Methane is a greenhouse gas that contributes to global warming. During the COVID-19 pandemic, lockdowns reduced human activities, leading to cleaner air but also unexpected environmental changes. Scientists study how different parts of the environment interact, like how air pollution affects methane levels. Wetlands are natural areas that can release methane when conditions are wet, showing how weather and human actions can impact the planet."
