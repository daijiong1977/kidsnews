  "title": "Old Plastic from Canada Washes Up on a Beach",
  "summary": "Plastic bottles and trash from Canada in the 1960s and 1970s have washed up on a beach in Orkney, Scotland. People who clean beaches are finding a lot of plastic, and they feel overwhelmed by how much there is. David Warner, who organizes beach clean-ups, has found hundreds of bottles this year, more than last year. The plastic comes from Newfoundland and Labrador in Canada. Strong winds and storms are bringing this old trash to the shore. The beach is a special place for birds, and the litter can be dangerous for wildlife. Experts say that old landfill sites near the coast are also releasing this plastic into the ocean.",

    "This article talks about old plastic trash from Canada washing up on a beach in Orkney, Scotland. Beach cleaners are finding a lot of plastic bottles from the 1960s and 1970s, and they feel overwhelmed because there is so much. Strong winds and storms are bringing this trash to the shore, and it can be dangerous for birds and other animals that live there. Experts say that old landfill sites near the coast are also releasing plastic into the ocean, which adds to the problem. This shows how plastic can travel far in the ocean and cause pollution for a long time."
