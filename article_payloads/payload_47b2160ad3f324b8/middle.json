  "title": "Raducanu Criticizes Australian Open Scheduling Challenges",
  "summary": "Emma Raducanu, the British tennis star, has raised concerns about the scheduling of her first-round match at the Australian Open. She arrived in Melbourne on Saturday after competing in a warm-up tournament in Hobart and facing flight delays, leaving her with less than 48 hours to prepare. Raducanu, seeded at a major for the first time in over three years, must face Thailand's Mananchaya Sawangkaew on Sunday night. She expressed difficulty with the short turnaround, noting that more practice time would be beneficial. Additionally, her match is scheduled second in the evening session on Margaret Court Arena, following a men's singles match that could last five sets. This means Raducanu might not start playing until close to midnight, a common issue at the Australian Open where matches often run late. She argues that scheduling women's matches after potential five-set men's matches is illogical and harmful to players' performance and health. Raducanu emphasizes making the most of the situation but highlights the need for better planning in tennis tournaments.",
