  "title": "Emma Raducanu's Tennis Match Schedule Problem",
  "summary": "Emma Raducanu is a tennis player who is playing in the Australian Open tournament. She arrived in Melbourne on Saturday and has to play her first match on Sunday night. This gives her less than two days to practice and get ready. She thinks it is hard to play so soon after traveling. Also, her match might start very late at night because it is after a men's match that could take a long time. Raducanu says this schedule does not make sense for her and other players. She wants more time to prepare and thinks late matches are not good for athletes.",
