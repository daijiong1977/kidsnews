  "title": "Turning Bad Air into Useful Stuff",
  "summary": "Scientists have made a cool new device that helps clean the air. It takes carbon dioxide, which is a gas that comes from things like home heaters and factories and can pollute the air, and turns it into something useful called formic acid. This device is like a special electrode with three layers that work together to catch the carbon dioxide and change it right away. Formic acid is used in fuel cells and other industrial jobs, so this could make recycling carbon easier and cheaper. The scientists tested it and found it works better than old methods, even when the air has other gases mixed in. This could help reduce pollution and make our air cleaner in the future.",

    "Carbon dioxide is a gas that we breathe out and comes from burning fuels like in cars or heaters. Too much of it can make the air dirty and cause problems like climate change. Scientists are always looking for ways to clean the air and use things we don't need, like carbon dioxide, to make useful stuff. This article talks about a new invention that catches carbon dioxide from the air and turns it into formic acid, which can be used in things like batteries and factories. It's like recycling trash into something new!"
