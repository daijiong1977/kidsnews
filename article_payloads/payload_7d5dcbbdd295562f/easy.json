  "title": "FBI Looks into Money Problems at Somali Daycares in Minnesota",
  "summary": "Federal agents are checking if Somali child care centers in Minnesota took money they shouldn't have. A person online said without proof that these daycares misused over $100 million. The FBI and Homeland Security are now investigating. State and city leaders doubt the claims because the Somali community is already dealing with immigration issues. A reporter explains that this started with a COVID program to give kids meals when schools closed, and it grew into a bigger problem. The agents are in Minneapolis to find out what happened.",

    "This article is about federal agents looking into possible fraud at Somali-run daycares in Minnesota. Fraud means taking money in a dishonest way. The Somali community in Minneapolis is a group of people from Somalia who live there. During COVID, schools closed, and a program was made to give kids meals, which might have led to money problems. Federal agents like the FBI help keep laws safe and investigate when something might be wrong. It's important to check facts before believing claims, especially when they affect communities."
