  "title": "Can Prince William Help the Royal Family?",
  "summary": "This article talks about the British Royal Family and how people feel about them. David Dimbleby, who has worked on TV for a long time, made a documentary to learn more. He found that fewer people think the monarchy is important now compared to the past, especially young people. The article says this is a problem because the Royal Family needs public support to survive. It mentions scandals with Prince Andrew and Harry and Meghan, but says the bigger issue is what the monarchy means today. Prince William is trying to act like a normal person to win back support. The article asks if this will work and what King Charles and William should do to make people like the monarchy more.",
