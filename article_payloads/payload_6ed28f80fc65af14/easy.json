The last episode was two hours long and was so exciting that many people tried to watch it at once, which caused Netflix's servers to have a problem for a short time. The show is set in a made-up town called Hawkins and has characters like Millie Bobby Brown. Fans watched the finale on Netflix or at special movie theaters in the US and Canada. The episode had big fights and sad moments that wrapped up the story for all the seasons. Some fans talked about mistakes in the show, like a jacket with a wrong logo. Many people had ideas about how the show would end, and some were right while others were wrong. The ending made viewers feel happy and sad as they said goodbye to the characters.",
