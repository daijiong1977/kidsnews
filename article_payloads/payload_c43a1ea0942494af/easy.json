  "title": "Donald Trump Sues the BBC Over a TV Show",
  "summary": "Donald Trump, a former US President, is suing the BBC, a big TV company, because he says they changed his speech in a documentary. The documentary was about Trump and aired before an election. In the show, they edited parts of his speech together to make it sound different. Trump is asking for a lot of money, $5 billion, in a court in Florida. The BBC said sorry for the edit but does not agree that they did anything wrong to deserve a lawsuit. They will fight the case in court. This happened after a newspaper found out about the edit from a secret memo, and two BBC bosses quit because of it. Trump's lawyers sent a letter asking for things like an apology and money, but the BBC only said sorry and won't pay.",

    "Donald Trump was the President of the United States from 2017 to 2021. The BBC is a well-known British broadcasting company that makes TV shows and news. A lawsuit is when people go to court to solve a disagreement. An edit in TV means cutting and putting parts together, which can change how something looks or sounds. This case is about whether changing a speech in a documentary is wrong and if it hurts someone's reputation."
