  "title": "Super Graphene Helps Store Energy Better",
  "summary": "Scientists have made an exciting discovery using a special material called graphene to improve how we store energy. They created a new type of supercapacitor, which is like a super-fast battery that can charge quickly and hold a lot of power. This breakthrough could help make electric cars charge faster, support power grids, and improve everyday electronics like phones. The researchers used a process called heat treatment to unlock more of the carbon's surface area, allowing ions to move quickly. This means the supercapacitors can store energy similar to old batteries but release it much faster. The material comes from natural graphite found in Australia, making it easy to produce. This innovation is a big step toward cleaner and more efficient energy storage for our future.",

    "Energy storage is how we save power from sources like sunlight or wind to use later. Batteries are common, but they charge slowly. Supercapacitors are a newer idea that can charge very fast, but they often don't hold as much energy. Graphene is a material made from carbon atoms arranged in a thin layer, and it's great for conducting electricity. Scientists are working to combine the best of both—fast charging and lots of storage—to help with things like electric vehicles and renewable energy. This article talks about a new discovery using graphene to make supercapacitors better, which could lead to cleaner and more efficient technology."
