  "title": "Jersey Says Yes to Helping Sick People End Their Lives",
  "summary": "Jersey, a small island near the UK, has made a new law. This law lets adults who are very sick and will die soon choose to end their own lives with help. People must have a terminal illness that causes a lot of pain and be expected to die within six months or one year for some diseases. This makes Jersey the second place in the British Isles to allow this, after the Isle of Man. Many politicians voted for it, and some voted against. People who support the law say it gives choice and dignity to those who are suffering. For example, a woman with cancer said she is scared of suffering and this law brings relief. The law needs final approval from the UK, and it could start next summer.",

    "Assisted dying is a topic where people debate whether very sick adults should be allowed to choose to end their lives with help. In some places, like Jersey and the Isle of Man, laws have been made to allow this to give people choice and reduce suffering. It involves rules like having a terminal illness and being expected to die soon. People argue about it because some think it is compassionate, while others worry about safety. This article talks about Jersey's new law and what it means for sick people there."
