  "title": "President Trump's New Tax on Imports After Court Ruling",
  "summary": "President Donald Trump has announced a new 10% tax on goods coming into the United States from other countries. This happened after the Supreme Court, the highest court in the U.S., said his old taxes were not allowed because he went beyond his power. The court's decision was a big win for businesses and states that did not like the taxes, and it might mean they get money back. Trump called the ruling terrible and said the judges were fools. He plans to use other laws to keep his taxes, which he thinks help U.S. investment and manufacturing. The taxes started last year on goods from many countries like Mexico, Canada, and China, and they made companies worried about higher prices. The court said Congress, which makes laws, did not give the president the power to make these taxes without clear rules.",

    "The United States has a president who makes decisions, but sometimes the Supreme Court checks if those decisions follow the rules. Taxes on imports, called tariffs, can affect how much things cost and where companies make products. When the court says a decision is wrong, it can change what happens in trade and business."
