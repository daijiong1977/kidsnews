  "title": "UK Builds More Wind Farms in the Sea",
  "summary": "The UK is building many new wind farms in the sea to make clean electricity. These projects are in England, Scotland, and Wales, including one that might become the world's biggest wind farm in the North Sea. The government says this will help lower energy bills and reduce pollution from fossil fuels. They want most of the UK's electricity to come from clean sources like wind and solar by 2030. However, some experts worry it might be hard to finish all these projects on time because building wind farms takes a long time. The UK currently has some wind farms, but they need to build more to reach their goal. This is important for fighting climate change and providing power to homes.",

    "The UK is working to make more electricity from clean sources like wind and solar to help the environment. Wind farms in the sea use wind to generate power without burning fossil fuels, which can cause climate change. The government has set goals to increase clean energy by 2030, but building these projects can be slow and challenging. This effort is part of a global push to use renewable energy and protect the planet for future generations."
