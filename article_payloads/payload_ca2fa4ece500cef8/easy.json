  "title": "Cleaning Light for Better Computers",
  "summary": "Scientists at the University of Iowa have found a new way to clean light particles called photons. Photons are tiny bits of light that are used in special computers called quantum computers and in secure communication systems. The problem is that sometimes, when scientists try to make single photons, extra unwanted photons are created. This is like having too many students in a line, making it messy and slow. The scientists discovered that the extra photons look similar to the laser light used to make them. By adjusting the laser light carefully, they can cancel out the extra photons, leaving only the clean, single ones. This could help make quantum computers faster and communication safer. The idea is still in theory, and they plan to test it in experiments soon.",

    "Light is made of tiny particles called photons. Scientists use lasers to make single photons for special computers called quantum computers, which can be faster than regular ones. Sometimes, extra photons are made by mistake, causing problems. This article talks about a new way to clean up these extra photons by using the laser light itself to cancel them out, which might help make better technology in the future."
