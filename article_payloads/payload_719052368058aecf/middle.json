  "title": "Trump's Plan to Raise Global Tariffs to 15% After Court Ruling",
  "summary": "President Donald Trump announced he will increase global tariffs to 15% after the Supreme Court struck down his previous import taxes. Initially, he proposed a 10% tariff on all goods entering the US, but he later raised it to 15% using Section 122 of the 1974 Trade Act, which allows temporary tariffs for about five months without immediate congressional approval. The Supreme Court's 6-3 decision ruled that Trump overstepped his authority by using the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) for last year's tariffs, which had collected over $130 billion. Trump criticized the court, calling the justices 'fools' and labeling their decision 'anti-American.' This move is part of his economic policy to boost domestic manufacturing and reduce the trade deficit, though the US trade deficit recently hit a record high. The new tariffs impact countries like the UK and Australia, who had negotiated a 10% deal. Reactions are mixed: a steel factory owner expressed disappointment, fearing job losses, while a soybean farmer welcomed the court's decision as a victory. The tariffs are set to potentially start on February 24, but it's unclear if the 15% rate will apply immediately.",

    "This article discusses President Trump's response to a Supreme Court ruling that invalidated his previous global tariffs. Trump is using a different legal basis, Section 122 of the 1974 Trade Act, to impose new tariffs at 15%, up from an initial 10%. The Supreme Court's decision was based on finding that Trump exceeded his authority under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act. Tariffs are a key part of Trump's economic strategy to promote US manufacturing and address the trade deficit, though the deficit has recently increased. The situation highlights tensions between executive power and judicial oversight, as well as the impact on international trade relations with countries like the UK and Australia. Understanding this requires knowledge of US government structure, trade laws, and economic concepts."
