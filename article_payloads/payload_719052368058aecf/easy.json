  "title": "President Trump Wants to Change Taxes on Goods from Other Countries",
  "summary": "President Donald Trump wants to put a new tax on goods coming into the United States from other countries. He first said it would be 10%, but then he changed it to 15%. This tax is called a tariff. The Supreme Court, which is like a group of judges, said no to his old tariffs because they thought he used too much power. Trump is upset about this and called the judges names. The new 15% tariff is allowed by a law from 1974 and can last for about five months. It might start soon, but we are not sure. This affects countries like the UK and Australia, who had a deal for 10%. Some people, like a factory owner, are sad because they think it will hurt jobs. Others, like a farmer, are happy because they think it will help them. Tariffs are part of Trump's plan to make more things in America and reduce how much the US buys from other countries.",

    "This article is about taxes on goods from other countries, called tariffs. President Trump wants to use tariffs to encourage businesses to make things in America instead of buying from other places. The Supreme Court stopped his old tariffs, so he is trying a new one with a different law. This affects people's jobs and how much things cost. It's important because it shows how leaders make decisions about money and trade with other countries."
