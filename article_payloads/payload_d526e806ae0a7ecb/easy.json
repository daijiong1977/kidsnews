  "title": "Light's Hidden Magnetic Power",
  "summary": "Scientists have discovered something amazing about light! Light is made of tiny waves that have both electric and magnetic parts. For a long time, people thought the magnetic part wasn't very important. But new research shows that this magnetic field is actually very strong and can make light twist and turn when it goes through certain materials. This discovery changes what we learned about the Faraday Effect, which was found almost 200 years ago. It helps us understand light better and could lead to new inventions like better cameras or medical tools. Learning about this can make science more fun and exciting for everyone!",

    "Light is all around us and helps us see. It travels in waves and has two main parts: electric and magnetic. Scientists have studied light for centuries, and one important discovery was the Faraday Effect by Michael Faraday in the 1840s. This effect showed that light can change direction in a magnetic field. Now, new research finds that the magnetic part of light is much stronger than thought, which could help create new gadgets like better lenses or sensors."
