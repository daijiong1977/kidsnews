  "title": "More Solar Farms Coming to the UK",
  "summary": "The UK government is building more solar farms to help make clean electricity. Solar farms use the sun's energy to create power without pollution. In a recent auction, the government gave contracts for 157 new solar projects across England, Scotland, and Wales. This will add a lot of solar power to the country. Some people are happy because solar energy is cheap and helps reduce the use of fossil fuels like coal and gas. But other people who live near the planned solar farms are worried. They think the farms might change the countryside too much. The government wants most of the UK's electricity to come from clean sources by 2030. Solar power works best in the summer when it's sunny, and it can help when wind power is low. Last year, solar provided over 6% of the UK's electricity, and sometimes even more in July. The government plans to have much more solar power by 2030.",

    "Solar farms are places with many solar panels that catch sunlight to make electricity. This is a clean way to power homes and businesses without harming the environment. The UK government is encouraging more solar farms to help meet goals for reducing pollution and using renewable energy. Some people support this because it fights climate change, but others are concerned about how it affects rural areas."
