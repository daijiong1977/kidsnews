  "title": "Amol Rajan Exits BBC Radio 4's Today to Pursue Entrepreneurship",
  "summary": "Amol Rajan, a prominent presenter on BBC Radio 4's Today programme, has announced his departure after nearly five years on the flagship news show. He plans to launch his own company, focusing on the digital 'creator economy,' which involves creating and monetizing online content. Rajan will continue some roles at the BBC, including hosting the quiz show University Challenge and his Radical podcast, but editorial rules likely prevent him from presenting news while running a business. His replacement on Today has not been announced. Rajan expressed mixed emotions, calling the decision 'mad' but exciting, and praised the Today team as world-class. He highlighted his ambition to become an entrepreneur, inspired by fictional character Del Boy, while maintaining ties to the BBC, which he regards as a noble institution. BBC editors commended his intellectual energy and humor, noting his significant contribution to the programme.",
