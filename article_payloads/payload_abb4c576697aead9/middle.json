  "title": "Disappointment Leads to Violence at Messi's India Tour Event",
  "summary": "During Lionel Messi's promotional tour in India, an event at Kolkata's Salt Lake Stadium turned chaotic when fans expressed their frustration violently. Thousands of supporters had purchased tickets costing up to 12,000 rupees, expecting to see the football legend in person, possibly in an exhibition game. However, Messi's appearance was brief—around 20 minutes—and he was largely obscured by a crowd of officials and celebrities as he walked around the pitch. After he was escorted away early by security, some fans became hostile, storming the pitch, vandalizing banners and tents, and hurling plastic chairs and water bottles. West Bengal's chief minister, Mamata Banerjee, expressed shock at the incidents. The tour, part of Messi's 'GOAT tour', includes stops in multiple Indian cities and featured the unveiling of a large statue in Kolkata. Fans voiced their anger, citing high ticket prices and poor visibility, with one noting they paid a month's salary for the experience. The event highlighted issues of event management and fan expectations in high-profile celebrity visits.",
