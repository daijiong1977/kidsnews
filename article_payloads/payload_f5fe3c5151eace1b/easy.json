  "title": "Train Ticket Prices Stay the Same Next Year",
  "summary": "The government in England has said that train ticket prices will not go up next year. This is the first time in 30 years that prices are frozen. It means that for tickets like season tickets and off-peak returns, the cost will stay the same until March 2027. Usually, train fares increase every year based on something called the retail price index, but this time they are being held steady. The government wants to help people with the cost of living by keeping travel affordable. A group that represents train companies thinks this is good news for customers. Not all tickets are included, though—only about 45% of fares in England are regulated. This freeze is a big change to make life easier for commuters and travelers.",
