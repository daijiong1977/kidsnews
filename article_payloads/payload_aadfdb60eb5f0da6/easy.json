  "title": "How Floods and Droughts Are Connected Around the World",
  "summary": "Scientists have found a big reason why floods and droughts happen in different places at the same time. They studied water all over Earth, including rivers, lakes, snow, and groundwater. They discovered that a climate pattern called ENSO, which includes El Niño and La Niña, is the main cause. ENSO can make some areas very wet and others very dry at once. This affects water for drinking and farming, and can change food trade. The scientists used satellites to measure water from space. They learned that when ENSO is active, it links faraway regions, causing these water extremes together. This helps us understand and prepare for floods and droughts better.",

    "Floods and droughts are big problems that can hurt people and nature. Scientists study them to learn why they happen. They look at water everywhere, not just rain. A climate pattern called ENSO, found in the Pacific Ocean, plays a key role. It can make weather change in many countries at once. By using satellites, scientists can see water changes from space. This helps predict when floods or droughts might occur, so we can be ready and protect our water and food."
