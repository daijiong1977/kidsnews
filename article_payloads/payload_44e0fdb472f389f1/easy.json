  "title": "Turning Paper Waste into Clean Energy",
  "summary": "Scientists have found a new way to make clean hydrogen energy using waste from paper mills. They created a special material from a plant waste called lignin, which is often thrown away or burned. This material helps speed up a reaction called oxygen evolution, which is important for splitting water into hydrogen and oxygen. Hydrogen is a clean fuel that doesn't pollute. The new catalyst, made with nickel and iron, works well and lasts a long time, making it cheaper than using expensive metals like platinum. This could help produce more hydrogen for clean energy in the future.",

    "Clean energy is important to protect our planet. Hydrogen is a type of clean fuel that can be made from water using electricity in a process called electrolysis. Scientists are looking for cheaper ways to make hydrogen to replace polluting fuels like coal and oil. Waste materials, like lignin from paper production, can be turned into useful things instead of being thrown away, helping the environment."
