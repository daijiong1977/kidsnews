  "title": "Unlocking the Secrets of High-Pressure Superconductors",
  "summary": "Scientists have made a breakthrough in understanding superconductors, materials that conduct electricity with zero resistance, which is crucial for applications like efficient power grids and quantum computing. Traditionally, superconductivity required extremely low temperatures, limiting practical use. However, recent discoveries of hydrogen-rich superconductors, such as hydrogen sulfide (H3S) and lanthanum decahydride (LaH10), operate at higher temperatures above liquid nitrogen's boiling point, classifying them as high-temperature superconductors. A key feature, the superconducting gap, indicates how electrons pair up to enable superconductivity, but measuring it in hydrogen-rich materials was challenging due to the need for immense pressures exceeding a million times atmospheric pressure. Researchers at the Max Planck Institute developed a new planar electron tunneling spectroscopy method to study these materials under extreme conditions. They successfully measured the superconducting gap in H3S, finding it to be about 60 millielectronvolts, and compared it to deuterium sulfide (D3S), which had a smaller gap. This difference confirmed that electron-phonon interactions drive superconductivity in these compounds, supporting theoretical models and advancing the quest for room-temperature superconductivity.",

    "Superconductors are advanced materials that conduct electricity with perfect efficiency, meaning no energy is lost as heat. This property has revolutionary potential for technologies like maglev trains, MRI machines, and quantum computers. Historically, superconductivity was only achievable at cryogenic temperatures near absolute zero, making it impractical for widespread use. In recent years, scientists discovered hydrogen-rich compounds, such as hydrogen sulfide and lanthanum decahydride, that become superconducting at higher temperatures, above -196°C (the boiling point of liquid nitrogen). These are termed high-temperature superconductors and represent a step toward room-temperature superconductivity. A critical aspect of superconductivity is the superconducting gap, which indicates how electrons form Cooper pairs to allow resistance-free flow. However, studying hydrogen-rich materials is challenging because they require pressures over a million times atmospheric pressure to exist, limiting the use of standard measurement techniques. Researchers at the Max Planck Institute innovated a tunneling spectroscopy method to overcome this, leading to new insights into the electron-phonon mechanism that underpins superconductivity in these compounds."
