  "title": "A Very Old Handprint in a Cave",
  "summary": "In Indonesia, on a small island near Sulawesi, there is a cave called Liang Metanduno. Inside this cave, on the wall, is a hand stencil that is 67,800 years old. This makes it the oldest art made by humans ever found. A hand stencil is made by putting a hand against a wall and blowing paint around it to leave an outline. Archaeologists, who study old things, found this hand stencil and used science to figure out how old it is. They also found other old art in caves nearby, like drawings of animals. This hand stencil shows that people lived in this area a long time ago and made art. It is a special link to the past, and scientists are still learning about it.",

    "This article is about a very old hand stencil found in a cave in Indonesia. It is 67,800 years old, making it the oldest art made by humans that we know about. Archaeologists, who are scientists that study old things, discovered it and used methods to date it. The hand stencil was made by someone placing their hand on a cave wall and blowing paint around it to create an outline. This shows that people lived in this area long ago and were creative. Other old art, like drawings of animals, has also been found nearby. Learning about this helps us understand how early humans explored and expressed themselves."
