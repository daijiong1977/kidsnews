  "title": "Discovering the World's Oldest Art: A 67,800-Year-Old Hand Stencil",
  "summary": "Archaeologists in Indonesia have identified a 67,800-year-old hand stencil in Liang Metanduno cave as the world's oldest known human-made artwork. This discovery, made by Adhi Agus Oktaviana and his team from Indonesia's National Research and Innovation Agency, surpasses the previous record-holder, a Neanderthal hand stencil in Spain, by about 1,100 years. The hand stencil was created by placing a hand against a limestone cave wall and blowing a mixture of pigment and water to form a negative outline. Using uranium-thorium dating on a calcite layer covering the faded stencil, researchers determined its age, revealing it as evidence of early human presence in Wallacea, the island region between Asia and Australia. The study involved surveying 44 rock art sites in Sulawesi and its satellite islands, uncovering 14 new sites and dating 11 artworks. This finding highlights a vibrant artistic culture during the late Pleistocene epoch in Sulawesi, with other ancient artworks like murals depicting animals and human-like figures also documented. The hand stencil serves as a tangible link to past human exploration and creativity, though its exact meaning remains unknown. Ongoing archaeological work suggests more discoveries may await in these understudied areas.",

    "This article discusses the discovery of a 67,800-year-old hand stencil in Liang Metanduno cave, Indonesia, recognized as the world's oldest human-made artwork. Archaeologists, led by Adhi Agus Oktaviana, conducted a six-year survey of rock art sites in Sulawesi and its satellite islands, using uranium-thorium dating on calcite layers to determine the age of artworks. The hand stencil, created by blowing pigment around a hand placed on a cave wall, represents early human presence in Wallacea, a key region for understanding human migration between Asia and Australia. This finding challenges previous records and highlights a longstanding artistic culture during the late Pleistocene. Other ancient artworks in the area, such as murals depicting animals, further enrich our knowledge of early human expression. The article emphasizes the importance of ongoing archaeological research in understudied regions to uncover more about our past."
