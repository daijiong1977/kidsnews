  "title": "Royal Valentine's Day Photo Marks Catherine's Recovery Journey",
  "summary": "Prince William and Princess Catherine released a previously unseen black-and-white photograph for Valentine's Day, taken by photographer Josh Shinner in Norfolk during April of the previous year. Shared on their social media channels with a caption and heart emoji, this marks their second annual public acknowledgment of the day, following a photo from 2025 that was extracted from a video announcing the end of Catherine's cancer treatment. The article also references a family Christmas card from 2025, featuring the couple and their three children amidst spring daffodils, also captured by Shinner in Norfolk. This imagery underscores Catherine's gradual reintegration into public life as she recovers from cancer and chemotherapy. Additionally, the piece briefly mentions Prince William's charitable donation to a mental health campaign and his official visits, including to sensitive regions like Saudi Arabia, though the focus remains on the personal and symbolic aspects of the royal family's public engagements.",
