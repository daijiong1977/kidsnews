  "title": "Unlocking Graphene's Quantum Potential with Light Control",
  "summary": "Graphene, a single-layer carbon material known for its strength and excellent electrical conductivity, has revealed new quantum capabilities through recent research. A study led by the University of Göttingen, in collaboration with institutions in Braunschweig, Bremen, and Fribourg, provides direct evidence of Floquet effects in graphene. Using femtosecond momentum microscopy, scientists illuminated graphene samples with rapid light pulses and observed changes in electron behavior over ultrashort timescales. This confirms that Floquet engineering—a method where light alters material properties—works in metallic and semi-metallic quantum materials like graphene. The findings, published in Nature Physics, demonstrate that this technique can precisely control electronic states, potentially enabling advancements in electronics, computers, and sensors. Researchers highlight the excitement around investigating topological properties, which could support the development of reliable quantum computers and innovative sensors. Supported by the German Research Foundation, this study opens new avenues for manipulating quantum materials with light, pushing the boundaries of future technology.",
