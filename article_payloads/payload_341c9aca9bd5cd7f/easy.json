  "title": "Graphene's Secret Power for Future Gadgets",
  "summary": "Graphene is a super thin material made of carbon atoms that is very strong and great at conducting electricity. Scientists have found something new about it called 'Floquet effects.' This happens when they shine fast light pulses on graphene, which changes how its electrons behave. This discovery could help make better electronics like faster computers and improved sensors in the future. The research was done by a team from the University of Göttingen and other universities, and it shows that light can control materials in special ways. This is exciting because it might lead to new technologies that use light to make gadgets work better and smarter.",
