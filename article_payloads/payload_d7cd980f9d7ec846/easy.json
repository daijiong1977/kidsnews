  "title": "Aston Martin Cuts Jobs to Save Money",
  "summary": "Aston Martin, a famous car company known for James Bond movies, is cutting 20% of its jobs. This means about 600 people will lose their jobs because the company lost a lot of money last year. The company said it needs to save money, and this will help save around £40 million each year. They also mentioned that problems with US tariffs and low demand in China made things harder. Aston Martin has its main office in the UK, and most of the job cuts will happen there. The company is also delaying some plans to spend money on electric cars to save more. This is a tough decision to help the company in the future.",
