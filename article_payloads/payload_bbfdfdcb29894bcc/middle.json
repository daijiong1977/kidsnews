  "title": "Djokovic Steps Down from Tennis Union Over Governance Issues",
  "summary": "Novak Djokovic, a top tennis player with 24 Grand Slam titles, has announced his complete departure from the Professional Tennis Players Association (PTPA), which he co-founded with Canadian player Vasek Pospisil in 2021. The PTPA was established as a breakaway union to provide tennis players with a stronger, independent voice in the sport. Djokovic cited ongoing concerns about transparency, governance, and the representation of his voice and image as reasons for his decision. He expressed pride in the original vision but stated that his values no longer align with the organization's current direction. Djokovic plans to concentrate on his tennis career, family, and contributions to the sport that reflect his principles. Meanwhile, the PTPA has faced challenges, including legal action against major tennis bodies like the ATP and WTA over alleged anti-competitive practices and player welfare issues. The PTPA claims it is the target of a defamation and intimidation campaign due to this litigation, with a federal court ruling against such harassment. The organization is working with legal counsel to address misinformation. This move highlights tensions within professional tennis regarding player representation and governance.",
