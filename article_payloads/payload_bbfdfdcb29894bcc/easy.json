He helped start a group called the Professional Tennis Players Association (PTPA) in 2021 with another player, Vasek Pospisil. This group was made to give tennis players a stronger voice. Now, Djokovic has decided to leave the PTPA completely. He says he is worried about how the group is run and how it uses his name and picture. Djokovic wants to focus on playing tennis and spending time with his family. The PTPA says it is being treated unfairly because it is taking legal action against other tennis organizations.
