  "title": "Emma Raducanu's Health Challenges Lead to Match Retirement in Qatar",
  "summary": "Emma Raducanu, the British number one tennis player, retired from her first-round match at the Qatar Open against Camila Osorio, just two days after losing the Transylvania Open final to Sorana Cirstea. In the Qatar match, Raducanu won the first set 6-2 but lost the second 6-4. During the deciding third set, she called for a trainer to have her blood pressure checked after being broken, and subsequently forfeited the match when trailing 2-0. This incident follows a pattern of health issues; in the Transylvania final, she also had her blood pressure taken and later revealed she was battling a chest infection. Since her historic 2021 US Open victory, Raducanu has been plagued by injuries and inconsistency on the WTA Tour, including previous retirements like at the Wuhan Open. Additionally, she has faced coaching instability, having split with her ninth coach since 2021 after the Australian Open. These factors highlight the physical and professional challenges impacting her career.",
