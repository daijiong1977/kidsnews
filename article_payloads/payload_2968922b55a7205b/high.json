  "title": "Causal Mechanisms of Altruism: Gamma Synchrony in Frontal-Parietal Networks Modulates Generosity",
  "summary": "A groundbreaking study in PLOS Biology elucidates the causal role of brain synchrony in promoting altruistic behavior. Conducted by Jie Hu of East China Normal University and collaborators from the University of Zurich, the research employed transcranial alternating current stimulation on 44 participants during a Dictator Game involving 540 monetary decisions. By targeting the frontal and parietal lobes, the team induced gamma or alpha oscillations to examine effects on generosity. Results indicated that enhancing gamma synchrony between these regions led to a modest but significant increase in altruistic choices, with participants allocating larger sums to others even when it reduced personal earnings. A computational model revealed that stimulation altered decision-making processes by augmenting the valuation of others' outcomes. Although the study did not directly measure neural activity, limiting causal inferences, it provides compelling evidence that synchronized firing in specific brain networks underpins prosocial behavior. Coauthors Christian Ruff, Jie Hu, and Marius Moisa emphasized the demonstration of cause and effect, advancing theoretical frameworks on social cognition. This work has implications for understanding individual differences in selflessness and potential applications in fostering cooperation, with future research suggested to integrate electroencephalography for direct neural correlation.",

    "This study situates itself within the broader field of social neuroscience, which seeks to unravel the neural underpinnings of prosocial behaviors like altruism. Historically, research has correlated brain activity with generosity using neuroimaging, but establishing causality has been challenging. The use of transcranial alternating current stimulation represents an advancement, allowing for noninvasive manipulation of neural oscillations to observe behavioral outcomes. The Dictator Game is a well-established economic paradigm for measuring altruism, providing a controlled setting to assess decision-making. By focusing on gamma synchrony in the frontal-parietal network, the research connects specific oscillatory patterns to enhanced social cognition, drawing on theories of neural integration and executive function. The collaboration between East China Normal University and the University of Zurich underscores global efforts in cognitive science, with implications for understanding disorders characterized by social deficits and developing interventions to promote cooperation in diverse settings."
