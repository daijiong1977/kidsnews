  "title": "Brain Zaps Make People Share More",
  "summary": "Scientists did a fun experiment to see if they could make people nicer by using a special brain machine. They asked 44 people to play a money-sharing game called the Dictator Game. In this game, each person had to decide how much money to give to someone else. The scientists used a safe brain stimulation tool on the players' heads to make two brain parts work together better. They found that when the brain parts were synchronized in a gamma rhythm, people became more generous. They shared more money, even if it meant they got less for themselves. This shows that our brains can be trained to help others more. The study was led by Jie Hu and others from universities in China and Switzerland. It helps us understand how our brains make us kind and why some people are more selfless than others.",

    "Scientists wanted to learn why some people are kind and share, while others are not. They know that our brains control how we act. By using a safe machine to stimulate the brain, they tested if they could change behavior. This helps us understand how to be better friends and community members. The study was done by researchers from China and Switzerland, and it was published in a science journal. It shows that technology can help make the world a nicer place by encouraging generosity."
