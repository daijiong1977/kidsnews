  "title": "US Lawmakers Consider Legal Action Over Incomplete Epstein File Release",
  "summary": "Republican congressman Thomas Massie and Democratic congressman Ro Khanna are threatening legal action against US Attorney General Pam Bondi for not fully releasing the Department of Justice files related to Jeffrey Epstein, a convicted sex offender. A law signed by President Donald Trump required all documents to be released by a deadline, but only a portion was made public, with redactions and withheld information. This has angered Massie, Khanna, survivors of Epstein's abuse, and their allies. The lawmakers are discussing using 'inherent contempt,' a rare legal procedure that allows Congress to fine Bondi daily until compliance, which only requires House support unlike impeachment. Massie accused the DoJ of flouting the law's spirit, while Bondi's deputy defended their actions, claiming transparency and ongoing releases. The DoJ insists it is meeting legal obligations and plans more disclosures in coming weeks, highlighting a bipartisan effort to pressure for full transparency in this high-profile case.",

    "Jeffrey Epstein was a financier convicted of sex trafficking minors, whose case sparked widespread investigations. The 'Epstein files' refer to documents from US Department of Justice probes into his activities. In November, President Trump signed a law mandating full disclosure of these files to promote accountability. Attorney General Pam Bondi oversees this release, but partial disclosure with redactions has led to bipartisan criticism. Inherent contempt is an old congressional tool allowing fines for non-compliance, rarely used since the early 1900s. This situation highlights tensions between government transparency and legal processes, with survivors and lawmakers pushing for complete information to aid justice."
