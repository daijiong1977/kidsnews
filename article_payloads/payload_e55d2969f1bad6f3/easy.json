  "title": "Lawmakers Want More Epstein Papers Released",
  "summary": "Two US lawmakers, Thomas Massie and Ro Khanna, are upset because not all the government files about Jeffrey Epstein have been made public. Epstein was a man who hurt many people, and the law says all the papers should be released by a certain date. Only some papers came out, with parts hidden or missing, which makes the lawmakers and survivors angry. They are thinking about using a special rule called 'inherent contempt' to take legal action against Attorney General Pam Bondi, who is in charge of the papers. This rule could fine Bondi every day she doesn't release the full files. The Department of Justice says they are following the law and will release more soon, but the lawmakers want everything now to help the victims.",
