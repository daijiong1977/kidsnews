  "summary": "Jack Pinnington Jones is a tennis player from Great Britain. He is 22 years old and had a great week at the Dallas Open tournament. Jack had to play extra matches to get into the main part of the tournament. Then he beat two other players, including one from Italy and one from America, to reach the quarter-finals. This is his first time getting this far in a big ATP Tour event. Jack is now ranked 138th in the world, which is much better than before. Next, he will play against Marin Cilic, who won the US Open before. Jack decided to play tennis full-time instead of going back to college. He is very happy with his dream run in Dallas.",
