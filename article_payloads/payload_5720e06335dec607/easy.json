  "title": "Beaches in Danger: How Climate Change Affects Our Shores",
  "summary": "Scientists are warning that many beaches around the world might disappear because of climate change and too many buildings near the coast. Omar Defeo, a marine scientist from Uruguay, says that almost half of the beaches could be gone by the end of the century. Beaches are made up of three parts: the dune, the beach face, and the submerged area. They work together like a team to protect the shore from storms and provide homes for animals. When people build on dunes or have lots of visitors, it hurts the plants and animals living there. This can also make it harder for people who rely on beaches for fishing and tourism. Scientists are studying beaches in places like Brazil and Uruguay to find ways to protect them. It's important for countries to work together to save these beautiful places.",

    "Beaches are sandy shores by the ocean that many people enjoy for playing, swimming, and seeing wildlife. They are home to animals like crabs, birds, and fish. Climate change is causing the sea level to rise, which means water covers more of the beach. Also, when people build houses or roads too close to the beach, it can damage the sand and plants. Scientists study beaches to understand how to protect them. In places like Uruguay and Brazil, experts are working together to find solutions so that beaches can stay healthy for future generations."
