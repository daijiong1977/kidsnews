  "title": "NIST's New Policies Threaten Foreign Scientist Participation",
  "summary": "The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), a key US government research lab, is implementing new security measures that could significantly restrict foreign scientists' access and work opportunities. These changes include limiting after-hours lab access for noncitizens, capping international graduate students and postdoctoral researchers to three-year terms instead of the typical five to seven years needed for their projects, and canceling plans to hire foreign workers through programs like the Professional Research and Experience Program due to uncertainty over new security protocols. Lawmakers, such as Democrat Zoe Lofgren, have expressed concern that these measures exceed reasonable security needs and could drive away valuable expertise, damaging NIST's credibility and US scientific advancement. NIST spokesperson Jennifer Huergo states the changes aim to protect US science from theft and abuse, reflecting bipartisan priorities to safeguard intellectual property. However, critics argue this adds to broader Trump administration policies, like hiking H-1B visa fees and limiting post-graduation training, that may push immigrant researchers to other countries, hindering economic growth. The debate centers on balancing national security with maintaining a diverse, talented scientific workforce.",

    "NIST is a federal agency under the US Department of Commerce that develops and promotes measurement standards, advancing technology in areas like cybersecurity, manufacturing, and AI. It employs thousands, including many foreign scientists who contribute specialized skills. In recent years, concerns about intellectual property theft, especially from countries like China, have led to increased security scrutiny at national labs. The Trump administration has implemented various immigration and visa policies aimed at protecting US interests, but critics argue these may deter global talent. This article explores the tension between safeguarding research and maintaining an open, collaborative scientific environment essential for innovation."
