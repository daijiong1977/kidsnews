  "title": "A Science Lab Changes Rules for Foreign Scientists",
  "summary": "A big science lab in the US called NIST is making new rules that might make it harder for scientists from other countries to work there. These scientists help with important work like making computers safe and studying air quality. Some people in the government are worried because they think these changes could push away talented scientists who come from around the world. The lab says the rules are to protect US science from theft, but others say they go too far. This could mean the US loses smart people who want to do research here, and it might hurt trust in the lab. The story talks about how rules about visas and access to labs are changing, and some leaders want more information before the new rules start.",

    "NIST is a government lab in the US that does science research on things like cybersecurity and technology. Scientists from around the world come to work there because they are experts. Sometimes, rules change to protect secrets, but if they are too strict, it can make it hard for foreign scientists to help. This story is about balancing safety with keeping talented people in the US."
