  "title": "Moon Rocks Show Short Bursts of Strong Magnetism",
  "summary": "Scientists have solved a big mystery about the Moon's magnetic field. For years, people argued whether the Moon had a strong or weak magnetic field long ago. By studying rocks brought back by Apollo astronauts, researchers found that the Moon did have very strong magnetism, but only for short times. Most of the time, the Moon's magnetic field was weak. The Apollo missions collected rocks from one area that had these rare strong events, making it seem like they lasted longer than they did. The rocks with high titanium showed strong magnetism, while others did not. This helps us understand the Moon's history better.",

    "The Moon is Earth's closest neighbor in space. Scientists study it to learn about how planets form. Magnetism is a force that some objects have, like Earth, which has a magnetic field that protects us. The Apollo missions were space flights in the 1960s and 1970s that landed astronauts on the Moon and brought back rocks. These rocks help scientists understand the Moon's history, including its magnetic field, which is like an invisible shield. This article talks about new discoveries from those rocks."
