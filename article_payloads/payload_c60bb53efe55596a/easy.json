  "title": "A British Politician in Trouble in Bangladesh",
  "summary": "Tulip Siddiq, a Labour MP from the UK, has been given a two-year jail sentence in Bangladesh for a crime she says she didn't do. She was accused of using her influence to get land for her family from her aunt, who was the Prime Minister of Bangladesh. The trial happened without her being there, and she calls it unfair and silly. She lives in London and probably won't go to jail, but she has to pay a fine. This case is part of bigger political fights in Bangladesh after a change in government. Siddiq is focused on her job helping people in her area in the UK and denies all the charges.",
