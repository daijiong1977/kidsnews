  "title": "TikTok Makes a Deal to Stay in America",
  "summary": "TikTok, a popular app for sharing short videos, has made a big deal to avoid being banned in the United States. The app was in danger because some people in the government were worried about safety. Now, TikTok is creating a new American version with help from big companies like Oracle. This new version will have special rules to keep user data safe and protect national security. Adam Presser, who used to work at TikTok, will be the boss of this new project. The deal ends years of uncertainty and means TikTok can keep running in the U.S. without shutting down. This is important because many people, especially kids and teens, enjoy using TikTok to watch and make fun videos.",

    "TikTok is a social media app where users create and watch short videos. It started in China and became very popular worldwide, especially among young people. In the United States, some government leaders were concerned that TikTok might not keep user information safe because of its Chinese ownership. This led to talks about banning the app. To solve this, TikTok worked with American companies to make a new version that follows U.S. safety rules, so people can continue using it without worries."
