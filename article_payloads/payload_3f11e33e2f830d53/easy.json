    "A data breach happens when a company's computer system is broken into, and private information like names, addresses, or phone numbers is stolen. Scammers use this stolen data to trick people and steal money. For example, in a SIM swap attack, they pretend to be you to get a new phone SIM card, which lets them access your accounts. It's important to use strong passwords and be careful about sharing personal details online to stay safe."
