  "title": "Understanding SIM Swap Scams Through a Real-Life Case",
  "summary": "This BBC News article details how Sue fell victim to a SIM swap attack after her personal data was exposed in multiple data breaches. Scammers tricked her mobile network operator into issuing a new SIM card, allowing them to take control of her phone number. They then intercepted security codes to access her Gmail account, which led to them locking her out of bank accounts and opening a credit card in her name, resulting in over £3,000 in fraudulent purchases. Additionally, the attackers hacked her WhatsApp and sent threatening messages to her social groups. The investigation used tools like haveibeenpwned.com and Constella Intelligence to trace Sue's leaked information to breaches at PaddyPower in 2010 and Verifications.io in 2019. Cybersecurity expert Hannah Baumgaertner explains that such attacks rely on previously stolen personal data to bypass security measures. The article highlights the growing risk of data breaches and emphasizes the importance of vigilance and improved security practices to prevent similar incidents.",

    "Data breaches occur when cybercriminals access and steal personal information from organizations, often due to weak security. Common targets include emails, phone numbers, and addresses, which can be sold on dark web markets. SIM swap attacks exploit this by using stolen data to impersonate victims and gain control of their mobile numbers, enabling access to accounts protected by two-factor authentication. This case shows how historical breaches, like those at PaddyPower and Verifications.io, have long-term effects, highlighting the need for individuals to monitor their digital footprints and use security tools to detect exposures."
