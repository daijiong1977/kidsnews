  "title": "Tennis Friends Play Against Each Other",
  "summary": "In tennis, sometimes friends have to play against each other in big tournaments. Jessica Pegula and Lorenzo Musetti are tennis players who faced their doubles partners in matches at the Australian Open. Pegula played against McCartney Kessler, and Musetti played against Lorenzo Sonego. They said it was hard because they like their friends and want them to do well, but they still had to try to win. Pegula won her match easily, and Musetti won his match too. They felt bad about beating their friends, but in sports, players must compete even when it's tough. This shows that tennis can be challenging when you have to play against people you care about.",

    "Tennis is a popular sport played all over the world. In tournaments like the Australian Open, players compete in singles (one against one) and doubles (two against two). Sometimes, players who are friends or partners in doubles have to face each other in singles matches. This can be difficult because they care about each other but still want to win. It shows that sports require focus and effort, even when emotions are involved."
