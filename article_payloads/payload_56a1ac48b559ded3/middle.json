  "title": "A Record-Breaking Gravitational Wave Tests Einstein's Theory of Gravity",
  "summary": "Scientists have detected GW250114, the clearest gravitational wave signal ever recorded from merging black holes. This event provides a precise tool for testing Albert Einstein's theory of general relativity. The signal was observed by the LIGO, Virgo, and KAGRA collaborations on January 14, 2025, and announced in September 2025. Improved detector accuracy over the past decade made this signal much clearer than earlier ones like GW150914. According to physicist Keefe Mitman and colleagues, GW250114 behaves exactly as predicted by general relativity. When black holes merge, the resulting object vibrates like a struck bell, producing tones with oscillation frequencies and damping times. Measuring these tones allows scientists to calculate the mass and spin of the black hole and verify general relativity. In this case, two tones were measured, and they matched Einstein's theory. However, scientists suspect future signals might deviate, offering clues to unresolved mysteries like dark energy, dark matter, and quantum gravity. The study, published in Physical Review Letters, aims to explore potential cracks in Einstein's theory and advance our understanding of fundamental physics.",

    "Gravitational waves are ripples in space-time predicted by Einstein's general relativity, first directly detected in 2015. They are produced by cataclysmic events such as black hole or neutron star mergers. LIGO, Virgo, and KAGRA are ground-based interferometers that detect these waves by measuring tiny changes in distance. General relativity explains gravity well on large scales but conflicts with quantum mechanics on small scales, leading to unsolved problems like dark energy and dark matter. Black hole mergers provide a natural laboratory to test gravity theories, as their vibrations reveal properties like mass and spin. This research aims to push the boundaries of physics by seeking deviations that might indicate new laws of nature."
