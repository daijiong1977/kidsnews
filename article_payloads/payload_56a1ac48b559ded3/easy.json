  "title": "A Super Clear Space Ripple Helps Test Einstein's Idea",
  "summary": "Scientists have found a very clear space ripple called GW250114. This ripple was made when two black holes crashed together. It helps test Albert Einstein's theory of gravity, called general relativity. The ripple was detected by special machines called LIGO, Virgo, and KAGRA. These machines are much better now than 10 years ago, so they can see the ripple more clearly. The ripple acts just like Einstein's theory says it should. Scientists hope to find ripples that don't match the theory one day, which could teach us new things about gravity and the universe. Black holes vibrate like bells when they merge, and measuring these vibrations helps scientists check if Einstein was right.",

    "Gravity is a force that pulls things together, like why we stay on Earth. Albert Einstein had a big idea called general relativity to explain how gravity works in space. Black holes are mysterious objects with super strong gravity. When they crash, they make ripples in space called gravitational waves. Scientists use special machines to catch these ripples and learn more about the universe."
