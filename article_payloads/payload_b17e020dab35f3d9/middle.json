  "title": "Highlights and Mishaps at the 68th Grammy Awards",
  "summary": "The 68th Grammy Awards ceremony in Los Angeles featured a mix of awards, speeches, and performances, with notable highlights and some chaotic moments. Bad Bunny won three awards, while KPop Demon Hunters made history and Olivia Dean emerged as a rising star. Cher made a surprise appearance after 18 years to receive a lifetime achievement award and present record of the year, but her segment was messy; she gave a heartfelt speech but confused the audience by announcing Luther Vandross as the winner, later clarified as a track by Kendrick Lamar and SZA sampling Vandross. Host Trevor Noah joked about a national drinking game inspired by news events, adding humor to the show. The opening performance by Bruno Mars and Rosé, though award-nominated, did not win. Overall, the event showcased music's biggest night with both celebratory and perplexing elements.",
