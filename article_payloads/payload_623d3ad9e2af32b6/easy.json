  "title": "Beyoncé Becomes a Billionaire",
  "summary": "Beyoncé is now a billionaire, which means she has a lot of money—over one billion dollars! Forbes, a magazine that tracks rich people, says she is the fifth musician to become this rich. Other musicians like Taylor Swift and Rihanna are also billionaires. Beyoncé earned money from her big tour called the Renaissance World Tour, which made nearly $600 million. She also made a film of her concert and sold it in theaters, getting almost half of the $44 million it made. Her new album Cowboy Carter won a Grammy Award, and its tour made over $400 million from tickets and $50 million from merchandise. Even though some tickets sold slowly, the most expensive one cost £950 in the UK. Beyoncé also earned money from a Netflix show and commercials. This shows how successful she is as a singer and businesswoman.",
