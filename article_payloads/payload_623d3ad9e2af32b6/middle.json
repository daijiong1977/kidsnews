  "title": "Beyoncé's Billionaire Status and Music Empire",
  "summary": "Forbes has officially declared Beyoncé a billionaire, placing her as the fifth musician to achieve this financial milestone. This recognition follows years of substantial earnings from various ventures, including her highly successful Renaissance World Tour, which grossed nearly $600 million, and the Cowboy Carter tour, which added over $400 million in ticket sales and $50 million in merchandise. Beyoncé's strategic business moves, such as distributing her concert film directly through AMC theaters—earning her nearly half of the $44 million global box office—and securing lucrative deals like a Netflix halftime show and Levi's commercials, have significantly boosted her wealth. Her album Cowboy Carter, which won a Grammy Award for album of the year, further cemented her cultural impact. Despite challenges like slow ticket sales for some shows, with promoters reducing prices, the tour set record prices in the UK, with top tickets at £950. Forbes' assessment contrasts with other estimates, such as Bloomberg's inclusion of Selena Gomez as a billionaire, which Forbes disputes. This article underscores Beyoncé's evolution from a pop icon to a savvy entrepreneur, leveraging her music and brand to build a billion-dollar empire.",
