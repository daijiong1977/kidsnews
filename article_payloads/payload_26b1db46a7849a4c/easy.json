  "title": "NASA's Big Moon Trip",
  "summary": "NASA is planning a special mission called Artemis II to send four astronauts around the Moon in early March. This will be the first time people go that far into space in over 50 years. The astronauts will travel for 10 days, going around the far side of the Moon and back to Earth. They recently did a successful test called a 'wet dress rehearsal' where they filled the rocket with fuel and practiced the countdown. The crew includes three Americans and one Canadian, and they will live in a small spacecraft called Orion during the trip. This mission helps prepare for future Moon landings.",

    "NASA is a space agency that sends rockets and astronauts into space. The Moon is Earth's natural satellite, and people first landed on it in 1969. The Artemis program is NASA's new plan to explore the Moon again, with Artemis II being a step to send astronauts around it without landing. Astronauts train for years to go on space missions, and they use special equipment like rockets and spacecraft to travel safely."
