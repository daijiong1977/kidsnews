  "title": "NASA's Artemis II Mission: Returning Humans to Lunar Orbit",
  "summary": "NASA has announced a target launch date of early March for the Artemis II mission, marking the first crewed journey around the Moon in over five decades. This 10-day mission will involve four astronauts—three Americans and one Canadian—traveling aboard the Orion capsule, which is mounted on the Space Launch System (SLS) rocket. The mission follows a successful wet dress rehearsal, a critical pre-launch test where the SLS was fueled and the countdown sequence was practiced at the Kennedy Space Center in Florida. Issues from a previous test, such as hydrogen leaks, have been resolved. Artemis II aims to orbit the far side of the Moon, serving as a precursor to future lunar landings under the Artemis program. NASA officials express growing excitement, highlighting this as a key step in human space exploration beyond Earth orbit.",

    "NASA's Artemis program is a series of missions aimed at returning humans to the Moon and eventually sending them to Mars. The program builds on the legacy of the Apollo missions, which last landed astronauts on the Moon in 1972. Artemis II is the first crewed mission of this program, testing systems and procedures for deeper space travel. The Space Launch System (SLS) and Orion capsule are key components, developed over years to handle the challenges of lunar missions. Understanding space exploration involves knowledge of rocket science, astronaut training, and international collaboration, as seen with the inclusion of a Canadian astronaut."
