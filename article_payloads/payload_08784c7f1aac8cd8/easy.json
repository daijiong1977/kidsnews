    "This article is about famous musicians like Dua Lipa and Coldplay who are trying to help their fans. Ticket touts are a problem because they buy tickets and sell them for much more money, making it hard for regular fans to go to concerts. The singers wrote a letter to the government, which is the group that makes laws, asking them to do something about it. They want to cap resale prices, which means putting a maximum price on how much tickets can be resold for. This is part of a bigger effort to make sure everyone has a fair chance to enjoy live music without being overcharged. Understanding this helps us see how people can work together to solve problems in society."
