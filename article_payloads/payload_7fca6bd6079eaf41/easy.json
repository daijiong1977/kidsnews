  "title": "AI Helps Find What Makes Cancer Survival Better Around the World",
  "summary": "Scientists used a smart computer program called AI to study cancer survival in many countries. They looked at data from 185 countries to see what helps people survive cancer. They found that things like having enough money for healthcare, access to radiotherapy machines, and universal health coverage are important. The team made an online tool so people can pick a country and see what factors matter most there. This helps countries know what to improve to save more lives from cancer. The research was published in a cancer journal and led by doctors and researchers in the USA. They hope this work will guide countries to make better plans for cancer care.",

    "Cancer is a disease where cells grow out of control and can harm the body. People all over the world get cancer, but in some places, more people survive it than in others. Scientists want to understand why this happens so they can help everyone have a better chance. They use data, which is information collected from many sources, to study things like healthcare systems and treatments. This article talks about how AI, a type of computer technology, is used to analyze this data and find out what factors, like money and access to treatments, make a difference in cancer survival. It's important because it helps countries know what to focus on to improve health and save lives."
