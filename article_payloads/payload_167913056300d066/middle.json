  "title": "Financial Ties and Trust: Prince Andrew and David Rowland",
  "summary": "This article examines newly released emails from the Epstein files that shed light on the relationship between Prince Andrew and businessman David Rowland. The emails reveal that Prince Andrew referred to Rowland as his 'trusted money man' in communications with Jeffrey Epstein, indicating a close financial advisory role. As the UK's trade envoy at the time, Prince Andrew appears to have promoted Rowland's financial ventures to Epstein, but Epstein was hesitant due to UK media labeling Rowland a 'shady financier.' The emails also suggest that Rowland's private bank, Banque Havilland, which has since had its banking licence withdrawn by regulators in 2024, may have lent money to Prince Andrew's ex-wife, Sarah Ferguson, for expenses like a first-class flight to Nepal. While there have been previous claims about financial links between Prince Andrew and Rowland's bank, the BBC did not find direct evidence of payments to Andrew in the latest files. Jonathan Rowland, David's son, denied providing money in exchange for access but did not rule out loans or payments. The article highlights ongoing questions about Prince Andrew's finances and his associations with controversial figures, emphasizing the scrutiny from regulators and the media.",
