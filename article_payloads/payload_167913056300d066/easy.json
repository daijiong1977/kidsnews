  "title": "A Royal Friend and a Money Man",
  "summary": "This article talks about emails that show Prince Andrew, a member of the British royal family, had a close friend named David Rowland who helped him with money. Prince Andrew called Rowland his 'trusted money man' in messages to Jeffrey Epstein, a businessman who got into trouble. The emails suggest Prince Andrew tried to get Epstein to invest in Rowland's business projects. Rowland was a rich donor to a political party, but some people in the UK called him a 'shady financier,' which means they thought he might not be honest. Epstein did not want to work with Rowland after hearing this. The emails also mention that Rowland might have lent money to Prince Andrew's ex-wife, Sarah Ferguson, for things like a first-class flight to Nepal. Regulators have taken away the banking license from Rowland's bank, Banque Havilland, because of problems. The article says there are many questions about Prince Andrew's money and his friendship with Rowland, but not all claims are proven.",
