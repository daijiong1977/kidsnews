    "The 'Battle of the Sexes' was a famous tennis match in 1973 between Billie Jean King, a woman, and Bobby Riggs, a man. At that time, many people did not think women were as good as men in sports. Billie Jean King won the match, which helped show that women can be strong athletes too. This match was not just about tennis; it was about making society fairer for women. Today, women's tennis has more players and fans, but there are still challenges. Billie Jean King is a hero who fought for equality in sports."
