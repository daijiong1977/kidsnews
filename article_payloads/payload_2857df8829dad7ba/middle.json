    "The 1973 'Battle of the Sexes' was a landmark tennis match between Billie Jean King and Bobby Riggs, held during a time of significant gender inequality in sports. Riggs, a former champion, had boasted that women were inferior players, leading to a highly publicized contest that King won in straight sets. This victory symbolized a breakthrough for women's rights, challenging pervasive stereotypes and inspiring greater support for women's athletics. King co-founded the Women's Tennis Association and has been a lifelong activist for equality. In contrast, modern matches like Sabalenka vs. Kyrgios occur in a more equitable landscape, though debates about gender in sports persist. Understanding this history helps appreciate King's perspective on the evolving role of sports in societal change."
