  "title": "Unhealthy Foods Are Causing Big Health Problems Worldwide",
  "summary": "Experts from many countries are warning that ultra-processed foods are becoming very popular and are making people sick. These foods, like sugary snacks and packaged meals, are replacing healthy foods such as fruits and vegetables. Big companies use advertising and political influence to sell more of these foods, which can lead to diseases like obesity and diabetes. The experts want governments to take action by putting warning labels on these foods, limiting ads, and making healthy foods cheaper and easier to get. This is important because eating too much ultra-processed food can harm our health over time.",

    "Ultra-processed foods are items like chips, soda, and frozen dinners that are made in factories with lots of added sugars, fats, and artificial flavors. They are designed to be tasty and last a long time, but they often lack important nutrients like vitamins and fiber. Eating too much of these foods can lead to health problems such as gaining too much weight, heart disease, and diabetes. Many countries are seeing more people eat these foods instead of fresh, whole foods. Experts are concerned because this trend is hurting public health, and they believe governments should help by making healthy foods more available and educating people about good eating habits."
