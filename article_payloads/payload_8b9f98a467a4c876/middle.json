  "title": "The Global Rise of Ultra-Processed Foods and Health Risks",
  "summary": "A new series in The Lancet, authored by 43 international experts, highlights the alarming increase in ultra-processed food consumption worldwide and its severe health implications. These foods, defined by the Nova classification, are industrially made with low-cost ingredients and additives, displacing healthier options and leading to poor diet quality. Evidence shows that high UPF intake is linked to chronic diseases such as obesity, type 2 diabetes, and cardiovascular issues, with consumption rising significantly in countries like Spain, China, and Brazil. The authors criticize large corporations for using marketing and lobbying to boost sales and hinder public health policies. They call for coordinated government actions, including front-of-package labels, marketing restrictions, and taxes, to promote access to nutritious foods. Despite ongoing scientific debates about UPF definitions, the experts stress that immediate measures are necessary to combat this public health crisis and protect communities from corporate influences.",

  "background_read": [
    "Ultra-processed foods are a category in the Nova food classification system, developed in 2009, which groups foods based on their extent and purpose of industrial processing. These foods often contain ingredients like hydrogenated oils, protein isolates, and artificial additives, and they are designed to be convenient, hyper-palatable, and long-lasting. Historically, the shift towards UPFs began with industrialization and globalization, leading to increased consumption in both high-income and developing countries. This trend is driven by corporate strategies that include aggressive marketing, political lobbying, and the production of low-cost items. Research over the past decades has linked UPFs to various health issues, such as obesity and cardiovascular diseases, due to their poor nutritional profiles and potential to cause overeating. Understanding this background helps explain why experts are urging for policy interventions to mitigate the health impacts and promote sustainable food systems."
