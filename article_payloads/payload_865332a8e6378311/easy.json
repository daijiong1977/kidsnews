  "title": "A Look at Mental Health and ADHD Services in England",
  "summary": "Health Secretary Wes Streeting is starting a review to check why more people are asking for help with mental health, ADHD, and autism in England. The review will see if some people are being diagnosed too much and what help is missing. The government says they are putting money into services, but many people wait a long time for therapy. NHS numbers show that mental health problems and ADHD have gone up a lot over the last 20 years. Streeting wants to make sure everyone gets the right diagnosis and support quickly. A professor named Peter Fonagy will lead the review, and the results will come out in the summer. The review aims to listen to people who are affected and give honest advice.",
