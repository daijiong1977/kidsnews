  "title": "How Immune Cells Help Fight Colon Cancer",
  "summary": "In most cancers, a type of immune cell called regulatory T cells can make it harder for the body to fight the disease. But in colon cancer, having more of these cells is linked to better survival, which is unusual. Scientists have found that not all regulatory T cells are the same. In colon cancer, there are two kinds: one helps stop tumor growth, and the other helps it grow. This discovery could lead to better treatments for colon cancer and other similar diseases. The study used mice to learn about human colon cancer and was done by experts at a cancer research center.",
