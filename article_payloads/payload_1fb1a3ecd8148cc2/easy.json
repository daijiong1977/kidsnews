  "title": "UK Economy Shrinks a Little in October",
  "summary": "The UK economy got a bit smaller in October, which was a surprise because experts thought it would grow. The Office for National Statistics said the economy shrank by 0.1%. This happened partly because a cyber-attack at Jaguar Land Rover slowed down car making, and people and businesses spent less money before the Budget. The Bank of England might lower interest rates next week to help the economy. The government wants to make the economy grow by cutting energy bills and building things. Some people blame the Budget for the problem, while others say it's a reason for the Bank to act.",

    "The UK economy is like a big machine that makes and spends money. Sometimes it grows, meaning more jobs and things to buy, and sometimes it shrinks, which can be a problem. The government and Bank of England try to help it grow by making plans and setting interest rates. A cyber-attack is when hackers break into computers to cause trouble, like stopping car factories. The Budget is a yearly plan where the government decides how to spend money and collect taxes, which affects everyone."
