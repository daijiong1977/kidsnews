  "title": "Building Small Nuclear Power in Wales",
  "summary": "In north Wales, the UK is building its first small nuclear power station. This station will use small modular reactors, which are like tiny, safe nuclear machines that make electricity. At first, three reactors will be built, but there could be up to eight in the future. This project is important because it helps create clean energy without pollution, which is better for our planet. It will also provide jobs for people in the area and make sure we have enough power for homes and schools. Nuclear power is a way to get energy without burning fossil fuels like coal or oil, which can harm the environment. The government and companies are working together to make this happen safely. This is a big step for the UK in using new technology to fight climate change and keep the lights on.",

    "Nuclear power is a way to make electricity without burning fuels that pollute the air. Small modular reactors are smaller and safer than old nuclear plants. They can be built faster and help provide clean energy. In the UK, this project in Wales is part of efforts to reduce carbon emissions and fight climate change. It's important for kids to learn about different energy sources to understand how we can protect the environment."
