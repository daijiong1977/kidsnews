  "title": "Federal Judge Extends Protection for Refugees in Minnesota Against Deportation",
  "summary": "A federal judge in Minnesota has extended a legal order that protects refugees from being arrested and deported. The order, issued by U.S. District Judge John Tunheim, prevents the Trump administration from enforcing a new policy that would allow the arrest of refugees who entered the U.S. legally but are still waiting for green cards. This policy, announced by the Department of Homeland Security in February, interprets immigration law to require refugees to return to federal custody one year after admission for green card review. Judge Tunheim criticized the policy in a 66-page opinion, calling it a \"dystopian nightmare\" that breaks promises made to refugees decades ago. He converted a temporary restraining order into a preliminary injunction, applying only in Minnesota but highlighting national implications. Refugee advocates, such as the International Refugee Assistance Project, praised the decision for allowing refugees to live without fear. The case continues as the judge raises constitutional concerns about the government's actions.",

    "Refugees are individuals who flee their home countries due to persecution, war, or violence, seeking safety in other nations like the U.S. Under U.S. law, refugees can apply for asylum and later for green cards to gain permanent residency. The Department of Homeland Security oversees immigration policies, and recent changes under the Trump administration have aimed to tighten rules. In this case, a new memo interpreted immigration law to require refugees to return to custody for green card reviews, which critics argue is harsh and unconstitutional. Federal judges, such as John Tunheim, have the authority to review these policies and issue orders to protect rights while cases are pending. This situation highlights ongoing debates about immigration, refugee protection, and the balance of power between government branches."
