  "title": "Judge Helps Refugees Stay Safe in Minnesota",
  "summary": "A judge in Minnesota has made a decision to protect refugees from being arrested and sent away. Refugees are people who come to the U.S. to escape danger in their home countries. The judge said a new rule from the government was unfair and scary, like a bad dream. This rule would have let officials arrest refugees who are waiting for their green cards, which are papers that let them stay legally. The judge's order means refugees in Minnesota can live without fear for now. Lawyers who help refugees are happy because this keeps families together. The judge thinks the government's plan breaks promises made to refugees long ago. This case is still going on, but the judge's decision helps refugees feel safer.",

    "Refugees are people who have to leave their homes because it's not safe there, like from war or unfair treatment. They come to places like the U.S. for protection. In the U.S., they often apply for green cards to stay legally. Judges in courts help decide if rules are fair. This story is about a judge in Minnesota who said a new government rule was unfair to refugees, so he made an order to protect them from being arrested while they wait for their green cards."
