  "title": "Farm Tax Change: Helping Family Farms",
  "summary": "The government wanted to tax farms when they are passed down in families, but after many farmers protested, they changed their plan. Originally, farms worth over £1 million would have a 20% tax starting in 2026, but now only farms worth over £2.5 million will be taxed. This means more family farms won't have to pay this tax. The Environment Secretary said they listened to farmers to protect ordinary families. Farmers are happy because it helps them, but some still worry because farms with expensive land or machines might still be taxed. Protests happened outside Parliament, and some politicians disagreed with the tax. This change is a step to support farmers who grow food for Britain.",

    "In Britain, farms are important for growing food and supporting rural communities. Sometimes, when a farm is passed from parents to children, the government might tax it. This tax is called inheritance tax. Recently, the government planned a new tax on farms worth over £1 million, but after farmers protested, they raised the limit to £2.5 million to help more family farms. This shows how people can work together to change rules."
