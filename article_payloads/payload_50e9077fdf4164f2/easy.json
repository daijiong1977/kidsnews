  "title": "Why a New Flu Shot Was Not Approved",
  "summary": "The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) decided not to look at a new flu vaccine made by Moderna, even though tests showed it was safe and worked well. This vaccine uses mRNA technology, which is a new way to make vaccines that was used for COVID-19 shots. Many people, including doctors and scientists, are worried because this decision might show that the government is not supporting new vaccine ideas. An expert named Dr. Michael Osterholm talked about this on a news show, saying it 'sends chills' because it could slow down progress in fighting diseases. The rejection is linked to criticism from Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who does not like mRNA technology. This means that for now, people cannot get this new flu shot, and it might affect how vaccines are made in the future.",

    "The FDA is a U.S. government agency that makes sure medicines and vaccines are safe before people can use them. mRNA is a new way to create vaccines that teaches our bodies to fight viruses, like what was used for COVID-19 shots. Moderna is a company that makes vaccines using this technology. When a vaccine is rejected, it means it is not approved for use, which can worry experts who want new tools to prevent diseases. Dr. Michael Osterholm is a scientist who studies how diseases spread and how to stop them, so his opinion is important in this discussion."
