  "title": "Scientists Help Mice Grow Cartilage to Stop Arthritis",
  "summary": "Scientists at Stanford found a way to help older mice grow back knee cartilage and stop arthritis. They used an injection that blocks a protein called 15-PGDH, which increases as animals age and causes cartilage loss. This treatment also prevented arthritis after knee injuries like those in athletes. In tests, human cartilage samples from knee surgeries responded well and started making new cartilage. The researchers hope this could lead to a pill or injection for people to regrow lost cartilage, reducing the need for surgery. This is exciting because current treatments only manage pain or replace joints, but this targets the root cause of arthritis.",

    "Arthritis is a common problem where joints hurt and swell up, often in older people. Cartilage is like a cushion in joints that wears down over time, causing pain. Scientists study mice to find new medicines because their bodies work similarly to humans in some ways. This research is important because it could help millions of people avoid surgery and feel better."
