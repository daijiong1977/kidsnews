  "title": "Anthropogenic Dispersal and Early Domestication of Solanum jamesii in the American Southwest",
  "summary": "A 2026 study published in PLOS One investigates the anthropogenic dispersal of the Four Corners potato (Solanum jamesii) by ancient Indigenous communities in the southwestern United States over 10,000 years ago. Led by Lisbeth Louderback of the University of Utah, the research employs a multidisciplinary approach, analyzing starch granules on ground stone tools from 14 archaeological sites, with evidence dating to 10,900 cal BP, and integrating genetic sequencing data that indicates northern populations originated from southern regions. This suggests active human transport extended the plant's range into Utah and Colorado, beyond its natural habitat. The study identifies repeated use and movement as key indicators of incipient domestication, highlighting how early societies shaped plant ecology. Furthermore, it incorporates ethnobotanical interviews with 15 Navajo elders, confirming the potato's enduring cultural relevance for food and spiritual practices. The findings define an anthropogenic range distinct from natural distribution, revealing a unique cultural identity fostered by ancient plant transport. This work underscores the role of Indigenous agency in biogeography and domestication processes, challenging passive narratives of plant evolution and emphasizing the integration of scientific and traditional knowledge systems in understanding long-term human-environment interactions.",

    "This article presents a 2026 study on the ancient anthropogenic dispersal of Solanum jamesii, the Four Corners potato, in the American Southwest. Utilizing a multidisciplinary framework, researchers combine archaeobotanical analysis of starch granules on stone tools from 14 sites, with genetic evidence showing human-mediated northward spread from southern origins, dating back to 10,900 cal BP. This indicates incipient domestication processes driven by Indigenous communities. Ethnobotanical interviews with Navajo elders reveal ongoing cultural significance, linking past and present traditions. The study critiques passive models of plant evolution by foregrounding Indigenous agency in biogeography and domestication. It underscores the value of integrating scientific methods with traditional knowledge to elucidate long-term human-environment dynamics, offering insights into early agricultural practices, cultural identity formation, and the co-evolution of societies and plant species in pre-Columbian North America."

    "Main Points: The study demonstrates anthropogenic dispersal of Solanum jamesii over 10,000 years ago through starch and genetic evidence, indicating early domestication and cultural identity linked to Indigenous transport. Purpose: To explore human agency in plant biogeography and domestication, integrating interdisciplinary data to challenge evolutionary narratives. Evidence Evaluation: Robust, with direct microbotanical residues, corroborative genetic data, and qualitative interviews, though limited by archaeological sample representativeness. Author Credibility: Lisbeth Louderback, an archaeobotanist at the University of Utah, with NSF support, ensuring scholarly rigor. Methodology: Includes starch granule analysis on stone tools, genetic sequencing of potato populations, and ethnobotanical interviews, employing a mixed-methods approach. Critical Assessment: Strengths lie in multidisciplinary integration and emphasis on Indigenous knowledge; limitations include potential biases in interview sampling and gaps in archaeological coverage, suggesting need for broader spatial-temporal analysis."
