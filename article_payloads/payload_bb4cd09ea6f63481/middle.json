  "title": "Ancient Transport of Wild Potato in the American Southwest",
  "summary": "A study published in 2026 reveals that over 10,000 years ago, ancient people in the southwestern United States transported a wild ancestor of the modern potato, known as the Four Corners potato (Solanum jamesii), across long distances. Led by Lisbeth Louderback of the University of Utah, researchers examined ground stone tools from 14 archaeological sites, identifying starch granules from the potato on tools at nine sites, with evidence dating back to 10,900 cal BP. This suggests that Indigenous communities actively moved the plant, extending its range northward into areas like Utah and Colorado, beyond its original habitat. Genetic research supports this, showing that some northern populations of the potato originated farther south. The repeated use and movement of the plant indicate early stages of domestication, where people began shaping its future. Additionally, the study involved interviews with 15 Navajo elders, confirming that the wild potato remains culturally significant, used for food and spiritual purposes today. This research combines archaeobotanical data, genetic sequencing, and Indigenous knowledge to highlight how ancient human actions influenced plant distribution and cultural identity in the region.",

    "This article discusses a 2026 study on the ancient transport of the Four Corners potato in the American Southwest. Researchers, led by Lisbeth Louderback, analyzed starch granules on stone tools from archaeological sites, dating back over 10,000 years, to show that Indigenous communities moved this wild potato, extending its range. Genetic evidence supports human-mediated spread, indicating early domestication. The study also incorporates interviews with Navajo elders, highlighting ongoing cultural significance. It explores how human actions shaped plant ecology and cultural traditions, using interdisciplinary methods like archaeobotany and genetics. This provides insights into early agricultural practices and the enduring impact of Indigenous knowledge on biodiversity and heritage."
