  "title": "Ancient People Moved a Wild Potato Long Ago",
  "summary": "A long time ago, more than 10,000 years back, people in the American Southwest carried a wild potato plant to new places. This plant is called the Four Corners potato, and it is small, tough, and full of good nutrients. Scientists studied old stone tools from 14 different sites where ancient people lived. They found tiny bits of potato starch on tools from nine of these sites, showing that people used the potato for food. This helped the potato spread beyond where it originally grew. The research was led by Lisbeth Louderback from the University of Utah. Today, Indigenous communities, like the Navajo, still know and use this wild potato, keeping their traditions alive. This story shows how ancient people shaped plants and cultures.",

    "This article talks about how ancient people in the American Southwest, over 10,000 years ago, moved a wild potato plant to new areas. Scientists used old stone tools to find tiny starch bits that prove people ate this potato. This helped the plant spread and may have started its domestication. Today, Indigenous communities like the Navajo still value and use this potato, showing how traditions last through time. It's a story about early human impact on plants and culture."
