  "title": "Rockets and Space Launches Around the World",
  "summary": "This article talks about rockets and space launches from different countries. A Chinese company is trying to land a rocket again after a first attempt. NASA is testing a big rocket called the Space Launch System for a Moon mission. Some countries like Australia, Canada, Germany, and Spain are giving money to build their own rockets because they want to launch satellites by themselves for safety. Germany's Rocket Factory Augsburg is working on a new rocket after a fire during a test. The United Arab Emirates launched a small rocket they made themselves. The article shows that many places are working hard to reach space.",
