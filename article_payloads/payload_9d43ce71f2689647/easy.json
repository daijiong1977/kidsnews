  "title": "Secret Videos and Online Harassment: A Story for Kids",
  "summary": "This article tells about women who were secretly filmed by men using smart glasses that look like normal glasses but have hidden cameras. The men recorded videos without asking permission and posted them on social media apps like TikTok and Instagram. In the videos, the men pretended to give dating advice to other men. The women, like Dilara and Kim, did not know they were being filmed and shared personal details, such as phone numbers or where they work. After the videos were posted online, many people watched them, and the women received unwanted messages and calls, making them feel sad and upset. The article explains that in some places, like the UK, there is no law against filming people in public without consent, but social media companies might remove videos if they break rules against bullying. It highlights how technology can be misused to hurt others and the importance of privacy.",

    "This article discusses a problem where technology is used to invade people's privacy. Smart glasses with hidden cameras allow strangers to record others without their knowledge, and these videos are shared on social media for views. The women in the story felt exploited because their personal moments were made public, leading to harassment. It's important to understand that everyone has a right to privacy, and filming someone without permission can cause harm. In some countries, laws about this are unclear, but social media platforms have rules to protect users from bullying. This story helps us think about how to use technology responsibly and respect others."
