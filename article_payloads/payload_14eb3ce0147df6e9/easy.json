  "summary": "The United States and Israel attacked Iran on Saturday, and Iran fought back by firing missiles and drones at Israel and U.S. bases. World leaders from many countries are being careful in their reactions because they worry this could lead to a bigger war. Some countries like Australia and Canada support the U.S. strikes, while Russia and China criticize them. European leaders and the Arab League want peace talks instead of fighting. They say Iran should stop attacking other countries and let its people choose their future. The United Nations is holding an emergency meeting to discuss the situation.",
