  "title": "Global Reactions to U.S.-Israeli Strikes on Iran and Regional Tensions",
  "summary": "On Saturday, the United States and Israel conducted major strikes on Iran, prompting Iran to retaliate with missile and drone attacks on Israel and U.S. military bases in the Middle East. World leaders reacted cautiously, with many abstaining from direct comments to avoid straining relations with U.S. President Donald Trump, while condemning Iran's retaliation. Countries like Australia and Canada expressed open support for the strikes, whereas Russia and China offered direct criticism. European leaders, including those from Britain, France, and Germany, called for resumed negotiations and a negotiated settlement, emphasizing that military action alone cannot resolve issues like Iran's nuclear program. The Arab League condemned Iran's attacks as violations of sovereignty, and the U.N. Security Council scheduled an emergency meeting amid fears of a broader regional conflict. This situation highlights global concerns over escalating tensions and the need for diplomatic solutions.",
