  "title": "Exhibition Match Sparks Debate in Tennis World",
  "summary": "An upcoming exhibition tennis match in Dubai on December 28 features Aryna Sabalenka, the world's top-ranked women's player, and Nick Kyrgios, a former Wimbledon finalist, in what is being promoted as a modern 'battle of the sexes'. This references the historic 1973 match between Billie Jean King and Bobby Riggs, though King has noted that this new event differs significantly from the original. BBC reporter Jonathan Jurejko interviews both athletes to explore their motivations for participating and the controversy surrounding the match, particularly due to Kyrgios's past behavioral incidents. Additionally, Jurejko consults with expert Mani Djazmi to discuss the broader context and potential impact on tennis's public image. The story is part of the BBC World Service's daily podcast, More than the Score, which delves into sports narratives beyond mere results, covering various sports and featuring interviews with athletes and experts. The podcast aims to provide in-depth insights and engage listeners with diverse perspectives on global sports issues.",

    "Exhibition matches in tennis have a long history, often used to showcase talent or address social issues, such as the 1973 'Battle of the Sexes' between Billie Jean King and Bobby Riggs, which highlighted gender equality. Nick Kyrgios is known for his skilled play but also for controversial on-court behavior, impacting his public perception. The BBC World Service's More than the Score podcast represents a trend in sports media toward narrative-driven content that explores deeper themes like athlete psychology, societal impacts, and behind-the-scenes insights, rather than just game results. This context helps understand why an exhibition match can generate significant discussion beyond entertainment."
