  "title": "A Tennis Match with a Special Story",
  "summary": "Aryna Sabalenka, the best women's tennis player, and Nick Kyrgios, a famous tennis star, are playing a fun match in Dubai on December 28. People call it a 'battle of the sexes' because a man and woman are competing, like a famous match from long ago with Billie Jean King and Bobby Riggs. But Billie Jean King says this new match is different. A reporter from the BBC talks to Sabalenka and Kyrgios about why they want to play and why some people are talking about it, especially because of things Kyrgios did before. The reporter also talks to an expert to learn more about what this match means for tennis. This story is part of a podcast called More than the Score that shares cool sports stories every day, not just who wins or loses.",
