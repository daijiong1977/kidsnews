  "title": "Trump and Russia in Ukraine Peace Talks",
  "summary": "This article talks about a disagreement between leaders about a drone attack in Ukraine. The CIA, a U.S. spy agency, says Ukraine did not try to attack Russian President Putin's home with a drone, even though Putin told President Trump that they did. Trump seemed to believe Putin at first, but now he says he agrees with European leaders that Russia is stopping peace in Ukraine. The article also describes how Russia attacked a city in Ukraine on New Year's Eve, hurting civilians like old people and a baby, and destroying homes. It shows that the fighting is making it hard for people to live safely and for leaders to make peace.",

  "background_read": [
    "This article is about the war in Ukraine, which started when Russia invaded in 2022. Countries like the U.S. and Europe are trying to help Ukraine and stop the fighting. Leaders often talk to each other to make deals, but sometimes they disagree about what is true, like in this drone attack claim. The CIA helps find out facts to guide decisions. War hurts regular people by destroying their homes and making them leave, as shown in the attack on New Year's Eve. Understanding these events helps us see why peace is important but difficult to achieve."
