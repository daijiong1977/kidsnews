  "title": "A Story About Money and Promises",
  "summary": "This article is about a disagreement over money in the UK government. Rachel Reeves, who is in charge of the country's money, talked about problems with the economy before a big budget announcement. She said that the UK's ability to produce goods and services was weaker, which could make it hard to follow her spending rules. But later, a group called the Office for Budget Responsibility said that higher wages would help her meet those rules. The Conservative party, which is the opposition, accused her of lying to hide plans to raise taxes. Downing Street, where the prime minister works, denied that she misled anyone. It's a story about how leaders share information and argue about what's true.",
