  "title": "Scientists Make Heat Rules Work for Tiny Quantum Things",
  "summary": "Long ago, a scientist named Count Rumford watched cannons being made and saw that friction made them hot, leading to the idea that heat comes from motion. This helped create thermodynamics, the science of heat and energy. Today, thermodynamics has rules like energy staying the same and disorder always increasing, which work well for big things like engines. But for tiny quantum systems, like light trapped between mirrors, these rules get tricky because heat and work are hard to tell apart. Researchers at the University of Basel found a new way to define work and heat for laser light in quantum systems. They studied how coherent light (waves in sync) can do work, like charging a quantum battery, while incoherent light (waves out of sync) acts as heat. By counting only the coherent part as work, they showed that thermodynamics can still work in the quantum world, helping future technology.",

    "Thermodynamics started with Count Rumford in 1798, who saw that friction from drilling cannons made heat, showing heat comes from motion. This led to rules about energy and disorder that power things like steam engines. Today, scientists use these rules for big systems, but tiny quantum things, like particles of light, behave differently, making it hard to apply thermodynamics. Researchers are finding new ways to adapt these rules for quantum technology, which could help build better devices in the future."
