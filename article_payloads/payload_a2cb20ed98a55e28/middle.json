  "title": "Harnessing Space's Cold for Nighttime Power Generation",
  "summary": "Engineers at the University of California, Davis have developed a device that generates mechanical power at night by exploiting the temperature contrast between Earth's warmth and the extreme cold of outer space. Based on a Stirling engine, which efficiently converts heat differences into motion, this system operates without fuel by using deep space as a cold reservoir. Unlike internal combustion engines requiring large temperature gaps, Stirling engines function with modest differences, such as between a hot object and ambient air. In this setup, one side of the engine is warmed by the ground, while the other side is cooled radiatively by a panel that releases heat upward to space, driving a piston to produce mechanical energy. After a year of nighttime testing, the compact device generated at least 400 milliwatts per square meter, enough to power a small fan or produce electrical current via a motor. The technology shows promise for applications like ventilating greenhouses or buildings in regions with low humidity and clear skies, offering a sustainable alternative to conventional energy sources. A provisional patent has been filed, highlighting its potential for future development.",
