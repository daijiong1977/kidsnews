  "title": "Actor Intervenes in Assault and Faces Consequences",
  "summary": "Scottish actor and director Peter Mullan intervened in an assault incident near the O2 Academy in Glasgow on September 20 last year. He witnessed Dylan Bennet, 29, attacking a woman and stepped between them to protect her. Mullan informed Bennet that the police had been called, but Bennet responded by headbutting Mullan, causing a head injury. Bennet also brandished a glass bottle during the altercation. Security staff from the venue later restrained Bennet until police arrived. In court, Bennet pleaded guilty to assaulting both Mullan and the woman. Sheriff Iain Fleming sentenced Bennet to 18 months in jail. The incident highlights Mullan's courageous act and the legal repercussions for violent behavior. Bennet's defense lawyer mentioned that Bennet had been consuming alcohol and drugs, which contributed to the argument with his partner. This case underscores the importance of bystander intervention and the role of security and law enforcement in maintaining public safety.",
