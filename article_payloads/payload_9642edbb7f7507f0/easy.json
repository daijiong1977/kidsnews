  "title": "Mexico's President Calms Worries About U.S. Military Moves",
  "summary": "Mexico's President Claudia Sheinbaum helped people feel better after two U.S. military actions near Mexico made them worried. First, the U.S. warned planes to be careful flying over the ocean near Mexico because of military activities. Sheinbaum waited until the U.S. gave written promises that no U.S. military planes would fly over Mexico. Second, a U.S. military plane landed at an airport near Mexico City, and some people asked questions about it. Sheinbaum explained it was a training trip for Mexican workers, approved by Mexico's defense leader. These events made people nervous because of recent U.S. actions in Venezuela and talks about fighting drug cartels in Mexico. Sheinbaum and U.S. President Trump talked and agreed to work together on safety, but Mexico says its rules must be respected.",

    "Mexico is a country in North America that shares a border with the United States. The two countries often work together on issues like trade and safety, but sometimes disagreements happen. Recently, the U.S. took action in Venezuela, which made Mexico worried about similar moves near them. Military activities involve soldiers, planes, and other armed forces, and countries usually talk to each other before doing things that might affect their neighbors. Sovereignty means each country has the right to control what happens within its own borders without others interfering. This article is about how Mexico's leader reassured people after U.S. military actions caused concern."
