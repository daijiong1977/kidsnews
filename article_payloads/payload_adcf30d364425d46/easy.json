  "title": "Climate Expert Warns of Hotter Years Ahead in the UK",
  "summary": "A climate expert in the UK says that 2025 might be the hottest year ever recorded there. She warns that rising temperatures are becoming normal because of climate change, which is caused by pollution from human activities like burning fuels. This heat can lead to problems like droughts and wildfires. The expert, Professor Rachel Kyte, says we need to prepare by investing in things like better infrastructure and nature to handle the heat. She explains that if we don't act now, it will cost more later. Scientists from the Met Office, which tracks weather, agree that human actions are making the UK warmer, and they expect more hot years in the future. They use data to predict temperatures, but it's not certain yet if 2025 will break the record.",

    "Climate change is when the Earth's weather gets warmer because of things people do, like driving cars or using factories that release gases into the air. This can make summers hotter and cause less rain, leading to dry conditions. In the UK, experts are worried because recent years have been very warm, and they think this trend will continue. To stay safe, countries need to build stronger systems, like better water supplies and parks, to cope with the heat. Learning about climate helps us understand why it's important to reduce pollution and protect our planet."
