  "title": "Olivia Dean's Manchester Concert: A Warm-Up for the Brit Awards",
  "summary": "Olivia Dean, a rising British singer, performed a charity concert at Manchester's Albert Hall, just two days before the Brit Awards where she is nominated in five major categories, including Artist and Album of the Year. The show featured songs from her second album, The Art Of Loving, which blends soul vocals with modern pop influences from artists like Sade and Amy Winehouse. Despite the minimal staging and lighting typical of a low-key charity event, Dean captivated the audience with her radiant charisma, wearing a jade green ballgown and displaying irrepressible energy. Her band played entirely live without samples or backing tracks, complementing her dusky voice, while fans who had queued for hours cheered enthusiastically, making Dean feel a bit embarrassed. The concert highlighted her recent breakout success, following a US tour with Sabrina Carpenter, and underscored her likeable persona and lyrical incisiveness in depicting love stories.",
